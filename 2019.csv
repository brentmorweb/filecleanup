New rule attempts to tackle pollution from oil and gas wells,12/20/2019,"<p>On Jan. 19, 2016 Governor Tom Wolf <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-announces-new-methane-rules-to-improve-air-quality-reduce-industry-loss/"">announced a new strategy</a> to reduce the emissions of methane&mdash;a dangerous greenhouse gas&mdash;from the oil and natural gas industry.</p>

<p>In 2018, Governor Wolf and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) updated permits for new oil and natural gas operations to control for methane leakage. Unfortunately, between the Governor&rsquo;s announcement and the time these new permits were put in place, over 4,200 additional fracked gas wells were permitted. To control these wells and the tens of thousands of older existing sources, Governor Wolf announced the DEP would also &ldquo;expeditiously pursue the adoption of a regulation for existing sources.&rdquo; It might have taken nearly three years, but on Dec. 17, 2019, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Environmental Quality Board (EQB) voted to <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Air/Pages/Methane-Reduction-Strategy.aspx#.Vp6a0vkrJhE"">advance this proposed rulemaking.</a></p>

<p>While an important step, the proposed rulemaking still has some hurdles in the regulatory process before becoming law, but the rule also has some significant shortfalls. The DEP has presented the Environmental Quality Board with the regulatory language the agency would like to adopt along with supporting documentation and recommendations from various advisory committees, and the EQB has agreed to let the process move forward. While the rule&rsquo;s development process has been mostly internal within the DEP, we will see a notice in <a href=""http://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/"">the Pennsylvania Bulletin</a> early in 2020 which formally opens a public comment period. This will give the public the opportunity to weigh in with written comments and at public hearings.</p>

<p><u>Wait, the Rule Regulates VOC&rsquo;s and Not Methane?</u></p>

<p>As written, the rule specifically controls ozone-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by requiring thousands of existing facilities to adopt what is known as &ldquo;reasonably available control technology&rdquo; (RACT). In this case, RACT includes new standards for storage tanks and gas processing equipment along with requirements for leak detection and repair programs. While these are all specifically VOC controls, and methane is not a VOC under the <a href=""https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b77fd17146a534c225c8557b5ed4a469&amp;node=40:2.0.1.1.2.3.8.1&amp;rgn=div8"">Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s definitions</a>, the DEP predicts more than 75,000 tons of methane emissions will be avoided as a co-benefit of the program. Using VOC regulation as a surrogate to control methane may not be ideal, but it allowed the DEP to leverage work done at the federal level to establish Control Techniques Guidelines (CTGs) for these sources.</p>

<p><u>OK, So What Will the Environmental Impact of this Rule Be?</u></p>

<p>This rule will make the oil and gas production process a little cleaner, but it doesn&rsquo;t make the gas and petrochemical industry clean. Reducing 75,000 tons of methane a year won&rsquo;t fix the climate crisis alone, nor does it address all of the methane oil and gas operations are polluting into our atmosphere. In fact, the rule is only a small but necessary piece of what we need to do to cut greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change. At the rate our natural gas generation is expanding, even very conservative estimates suggest the industry will put all of that carbon pollution and more back in our air in a few short years. When we add even more pollution from sources like ethane cracker plants and other facilities, the window to see real reductions in carbon pollution from this rule gets even smaller. Pretending that we can drill our way to clean air and a healthy climate isn&rsquo;t the path forward.</p>

<p><u>How Can the Wolf Administration Make This Rule Stronger?</u></p>

<p>While the proposed rule is a positive step, more can be done to limit methane emissions. For example, the rule controls fugitive emissions by requiring qualifying wells to be inspected monthly by sight, sound, and smell and also quarterly using an instrument-based leak detection and repair (LDAR) systems such as infrared cameras and gas detectors that can identify and locate smaller leaks. Regularly checking for leaks isn&rsquo;t very difficult, but of the more than 71,000 conventional wells, the DEP estimates that all but 303 will be exempt from even this basic measure. Removing this exemption for low producing wells make sense&mdash;just because a well doesn&rsquo;t produce a lot of gas doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t have significant leaks.</p>

<p>The rule also weakens the LDAR provision by letting operators test less frequently if the initial testing does not find sufficient leaks. If a part wears out or breaks and a new leak develops, that could mean months of additional uncontrolled emissions before the problem is caught.The Department should correct this and require all sources conduct regular inspections for leaks.</p>

<p><u>It&rsquo;s Time to Act on Climate</u></p>

<p>Making this rule as strong as possible and finalizing it without delay is a step in the right direction, but we should expect opposition. Anti-environmental forces will work to weaken, delay, and de-fund these rules at the same time they are <a href=""/Files/News/PennFuture-Policy-Memo---EnergizePA---6-7-19DRAFT.pdf"">promoting increased subsidies for the oil and gas industry.</a> We believe the people of Pennsylvania want action on climate change and strong common-sense emission controls on polluting industries, but some people in Harrisburg clearly haven&rsquo;t heard that message.</p>

<p>In the new year, we&rsquo;ll be asking our members and friends to help fix that problem by sending in comments in support of a stronger rule and opposing attempts to increase pollution. But we also need to be realistic that making the oil and gas industry modestly cleaner, like the rule as currently written would do, won&rsquo;t solve the climate crisis. Much more needs to be done. Our elected officials have a constitutional obligation to take meaningful action in the fight against climate change and they need to hear from the public that we expect nothing less.</p>

The Dangers of Senate Bill 790,12/19/2019,"<p>As soon as the Chamber returns to legislative session in January, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives is poised to take up Senate Bill 790, an unprecedented rollback of environmental protections across the state. Our elected leaders must stand against this potentially devastating bill by voting against the bill.</p>

<p>The oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania, including conventional drillers, is prominent and extremely lucrative. The revenues, however, come at the cost of damaging our environment and health, and exacerbates our climate change concerns. According to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Health, there have been approximately 350,000 conventional oil and gas wells and roughly 10,000 unconventional oil and gas wells drilled across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Despite the overwhelmingly large gap between the two types of drilling, conventional oil and gas drilling has declined recently due to large investments and the production of much larger operations in unconventional drilling. SB 790, put forth by Senator Joe Scarnati, aims to revive the conventional industry, but at the expense of undoing years of regulations by reenacting the Oil andGas Act of 1984. Conventional drilling advocates argue that their industry is different than those employing hydraulic fracturing methods in Pennsylvania, but there is no difference in spills and dirty water, whethercaused by conventional or unconventional drilling industries.</p>

<p><u>Loosening Requirements for Industry While Putting Water at Risk</u></p>

<p>SB 790 capitulates to the oil and gas industry to help &ldquo;optimize&rdquo; Pennsylvania&rsquo;s natural resources for the industry&rsquo;s economic benefit. The bill encourages and promotes dirty energy usage in Pennsylvania and puts our water quality at risk. Though this threatens the future, the immediate effects on the environment and human health are far more troubling and outweigh the monetary and economic benefits it might bring. Generally, SB 790 loosens restrictions and facilitates a lack of accountability for the oil and natural gas industry.</p>

<p>For example, the bill allows up to 5 barrels of oil and up to 15 barrels of oil and gas water to be spilled and go unreported. This affects downstream users who are unaware that the spill even occurred.Moreover, SB 790 prohibits communities from creating more protective regulations to keep leaks and spills away from homes, schools, and otherbuildings, which is simply irresponsible.</p>

<p>One of the most concerning issues is with replacement water due to an unexpected spill, leak, or emergency.The tainted water must be replaced, but that water does not have to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act standards.This is a dangerous precedent as it allows for entities to pollute our state&rsquo;s precious water resources with unfiltered, dirty wastewater that is not safe for drinking or even swimming.</p>

<p><u>Toxicity Potential &amp; Health Impacts of Drilling Wastewater</u></p>

<p>This bill also allows for brine, or untreated wastewater, to be used as a dust suppressant on roads throughout Pennsylvania, which directly violates the Solid Waste Management Act, in which potentially toxic wastewater isn&rsquo;t allowed on roads. Excess brine runoff can easily make its way into waterways and systems for drinking water and recreational activities.</p>

<p><a href=""https://extension.psu.edu/potential-health-impacts-of-oil-and-gas-wastewater-on-roads"">In a recent study</a>on the health impacts of oil andgas wastewater on roads, researchers at Penn State University found that there is a large potential to aquatic and human toxicity caused by the application of wastewater brine on roads.The study claimed that, &ldquo;Through a variety of experiments simulating (oil and gas)wastewater application to roads, followed by simulated rain events, the majority of contaminants were found not to be retained in the road. The high salt concentrations are likely the major potential threat to aquatic toxicity, requiring up to 1,600 times dilution to reach drinking water quality standards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Penn State researchers also disturbingly found that radium, a carcinogen from oil andgas wastewater, was found to leave the roads, impacting local watersheds. This wastewater is exempt from reporting, meaning the chemicals in the water do not have to be identified and can be kept confidential even whenimproperly disposedonto Pennsylvania land and water.SB 790 goes beyond that to specify that brine will no longer be defined as &ldquo;waste.&rdquo; Pennsylvania roads are already bombarded with enough salt to combat ice, and there is no need for Pennsylvania citizens to be exposed to more dangerous and toxic chemicals on our streets and in our water.</p>

<p><u>Stop Senate Bill 790</u></p>

<p>Currently, SB 790 is in the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, which is led by Republican Chairman Daryl Metcalfe. It is imperative that House members oppose Senate Bill 790. The conventional oil andgas industry should not have weaker rules for clean water protection, and rolling back regulations 35 years is obscene. We, as a state, have come too far and are too close to a brighter, cleaner future to roll back and roll over now.</p>

<p>Tell your State Representative to protect our water quality and <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/staterep_voteno_sb790"">OPPOSE Senate Bill 790 today.</a></p>

Facing the Frack: Gas is Not Enhancing our Environment,12/19/2019,"<p>The fracked gas industry and its proponents excel at spinning false narratives about the health and safety of its operations, and often don&rsquo;t tell the whole story when faced with facts.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, <a href=""https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/news/stories/2019/december/nicholas-muller-research-shale-gas.html"">a groundbreaking study</a>publishedby Carnegie Mellon University on Dec.8that found that for every three jobs created by the shale gas industry, someone&rsquo;s life in the region iscut short by a year because of associated pollution.</p>

<p>While not addressing the study specifically, industry trade group Marcellus Shale Coalition <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2019/12/08/shale-development-natural-gas-drilling-fracking-costs-health-study-pennsylvania-cmu/stories/201912060038"">emailed a statement</a> to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, saying that &ldquo;we believe firmly&hellip;that natural gas is unquestionably enhancing our environment and air quality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not, and there is recent and ample evidence to prove so. Look at a headline that broke earlier this week to find the fallacy within that statement: in February 2018, a blowout at a single gas well in Ohio&mdash;about 70 miles southwest of Pittsburgh&mdash;resulted in more than 60 kilotons of methane escaping into the atmosphere over a 20 day period.</p>

<p>Methane, the colorless and odorless main component of fracked gas, is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas that can <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/climate/methane-leak-satellite.html"">warm the planet more than 80 times as much</a> as the same amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.It was a total disaster for the climate.</p>

<p>The massive leak in Ohio released about 120 metric tons of methane into the atmosphere per hour. The incident also forced about 100 residents to evacuate the area, residents who had previously complained about throat irritation, dizziness and other breathing problems.</p>

<p>To put it into perspective, this single incident resulted in more methane leaking into the atmosphere <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/ohio-exxon-mobil-methane-leak-satellite-climate-change/index.html"">than most countries release in an entire year.</a></p>

<p>The methane leak and its consequences are frightening enough, but what about the fact that it took nearly two years to uncover the scope of the incident? According to <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/climate/methane-leak-satellite.html"">the New York Times</a>, the scale only became known after an analysis was undertaken by a satellite specifically designed to monitor the planet for methane leaks.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s just one well. According to the Energy Information Administration, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/ohio-exxon-mobil-methane-leak-satellite-climate-change/index.html"">there are 991,000 oil and natural gas wells</a> in the United States, in addition to an <a href=""https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/proposed-methane-emissions-rule-passes-pennsylvania-environmental-quality-board/"">estimated 80,000 conventional oil and gas wells </a>and about 10,651 active unconventional gas wells in Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p>Groups like the Marcellus Shale Coalition can make statements about fracked gas enhancing our environment because, compared to coal, fracked gas is a cleaner option. Its true fracked gas burns much cleaner than coal and produces <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/climate/methane-leak-satellite.html"">only about half the carbon dioxide</a> than coal does.</p>

<p>That one fact, however, doesn&rsquo;t give the industry license to peddle its product as safe or clean. Carbon dioxide isn&rsquo;t the only greenhouse gas destroying our climate, and burning fossil fuels for electricity isn&rsquo;t the only way for greenhouse gases to enter the atmosphere.</p>

<p>What about the tons and tons of methane that escapeundetected from the hundreds of thousands of oil and gas wells across the country? What about the health effects of living next to natural gas infrastructure that pollutes our air and water?</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/12/17/Pennsylvania-DEP-methane-VOC-rule-existing-oil-and-gas-wells-Marcellus-shale/stories/201912170126"">New rules and regulations are advancing</a> in Pennsylvania&mdash;the country&rsquo;s second-largest natural gas producer&mdash;to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds from oil and gas operations statewide. It&rsquo;s been estimated the regulations could help cut methane emissions by about 75,000 tons a year.</p>

<p>If this rule is enacted, it could make the gas and petrochemical industries marginally cleaner, but it most certainly will not make them clean. &ldquo;Cleaner than coal&rdquo; does not mean natural gas is clean or sustainable. It is neither,and propagating that narrative is intentional misdirection that fails to tell the entire story.</p>

<p>In the past two weeks, we&rsquo;ve been presented with evidence that lifespans in western Pennsylvania are being cut short because of the fracked gas industry, while we were also presented with evidence that 60 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere as part of a single incident.</p>

<p>Does that sound like an industry that is enhancing our environment and improving our air quality?</p>

GivingTuesday a big success for PennFuture,12/16/2019,"

<p>The holidays are for giving.<br />
<br />
We give because it makes us feel good. Whether you celebrate Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa, the winter solstice, or something else during these cold, dark days, we are all celebrating our community and sharing gratitude with our loved ones at the end of the year.<br />
<br />
And what better way to kick offthese celebrations than witha new holiday: the day we celebrate giving&mdash;GivingTuesday, which took place on December 3rd. Seven years ago, the GivingTuesday movement was born on social media as part as the non-profit community&rsquo;s response to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and has now become the &ldquo;start date&rdquo; for the end of year holiday giving season. This global day of giving has become the biggest giving day of the year.<br />
<br />
This year PennFuture had a goal of raising $10,000 for GivingTuesday while encouraging new donors. We got <em>really</em> close, raising $9,532.49 in 24 hours! Part of that included a match of $4,690 from GivingTuesday donors from last year, which we surpassed! Thanks to your donations, PennFuture&rsquo;s GivingTuesday Challenge Match was a success. What is most exciting is that of the 83 donors who gave on that day, 25 of them were new donors!<br />
<br />
What a great start to our end of year giving campaign! These new donors are also new members, and the more members we have the more attention our elected leaders must pay to us.<br />
<br />
If you didnt get a chance to donate on GivingTuesday, its okay! There is still plenty of time to make your 2019 donation this season and keep your membership active. GivingTuesday is a wonderful day of celebrating philanthropy and the work so many great charities do. But really, it is just one day. PennFutures work goes on all year long because environmental watchdogs never sleep! And thats what we are, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s watchdog for clean air, pure water, and a healthy climate.<br />
<br />
PennFuture is leading the transition to a clean energy economy in Pennsylvania and beyond. With your support we are protecting our air, water and land, and empowering citizens to build sustainable communities for future generations.<br />
<br />
I can&rsquo;t think about giving at the holidays without thinking about the famous literary character Ebenezer Scrooge. It is through charitable giving that Scrooge understands the meaning of the holiday. He gave because it made him feel as light as a feather, happy as an angel, merry as a schoolboy. He gave because it made him feel good.<br />
<br />
I hope you feel just as good this year.<br />
<br />
On behalf of us all at PennFuture, I thank you for your givingand wish you peace, love, and joy during this wonderful holiday season, and a happy new year!</p>

"Reflections on 2019, and Looking Ahead to 2020",12/13/2019,"<p>It&rsquo;s the end of another year, and what a momentous year it was. The holiday season often offers time for reflection, and Ive compiled some thoughts below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>2019 was the Year of our Climate Youth, and we are grateful every day for their bold activism and ambition.</li>
	<li>2019 was the year that the stakes in the fight to stop Pennsylvania&rsquo;s blind embrace of gas for energy and petrochemicals rose to new heights. Words were spoken, sides were taken, industry plans were exposed, and the public noticed.</li>
	<li>2019 is nearly over and that brings us closer&ndash;finally&ndash;to 2020.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am so proud of PennFuture. Our work continues to be essential and at a crucial time. In order to address threats to clean air, pure water, a healthy climate and sane energy policy, PennFuture must work in partnership, collaboration and coalition with many other groups, and we do. But I will boast on a few highlights in 2019 where our organizational signature of excellence is shining through.</p>

<p>On October 19, Governor Tom Wolf issued an important climate-related executive order, beginning a 24-month regulatory process that will lead to a cap on carbon pollution in Pennsylvania and our participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) market.PennFuture&rsquo;s Energy Center Director Rob Altenburg <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2019/09/25/Rob-Altenburg-Pennsylvania-should-join-the-Regional-Greenhouse-Gas-Initiative-but-for-the-right-reasons/stories/201909250048"">has been front and center</a> in keeping the public informed on what RGGI is about and how it can help address climate pollution.</p>

<p>In the last several weeks, Rob faced fire in Rep. Daryl Metcalfe&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/the-stakes-are-too-high-climate-skeptics-meet-their-own-critics-at-state-house-committee-hearing/"">Energy and Environment Committee</a> and on talk radio. To demonstrate what we are up against, read this piece about Speaker Mike Turzai&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.energyandpolicy.org/pennsylvania-house-speaker-says-he-will-rely-on-help-from-oil-gas-lawyers-in-lawsuits-to-oppose-joining-rggi/"">audacious alignment with the gas industry</a> to demolish RGGI.</p>

<p>The gas industry&rsquo;s response to Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto&rsquo;s remarks opposing a petrochemical buildout has been loud, monied and consistent. PennFuture&rsquo;s Media Relations Director Jared Stonesifer has launched a rapid response blog to bust myths propagated by the industry and its spokespeople. You can <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fallacy-Fiction-and-Falsehoods"">have a look here</a>.</p>

<p>Through a unique partnership with students at Vermont Law School&rsquo;s Environmental Advocacy Clinic, PennFuture is suing industrial polluters who are violating clean water laws along the Delaware River. Our focus on protecting the exceptional value headwaters of the river continues as we watchdog energy and transportation projects that stand to adversely impact the best water quality in our state. In addition, we are in litigation against the Environmental Protection Agency for failure to set coal oven standards in a timely manner. This exceptional work advances under the leadership of our senior attorneys Alice Baker and Abby Jones.</p>

<p>Following the lineage of our successful high profile advertising campaigns Toxic Neighbor (targeting perpetual air quality violations at U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Clairton Coke Works) and Our Pocono Waters (targeting misguided development that will impact Pocono headwaters), we launched our Keep Philly Green &amp; Water Clean campaign, drawing attention to green stormwater management and the open space, public health, recreational and habitat benefits it provides, and we are encouraging the city of Philadelphia to remain a national leader with these programs.</p>

<p>Our Clean Energy Pittsburgh campaign is endeavoring to bring clean energy to Wilkinsburg, Swissvale and Braddock. These campaigns all take place under the leadership of staff including Jay Andrews, Lena Smith, Emily Baldauff, Annie Regan and Kelsey Krepps.</p>

<p>This year of 2019 produced a new strategic plan for the organization, under the leadership of our Vice President and Chief of Staff Matt Stepp. PennFuture has a different voice and will unapologetically champion a better future for Pennsylvania, one where the rights guaranteed by our environmental rights amendment prevail over the pollution of our people and natural resources. There is much work to do.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I am looking forward to in 2020:</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s Civic Engagement program will be front and center in counties all over the state as we organize volunteers, work on non-partisan voter registration and get out the vote efforts.Staff including Josh McNeil and Mike Mehrazar will be very, very busy.PennFuture&rsquo;s reach will extend into new places including Erie, Lehigh and Bucks counties.</p>

<p>Our state legislature will be back in session, struggling to govern and do the will of the people.All eyes will be on the so-called Energize package of bills that propose to subsidize petrochemical infrastructure and manufacturing.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s policy director Ezra Thrush will be focused on that and stopping the constant onslaught of attempts to roll back regulations that protect public health and our environment. On the positive side of possibilities, there is renewed interest in electric vehicle support infrastructure and community energy proposals that have a decent chance of success.</p>

<p>We earnestly hope the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day will reset and re-invigorate the environmental movement and the day will turn out diverse and intergenerational peoples bringing a clarion call to elected officials: the peoples of the earth deserve a future,the time has come to act boldly on climate.</p>

<p>Finally, on November 3, 2020 the United States will elect its next president. If you make no other New Year resolution, make sure everyone you know who is eligible to vote is registered, and make sure they vote on Election Day. We must cast votes on behalf of our environment and our earth, and if we do, next year at this time, our hope for the future and our planet will be renewed.</p>

<p><u><strong>Introduction and Context</strong></u></p>

<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto <a href=""https://www.nextpittsburgh.com/features/i-oppose-any-additional-petrochemical-companies-heres-what-mayor-peduto-said-at-the-climate-action-summit/"">ignited a firestorm</a> in late October when he voiced opposition to further expansion of the petrochemical industry in western Pennsylvania. The mayor&rsquo;s stance kicked off <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2019/11/27/the-plastics-debate-heats-up-both-sides-are.html?ana=wpxi"">a heated debate</a> that has unfolded between local and state politicians, business leaders and citizens about the future not just of western Pennsylvania but the entire state.</p>

<p>The debate reached <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/in-radio-interview-wolf-breaks-with-pittsburghs-peduto-on-nat-gas-enraging-environmentalists/"">as far as Gov. Tom Wolf</a>, who sided with Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald in supporting the industry and its expansion. A letter <a href=""https://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/news/20191120/county-leaders-petrochemical-industry-welcome-in-western-pennsylvania"">signed by 20 regional elected officials</a> circulated in support of the industry, while one state representative <a href=""https://www.pahouse.com/Burns/InTheNews/NewsRelease/?id=111632"">petitioned ExxonMobil to scout</a> his district for a potential ethane cracker plant.</p>

<p>These letters, press releases and public statements continue to make assertions that are misleading and serve only as industry talking points to further the goal of turning Pennsylvania into the next petrochemical hub.</p>

<p><strong>Myth: The petrochemical industry is Pennsylvania&rsquo;s &ldquo;lifeline to the future.&rdquo;</strong> In a letter signed by <a href=""https://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/news/20191120/county-leaders-petrochemical-industry-welcome-in-western-pennsylvania"">more than 20 regional elected officials</a>&mdash;including Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and 16 county commissioners from western Pennsylvania&mdash;it was stated that the fracked gas industry has &ldquo;breathed life back into our communities&rdquo; and that the petrochemical industry is our &ldquo;lifeline to the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Fact: The petrochemical industry, even if built to capacity, will have a negligible impact on regional employment.</strong> Shell&rsquo;s cracker plant in Beaver County is expected to employ <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/06/20/petrochemical-Appalachian-Shell-cracker-promoter-Washington-jobs-DOE-Ohio/stories/201906200133"">roughly 500 people</a> once the plant is operational, meaning jobs at the cracker plant will represent less than 1 percent of the county&rsquo;s workforce of <a href=""https://www.workstats.dli.pa.gov/Documents/County%20Profiles/Beaver%20County.pdf"">more than 81,000 people.</a></p>

<p>By comparison, <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/pennsylvania.htm#eag"">more than 6.2 million people</a> are employed in Pennsylvania, meaning that full employment at the cracker plant represents less than0.01 percent of the state&rsquo;s employed workforce.</p>

<p><strong>Myth: The future success of western Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy relies on petrochemicals</strong>. In a recent interview <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2019/11/27/the-plastics-debate-heats-up-both-sides-are.html?ana=wpxi"">with the Pittsburgh Business Times</a>, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said elected officials &ldquo;need to be reasonable and realistic in where the future lies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Fact: Employment in the clean energy sector is already driving Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy without the help of state taxpayer subsidies</strong>. There are more than 90,000 people employed in the clean energy sector in Pennsylvania, <a href=""https://www.e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-pennsylvania-2019/"">according to a 2019 economic analysis</a>, and the sector is adding jobs five times faster than the overall state employment growth rate. Since 2014, the clean energy industry has increased employment in Pennsylvania by nearly 60 percent, putting the state nearly into the top 10 nationally in total employment in clean energy.</p>

<p>Despite that, state lawmakers <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/08/13/Shell-cracker-Trump-protesters-plastics-ethane-oil-gas-Beaver-EPA-regulations-pennsylvania/stories/201908130059"">handed out $1.6 billion in tax</a><a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/08/13/Shell-cracker-Trump-protesters-plastics-ethane-oil-gas-Beaver-EPA-regulations-pennsylvania/stories/201908130059"">breaks</a>for Shell to build a petrochemical facility in Beaver County. That&rsquo;s equivalent to more than $3million for each of the 500 permanent jobs at the plant&mdash;an enormous giveaway to one of the biggest and more profitable corporations on the planet. Compare this further to the state of New York, where leaders in 2018 committed $1.5 billion <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/new-york-to-invest-1-5-billion-in-renewable-energy-projects"">to create 40,000 renewable energy jobs</a> in the state, about $37,500 per job.</p>

<p><strong>Myth: If Pennsylvania becomes the next petrochemical hub, ordinary residents will benefit</strong>. In early December, <a href=""https://www.pahouse.com/Burns/InTheNews/NewsRelease/?id=111632"">State Rep. Frank Burns (D-Cambria County) sent a letter</a> to the chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, asking the company to scout Cambria County as a location for a new cracker plant. In his letter, Burns said he wants to &ldquo;make a deal that benefits both ExxonMobil and the hardworking residents of our region.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Fact: Industry will be the only winner if Pennsylvania becomes the next petrochemical hub.</strong> Ask the residents of Port Neches, Texas about the benefits of the petrochemical industry. A chemical plant there <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-chemical-plant-blasts-50000-people-allowed-back-home-2019-11-30/"">exploded before Thanksgiving</a>, displacing 50,000 residents after a four-mile evacuation radius was implemented. That incident was only the latest in a series of mishaps and accidents in the region of the Gulf Coast <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cancer-alley-reserve-louisiana-denka-plant-health-risk-higher-national-average-2019-07-24/"">known as &ldquo;Cancer Alley.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>The health impacts of the Shell cracker plant alone are enough to warrant deep concerns: the plant will emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, which is equivalent to putting nearly a half million more cars on local roads annually. It will also emit three times as much pollution as the Clairton Coke Works, which is Allegheny County&rsquo;s largest source of pollution. Allegheny County already has <a href=""https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/msas/pittsburgh-new-castle-weirton-pa-oh-wv.html#pm24"">some of the worst air quality in the country</a>, and has previously ranked <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/plastics-appalachia-next-cancer-alley-fracking-public-health-ethane"">in the top 2 percent for cancer risks</a> from air pollution. Shell&rsquo;s plant alone will erase 30 years of improved air quality.</p>

<p>If Rep. Burns wants Pennsylvania to be the next petrochemical cluster, he should look at the health impacts of Cancer Alley, a place where <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/louisiana-cancer-alley-getting-more-toxic-905534/"">7 of the 10 census tracts with the highest cancer risks</a> in the country are located. In addition, Louisiana residents <a href=""https://law.tulane.edu/sites/law.tulane.edu/files/files/Cancer%20Fact%20Sheet%202019%20FINAL.pdf"">have a 15 percent higher cancer death rate</a> compared to the rest of the country.</p>

<p>Communities in Burns&rsquo; district are still reeling from the environmental degradation wrought by the coal and steel industries. It would be an insult to injury to allow their health and communities to be further defiled by petrochemicals.</p>

Legislators say Gov. Wolf lacks the authority to have Pennsylvania join RGGI. This is why they’re wrong.,11/22/2019,"<p>Earlier this week, a group of state legislators held a press conference in Harrisburg to unveil new legislation that challenges Gov. Tom Wolf&rsquo;s authority to enter into a partnership like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).</p>

<p>These bills&mdash;Senate Bill 950 and House Bill 2025&mdash;make the outlandish claim that &ldquo;no statutory or constitutional authority currently exists that authorizes a State agency to regulate or impose a tax on carbon dioxide emissions.&rdquo; This is simply wrong and misleading.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Constitution is clear saying that our &ldquo;public natural resources are the common property of all the people&rdquo; and that the Commonwealth act as trustee to &ldquo;conserve and maintain&rdquo; those resources. The real constitutional question is not whether the Commonwealth may act, but how any legislator could justify that allowing polluting industries to dump their waste products into our air for free is in keeping with their duty to conserve natural resources for our benefit.</p>

<p>There is also explicit statutory authority to regulate carbon pollution. The Air Pollution Control Act (APCA) gives the Environmental Quality Board&mdash;the organization that promulgates environmental regulations in Pennsylvania&mdash;the power and the duty to &ldquo;[e]stablish and publish maximum quantities of air contaminants that may be permitted under various conditions at the point of use from any air contaminant source in various areas of the Commonwealth so as to control air pollution.&rdquo; That is, essentially, what Governor Wolf&rsquo;s Executive order requires. The fact that the rule will have a market-based component allows more flexibility for the regulated community, lowers compliance costs, and can generate revenue that can be invested in complementary programs, but the core of the program is a cap on carbon emissions.</p>

<p>Attempts to characterize compliance costs as a tax versus a fee is a strawman argument when, in reality, Governor Wolf&rsquo;s Executive Order doesn&rsquo;t expressly require either. The executive order only says that the proposed regulation will &ldquo;provide for the annual or more frequent auction of carbon dioxide emissions allowances through a market-based mechanism&rdquo; and that such allowances &ldquo;may be traded with holders of allowances from other states.&rdquo; The legislature could pass bills allowing for more options in how any auction revenue is expended, but even without legislation the DEP has the ability to collect emission fees and use them for certain purposes.</p>

<p>These bills are equally outlandish when they say &ldquo;no statute...authorizes the [administration] to adopt regulations, implement a policy or take any other action to authorize the Commonwealth to join or participate in a State or regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program.&rdquo; In fact, APCA clearly states that the Department of Environmental Protection may &ldquo;[c]ooperate with the appropriate agencies of the United States or of other states or any interstate agencies with respect to the control, prevention, abatement and reduction of air pollution,&rdquo; and this would be the latest of several cap-and-trade systems the DEP has implemented.</p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Protection has used market-based programs to control emissions a number of times, and we expect that experience will be reflected in their proposed regulation. &#8203;The Legislature attempting to delay the process with this legislation serves no purpose but to increase pollution.</p>

A Trip to the Supreme Court,11/13/2019,"<p>Until last week, I had never been to the Supreme Court of the United States. But an issue that I have been interested in for years had wound its way through the lower courts and was being heard in the highest court in our land, and I wanted to hear it. So, the evening before the argument, I took a train from our Philadelphia offices to Washington, D.C., had an enjoyable evening with family, and went to bed with my alarm clock set for 5:15 a.m.</p>

<p>I got up in the morning, put on my suit, and headed to the Supreme Court arriving by 5:45 a.m. Even then, I was 80th in line! As it gradually got lighter and the morning joggers ran past, the line grew longer and longer. A little before 9 a.m., the first fifty people in line were let into the building and the rest of us remained waiting outside. If no one else was leaving, I wasn&rsquo;t either. At 9:45 a.m., a few more people were allowed in, and ten minutes later a few more. I was now close to the head of the line&mdash;two, maybe three people in front of me.</p>

<p>Then, we were told there were no more seats. The disappointment was frustrating, but we were told if we still wanted to go inside, we could enter for three minutes. After waiting for over four hours, I was going into the court, even if just for three minutes. We passed through security, locked our coats and bags in a locker, went through more security and waited outside the doors to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Then, one of the marshals said: &ldquo;We have some extra seats, do you want to stay for the whole argument?&rdquo; Of course I did! And just like that, I was in.</p>

<p>The case I heard was <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/18-260.html""><em>County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund</em></a>, in which the Court seeks to answer the question of whether the Clean Water Act requires a permit when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters by a nonpoint source, such as groundwater. Generally, the Clean Water Act requires a permit for the addition to the nation&rsquo;s waters of any pollutant that comes &ldquo;from any point source.&rdquo; The statute defines a point source broadly including &ldquo;any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance.&rdquo; Over the years, what constitutes a pollutant, a point source, and navigable waters have been the subjects of substantial litigation. This was a case I&rsquo;d been waiting for since it was first filed seven years ago.</p>

<p>In this case, the County of Maui injects its treated wastewater from its sewage treatment plant underground into wells, which flows into the groundwater under the facility. The wastewater then travels through the groundwater to the Pacific Ocean a half-mile away. The County of Maui has never had a Clean Water Act permit for its discharges, although it has always known that pollutants from its wells reach the ocean. It has understood that it was subject to the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s nonpoint source management program, which is largely left to the states to implement.</p>

<p>Several environmental groups alleged in a citizen suit that the County&rsquo;s unpermitted discharges of pollutants violated the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s prohibition of polluting without a permit. The U.S District Court for the District of Hawaii agreed. Interestingly, the court found that both the wells that &ldquo;indirectly discharge a pollutant into the ocean through a groundwater conduit&rdquo; as well as the groundwater itself were point sources.</p>

<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed the lower court&rsquo;s decision, holding that a permit was required because the &ldquo;pollutants are fairly traceable from the point source to a navigable water such that the discharge is the functional equivalent of a discharge into the navigable water&rdquo; and &ldquo;the pollutant levels reaching navigable water are more thande minimis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When this case was argued in front of the Supreme Court last week, everyone seemed to realize just how much was on the line. Both sides warned of the extreme consequences should the Supreme Court rule against them. The County of Maui arguedthat a ruling that its discharges require a permit may subject millions of pollutant sources across the country (potentially even small individual households) to the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s permitting requirement for the first time.</p>

<p>Conversely, the environmental groups argued that finding that intervening groundwater eliminates Clean Water Act point source liability would allow polluters to construct a &ldquo;work around&rdquo; to Clean Water Act permitting by directing their pipes into groundwater or cutting off the pipes just a few feet inland of a navigable water. The Supreme Court Justices really seemed to understand both the facts of the case and the potential real-life implications of their decision. They sought, as Justice Breyer said, &ldquo;a standard that will prevent evasion . . . and at the same time doesn&rsquo;t . . . undercut the groundwater program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With all this, I am glad to live in a state that requires permits for discharges of pollutants regardless of whether it is to surface water or groundwater. Under the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, &ldquo;waters of the Commonwealth&rdquo; covers both surface and groundwaters, such that polluters don&rsquo;t have the option to evade permitting by discharging to groundwater or cutting a pipe short of discharging to waters of the Commonwealth. Ensuring these permits protect our natural resources and are enforced is what we do at PennFuture.</p>

Making Sense of Pennsylvania’s Growing Debate Around Petrochemicals,11/12/2019,"<p>When Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto <a href=""https://www.publicsource.org/peduto-speaks-out-publicly-for-the-first-time-against-a-petrochemical-expansion-in-western-pennsylvania/"">announced his opposition</a> late last month to any more petrochemical companies in western Pennsylvania at the Climate Action Summit, I might have been the second person in the audience to rise up and out of my chair to applaud in appreciation and agreement. Advocates and constituents alike have been yearning for an elected leader to call attention to a growing problem: Pennsylvania&rsquo;s proposed petrochemical buildout is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and bad for our communities.</p>

<p>Mayor Peduto followed his statement of opposition with powerful food for thought: Who was at the table&mdash;and who was not&mdash;when decisions were being made to lay the groundwork for the Royal Dutch Shell cracker plant in Beaver County? Who&rsquo;s at the table on <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/post/report-exxonmobil-scouting-property-2nd-cracker-plant-beaver-county#stream/0"">where Exxon will build</a> a second plant? Where the industry wants to build a plant in northeast Pennsylvania? Mayor Peduto makes an important suggestion: the region (and in our opinion the state) should reopen its planning for a massive buildout of a three-state Appalachian Petrochemical Storage Hub, and that those plans be the subject to a much more inclusive regional, state, and public dialogue. Otherwise, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s politicians and business leaders are taking the state down a troubling economic and environmental path with little to no discussion.</p>

<p><u>Questioning PennsylvaniasPetrochemical Buildout is Leadership Against Doublespeak</u></p>

<p>Mayor Peduto&rsquo;s comments show significant leadership. Consider alone the transit of air, water, <a href=""https://www.wtae.com/article/investigation-cracker-plant-will-bring-jobs-pollution/27424034"">and climate pollution</a> that will emanate from the cracker plant. The suggestion becomes even more relevant in light of increasing expressions of concern <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2016/12/12/On-the-fenceline-and-on-the-fence-about-Shell-cracker-plant-pennsylvania-beaver-county/stories/201612120024"">from the frontline communities</a> and families that have been impacted by failing pipeline construction and property value impacts. Rural and urban residents alike simply want a future and livelihood that doesn&rsquo;t come with an unhealthy and fouled environmental price.</p>

<p>Plenty of voters support Mayor Peduto&rsquo;s stance, but his statements were met with outrage and opposition from politicians and industry cheerleaders who lack the courage to buck the will and dominance of the so-called fracked gas and petrochemical industries. There is a disturbing refusal among many elected officials and captains of industry to embrace the changes needed to address climate change and the sustainable industries, jobs, and profits that will grow out of it. Fracked gas and petrochemicals will not be major economic players of a climate-stabilizing future, yet the region and state stubbornly lean into climate-killing industries in a way that is not only intellectually dishonest, but also funnels billions in taxpayer subsidies to help the shareholders and CEO&rsquo;s of petrochemical companies make a profit.</p>

<p>There is a pervasive problem in Pennsylvania: our elected leaders talk out of both sides of their mouths. Self-identified, climate-aware leaders like Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and Governor Tom Wolf repeatedly say that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fracked gas can be extracted and exploitedsafely. On Nov. 12, <a href=""https://kdkaradio.radio.com/media/audio-channel/future-energy-and-shell-cracker-plantnew-voting-laws-governor-pennsylvania-tom"">Wolf gave an interview</a> in which he publicly disagreed with Peduto&rsquo;s stance and said Shell&rsquo;s cracker plant is part of an &ldquo;energy efficient future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wolf and others follow these statements with a belief that Pennsylvania can also be part of the climate solution. There is a mountain of science, models, and experts that say otherwise. It&rsquo;s the work of organizations like PennFuture to expose the duality of these views and <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fallacy-Fiction-and-Falsehoods"">get the facts out about the fallacies</a> behind them, and help the public unravel these confusing statements.</p>

<p><u>The Petrochemical Buildout is a Statewide Problem</u></p>

<p>Heading up a statewide environmental advocacy organization requires that I keep an eye on the whole of our state. As such, I feel it is important to notethat the attempt to elevate Pennsylvania as a world petrochemical power is not just confined to western Pennsylvania. It&rsquo;s intricately connected to pipelines in the southern tier counties, petrochemical projects in northeast Pennsylvania, existing plastics manufacturers in Erie, and along the Susquehanna River, among other existing infrastructure.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this large scale buildout has flown under the radar. So much of the fracked gas and petrochemical industry&rsquo;s success depends on cultivating elected officials with campaign contributions and other goodies. The industry relies on its access to elected officials to get preferential treatment without the complication of public debate. The industries rely on public relations machines to hammer opposing viewpoints, like that of Mayor Peduto, at a moment&rsquo;s notice. This machine churns out messaging packaged for ease of use by the petrochemical industrys surrogates in government and powerful economic development circles.</p>

<p>I fear the spread of petrochemicals in Pennsylvania is becoming unstoppable. Projects are pervasive. Along the Susquehanna River, New Fortress Energy is <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/About/Regional/North-central-Regional-Office/Community-Information/Pages/New-Fortress-Energy.aspx"">constructing a Liquefied Natural Gas facility</a> in Wyalusing, Bradford County.Caithness Energy cut ribbon on its gas fired power plant in Salem Township&mdash;the Moxie Freedom Generating Plant&mdash;along the river in Luzerne County. Elsewhere, the only compressor station along the PennEast Pipeline is moving ahead in Kidder Township, Carbon County, in close proximity the Pocono&rsquo;s Hickory Run State Park and tributaries to the Lehigh River.</p>

<p>With the help of elected officials, the gas industry is loosening the ground for another possible fracked gas and petrochemical hub in Northeast Pennsylvania. Reminiscent of the exclusionary conversations suggested by Mayor Peduto, <a href=""http://www.thinkaboutbriefing.com/"">a closed door meeting</a> of business leaders (Cabot Oil &amp; Gas, CAN DO, Greater Hazleton Chamber of Commerce, Northeast Pennsylvania Manufacturers and Employers Association, UGI Energy Services) and elected officials (Sen. John Yudichak, Speaker Mike Turzai, Rep. Aaron Kaufer, and Rep. Tara Toohil) recently held in Luzerne County mulling over a wish list of site specifications, subsidies, and regulatory rollbacks that would be needed for Northeast Pennsylvania to become home to another cracker plant like Royal Dutch Shell&rsquo;s 900-acre industrial behemoth in Beaver County.</p>

<p>Shortly after the meeting, Sen. Yudichak <a href=""https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/opinion/2019/11/to-help-working-class-democrats-must-recognize-value-of-low-cost-energy-opinion.html"">published an </a><a href=""http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/opinion/2019/11/to-help-working-class-democrats-must-recognize-value-of-low-cost-energy-opinion.html"">op-ed</a>aimed at sowing confusion, arguing that building out more fracked gas and petrochemical infrastructure is the right thing to do for the environment and electricity reliability. While carbon pollution from the electric generation sector has reduced slightly because gas has replaced coal, that trend will not continue. As the few large coal-fired power plants left in Pennsylvania rapidly approach retirement, we are now seeing most of the pollution come from gas plants. That is bad today, but in a few short years we could see more than 70 percent of our generation coming from gas. That not only means much more pollution, but putting all our eggs in one basket is terrible for reliability. Worse yet, gas plants are dependent on the relatively fragile infrastructure of our pipeline system and, when disruptions inevitably happen, municipal gas systems will have a higher priority to receive fuel.</p>

<p><u>Pennsylvania Needs Leadership, Not Lackeys</u></p>

<p>Elected officials and business leaders have the right to their opinions, but as they govern and lead, they owe the people a level playing field, and they owe others with differing viewpoints respect. They do not have the right to negotiate an unsustainable future behind closed doors, spread misinformation and toe industry lines, or be close-minded to alternative and diversified economic development like that being embraced in our neighboring states. They also don&rsquo;t have the right to misdirect, misinform, and confuse what little direction they&rsquo;re providing their constituents at a crucial moment in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economic history. The decisions made in the ensuing years will dictate the next 50 years of environmental outcomes. Our leaders shouldn&rsquo;t take that so lightly and without deference to facts, science, and community impacts.</p>

These blogs will provide an easily digestible point/counterpoint to some of the most prominent statements, quotes, and attacks.</em></p>

<p><strong><u>Introduction and Context</u></strong></p>

<p>Speaking at the Climate Action Summit in downtown Pittsburgh on Oct. 30, 2019, <a href=""https://www.nextpittsburgh.com/features/i-oppose-any-additional-petrochemical-companies-heres-what-mayor-peduto-said-at-the-climate-action-summit/"">Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto announced</a> he would not support any further petrochemical development in western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The mayor&rsquo;s comments surprised environmentalists and industry supporters alike, albeit for different reasons. In the hours that followed his remarks, Peduto was subjected to harsh criticisms and attacks from those who have a very different vision for the future of western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that emotions are running so high. What&rsquo;s at stake is no less than the very future of millions of people. Pennsylvania is already home to one ethane cracker plant and could soon be home to another, as it was announced earlier this month that <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/post/report-exxonmobil-scouting-property-2nd-cracker-plant-beaver-county#stream/0"">ExxonMobil is scouting for land in the area.</a> The next few months and years will shape the landscape &ndash; both economic and geographic &ndash; for decades to come.</p>

<p>Some of the statements issued last week in opposition to the mayors remarksare at best ignorant and, at worst, intentionally false.</p>

<p><strong>Point: Building out natural gas and petrochemicals provides Pennsylvania both economic growth and a clean environment.</strong> David Spigelmyer, the president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, stated that &ldquo;clean and abundant American natural gas is enabling economic growth or environmental progress for every single Pennsylvanian.&rdquo; He went on to say that some politicians &ldquo;push extreme or fringe bans on responsible energy development.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint: Neither gas or petrochemicals is clean, rather both are and can make profound impacts on our environment.</strong> Pointing out their impacts is neither extreme or fringe. It is disingenuous to suggest there is anything &ldquo;clean&rdquo; about natural gas. Nothing about the extraction process&mdash;fracking, spills and leaks&mdash;is <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/natural-gas-carbon-pollution-climate-change-20190708.html"">clean or sustainable for our communities or our environment</a>, and the methane that leaks during natural gas development and processing is <a href=""https://blogs.princeton.edu/research/2014/03/26/a-more-potent-greenhouse-gas-than-co2-methane-emissions-will-leap-as-earth-warms-nature/"">30 times more potent as a greenhouse gas</a> than carbon dioxide. Methane is <a href=""https://unfccc.int/news/new-methane-signs-underline-urgency-to-reverse-emissions"">one of the major contributors</a> to climate change.</p>

<p>A final point on Spigelmyer&rsquo;s statement: there is nothing &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; or &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; about standing up and fighting for clean air and clean water. Pennsylvanians have a constitutional right to both and western Pennsylvania has a long history of environmental damage borne from industry. The mayor&rsquo;s comments reflect on this history and the public health and environmental damage caused by the coal and steel industry. It&rsquo;s fair to question allowing another well known polluting industry access to the region, particularly after <a href=""http://cleanair.org/wp-content/uploads/HIA-Final.pdf"">decades of progress in cleaning up our air</a> and water.</p>

<p><strong>Point: Anyone who opposes the petrochemical buildout also opposes economic growth and new jobs for the region.</strong> Rep. Mike Turzai, who represents a portion of Allegheny County and serves as the speaker of the House of Representatives, said in a statement posted online Wednesday that Peduto&rsquo;s comments represent an &ldquo;anti-growth mindset that is both irresponsible and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint: Opposing petrochemicals is not an &quot;anti-growth mindset.&quot; It is a pro-public health mindset that puts the health of an entire region ahead of profits for global companies like Shell.</strong> In one sentence, Turzai calls the mayor&rsquo;s comments irresponsible and dangerous, but then turns around and supports turning western Pennsylvania <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/plastics-appalachia-next-cancer-alley-fracking-public-health-ethane"">into the next Cancer Alley.</a> Again, there is nothing irresponsible about supporting clean air and clean water.</p>

<p><strong>Point: The region doesnt have to choose between good jobs and clean air and water.</strong> Darrin Kelly, the president of the Allegheny/Fayette Central Labor Council, issued a statement saying &ldquo;it just isn&rsquo;t true that we have to choose between good jobs and clean air and water.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint: It&rsquo;s a false narrative that the petrochemical industry provides both good jobs and clean air and water</strong>. While there are many ways to advance <a href=""https://pittsburghgreenstory.com/pennsylvania-clean-jobs-report-details-states-growing-clean-energy-sector/"">both economic development and environmental progress</a>, the petrochemical has no history of doing so. The Shell cracker plant <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/energy-environment/plastics-shell-pennsylvania-plant.html"">will emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year</a>, the equivalent of about 480,000 extra cars on our roads. It will also release <a href=""https://breatheproject.org/patrolling-our-air/"">more than 30 tons per year of hazardous air pollutants</a> like benzene, which is linked to cancer and childhood leukemia, and particulate matter linked to lung and bladder cancers.</p>

<p>Western Pennsylvania already has <a href=""https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/states/pennsylvania/"">some of the worst air quality in the entire country.</a> If someone staunchly and unapologetically supports Shell&rsquo;s petrochemical plant, and is also hopeful for more cracker plants to come, then that person is making a tradeoff that includes sacrificing public health for jobs. It&rsquo;s that cut and dried.</p>

<p>Peduto, unlike his critics, seems not to have forgotten <a href=""https://conserveland.org/blog/article-i-section-27-of-the-pennsylvania-constitution/"">Article 1, Section 27 of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s constitution</a>:</p>

PennFuture organizes tour of Philadelphia green stormwater infrastructure sites,10/30/2019,"<p>Often times, showing is better than telling. That&rsquo;s why PennFuture last month organized a bus tour in an effort to highlight the social, economic and environmental benefits of green stormwater infrastructure in Philadelphia. </p>

<p>In addition to presenting an opportunity to discuss the many benefits of green stormwater infrastructure, the bus tour also allowed for a discussion about the challenges that come with aligning and integrating various city programs and initiatives.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s bus tour attracted prominent officials and business leaders from the city, including Philadelphia city Councilwoman Maria Qui&ntilde;ones-S&aacute;nchez, a staff member from her office, as well as experts andpartners at Meliora Designs, Roofmeadow, Rodriguez Consulting LLC., and the Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Our first stop was to visit the <a href=""http://www.americanstimprovementproject.com/"" target=""_blank"">American Street Improvement Project</a> starting at Jefferson Street. American Street was once an industrial corridor, spurred by the Reading and Philadelphia Railroads that were routed through the area. The commercial strip was filled with factories, repair shops, and freight yards. Beginning in the late 1800s, this corridor produced tens of thousands of jobs for the region. But for the last several decades, the post-industrial corridor has been significantly blighted. </p>

<p>The two-mile long corridor is currently being reconstructed to integrate the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;Complete Streets&rdquo; vision&mdash;which ensures that city streets accommodate all users of transportation whether pedestrians, bicyclists, public transit users, or motor vehicles&mdash;with the Philadelphia Water Department&rsquo;s Green City, Clean Waters initiative that is constructing green stormwater infrastructure to manage stormwater runoff.</p>

<p>The final design incorporates 42 green stormwater infrastructure systems including rain gardens, bioswales, subsurface stormwater trenches, and tree pits. Each time it rains, GSI systems will collect more than 1.4 million gallons of stormwater runoff from the right-of-way, which will equate to more than 50 greened acres towards PWD&rsquo;s program for waterway pollutant reduction.</p>

<p>Funding for the project was made possible through partnerships with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, United States Department of Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery Discretionary Grants Program, and Philadelphia Water Department green stormwater infrastructure funds.</p>

<p>The American Street Improvement project is a unique approach to green stormwater infrastructure design and construction. The project design required extensive community outreach and engagement to ensure that the corridor was accessible to all stakeholders. Councilwoman Qui&ntilde;ones-S&aacute;nchez&rsquo;s office has been a leader in ensuring all stakeholder priorities are incorporated into the project design. During the tour she acknowledged that at the end of the day, no one stakeholder received everything they asked for.</p>

<p>Our second stop was the Shissler Recreation Center, a portion of Kensington&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.sustainable19125and19134.org/about-us/big-green-block"" target=""_blank"">Big Green Block</a>. The block was a collaboration of public, private and non-profit partners to turn a 20-acre blighted piece of vacant land strewn with trash and cinders into new green space. Councilwoman Qui&ntilde;ones-S&aacute;nchez is a strong supporter of the Shissler Recreation Center and lauded the success of the park. We were joined by Andrew Goodman from the New Kensington Community Development Corporation who shared with us the story of the Big Green Block and what it took to make the project possible. NKCDC continues to maintain the green stormwater infrastructure through the Soak it up! Adoption program.</p>

<p>The block includes the Shissler Recreation center, the Kensington High School for the Creative and Performing Arts, a spray park, Palmer Doggie Depot dog park, and Stan &ldquo;The Cutman&rdquo; Field for kids. Rain gardens, percolating astroturf, embedded planters, and a basketball court with underground stormwater runoff collection chambers are incorporated into this green space to capture 95 percentof the blocks&rsquo; stormwater run-off on site. The Big Green Block project began in 2008 and was made possible through partnerships with local residents, the New Kensington Community Development Corporation, the Philadelphia Water Department, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Sustainability, the Mural Arts Program, Philadelphia Parks &amp; Recreation, and the Philadelphia School District.</p>

<p>During the return drive to our ending destination, the partners had an opportunity to discuss with Councilwoman Qui&ntilde;ones-S&aacute;nchez the challenges they are facing with incorporating green stormwater infrastructure into designs for the <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Opportunity-for-Green-Stormwater-Infrastructure-in-Philadelphias-Rebuild-Initiative"" target=""_blank"">Rebuild Initiative&rsquo;s</a> investments in the city&rsquo;s parks, recreation centers, playgrounds, and libraries. The <a href=""https://worldlandscapearchitect.com/waterloo-rebosante-philadelphia-usa-roofmeadow/#.XbnaVuhKhPZ"" target=""_blank"">Waterloo Recreation Center</a> is one of those sites receiving investments from the Rebuild Initiative, that is also slated to receive green stormwater infrastructure investments. Initially planned to be completed in late 2017, the project has run into delays in moving forward at the city level.</p>

<p>As part of PennFuture&rsquo;s work to elevate the importance of green stormwater infrastructure in Philadelphia with elected leaders and community residents, we are developing city council champions to advocate for a strong program. Philly green stormwater infrastructure bus tours are one way we are engaging with city council members around this important issue for the people of Philadelphia.</p>

PennFuture delivers Toxic Neighbor petition to U.S. Steel,10/28/2019,"<p>The steel industry has long played an important role in western Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy, but it is impossible to ignore its equally long and harmful history of pollution. In Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 21st century innovation economy, there are no excuses for giving job-creating industries like steel a free pass for polluting our air and water. Pennsylvanians can and should have steel jobs and clean air, but it takes investment, good public policy, and corporate responsibility.</p>

<p>In 2017, PennFuture launched its first &ldquo;Toxic Neighbor&rdquo; campaign with a firm belief that profits shouldn&rsquo;t take priority over people&rsquo;s health and their rights to clean air and clean water, as laid out in Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The campaign was especially important because PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team had documented more than 6,700 air emission violations at U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Clairton Coke Works from January 2012 and May 2015. On average, this is more than five air quality emission violations each day.</p>

<p>Initially, our Toxic Neighbor campaign asked residents to send letters to Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, demanding he take action to protect our region&rsquo;s air quality. More than 300 people sent letters to Fitzgerald, increasing the public pressure on the Allegheny County Health Department to ensure that it held U.S. Steel accountable.</p>

<p>The second iteration of our Toxic Neighbor campaign began earlier this year after a fire ripped through U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Clairton Coke Works, knocking out the pollution control systems that remove sulfur dioxide from emissions for almost four months, exposing surrounding neighborhoods to harmful chemicals.</p>

<p>At the heart of the campaign was our petition to U.S. Steel, demanding the company do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Retire Clairton Coke Works&rsquo; oldest, dirtiest and most problematic coke batteries - batteries 1, 2 and 3;</li>
	<li>Modernize Clairton Coke Works by investing in technologically advanced upgrades to ensure cleaner air and Mon Valley jobs, now and in the future; and</li>
	<li>Commit to the community and regulators that it will be more transparent about plant operations, especially in times of emergency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, PennFuture is proud to announce the petition was delivered to U.S. Steel President and Chief Executive Officer David Burritt. We made it clear in a letter to Burritt that this petition represents the collective voices of more than 5,300 people who demand clean air, healthy communities, and a commitment to public safety by U.S. Steel.</p>

<p>PennFuture started this petition to amplify voices across western Pennsylvania that were demanding cleaner air and healthier communities. Residents in Clairton and across the region are tired of pollution, accidents and lack of transparency from U.S. Steel. These are the voices of people who live and work here. They can no longer be ignored by U.S. Steel.</p>

<p>It is our hope that Burritt will take residents&rsquo; concerns seriously as he leads U.S. Steel into a new decade, and that under his leadership, U.S. Steel and its employees can prosper without harming residents&rsquo; health and the environment.</p>

<p>PennFuture wants to sincerely thank everyone who took the time to sign this petition, and for everyone who continues to advocate for clean air in the Mon Valley and Greater Pittsburgh region. If we speak loud enough, those in power will have no choice but to hear our demands.</p>

<p>Though this phase of Toxic Neighbor has ended, it will not be the end of our efforts to hold U.S. Steel and other polluters accountable. Stay tuned to see what&rsquo;s next as PennFuture continues the fight for clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment.</p>

So Pennsylvania Might Join RGGI. What Comes Next?,10/10/2019,"<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-83f5811c-7fff-ea54-19a0-1e2393e3ccc6""></span></p>

<p>On Oct. 3rd, Governor Tom Wolf signed <a href=""https://www.oa.pa.gov/Policies/eo/Documents/2019-07.pdf"">Executive Order 2019-07</a> instructing the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) &ldquo;to begin the process of developing a carbon budget and trading program that aligns with that of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).&rdquo; So what exactly does that mean?</p>

<p>It involves creating a cap-and-trade program where to emit one ton of carbon dioxide, a generator will need to hold an &ldquo;allowance.&rdquo; These allowances are created by the state and together they make the emissions cap. Generators who emit CO2 will need to buy the allowances they need at an auction, letting the market set the price. Revenue from that auction can be invested in different ways&mdash;ideally in things like more clean renewable energy and energy efficiency, but the state could fund other priorities or programs.</p>

<p><u><strong>What Kind of RGGI Program Can DEP Propose?</strong></u></p>

<p>The executive order requires the DEP proposal to be &ldquo;sufficiently consistent with the <a href=""https://www.rggi.org/sites/default/files/Uploads/Design-Archive/Model-Rule/2017-Program-Review-Update/2017_Model_Rule_revised.pdf"">RGGI Model Rule</a> such that allowances may be traded with holders of allowances from other states.&rdquo; That suggests that the affected sources will be defined the same way (i.e. electric generators with a nameplate capacity over 25 megawatts), the pool of available allowances will be sized so as not to disrupt the functioning of the market, and that the various compliance periods and accounting procedures will align. Beyond that basic structure, the DEP will have a lot of flexibility.</p>

<p>One issue where we expect debate is related to the allocation of allowances. Every source of fossil fuel generation will likely try and make the case why they are a special case deserving of free or low-cost allowances. The waste coal industry in particular has had some success making these kinds of arguments in the past, so that is a particular industry to watch. Other states also choose to hold some allowances in reserve for special purposes. For instance, Massacusets holds some allowances aside to retire when people voluntarily purchase clean energy.</p>

<p>Early projections suggest there could be $300 to $400 million per year in revenue&mdash;who gets to spend the money and what it gets spent on will be another significant issue. DEP can use money from air emissions fees to support the operation of the air program itself, and the Governor&rsquo;s remarks indicate they are at least considering other spending priorities. It&rsquo;s also clear that the Legislature will have significant input into how the money is spent.</p>

<p>While the Executive Order is an important and historic step toward reducing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s carbon pollution, it is just the beginning of a potentially long pathway that, even if all goes smoothly, could take 18 to 24 months to finalize. So, what comes next? The answer to that question requires some explanation.</p>

<p><u><strong>So What Comes Next?</strong></u></p>

<p>The Regulatory Review Act (RRA) specifies a <a href=""http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/resources/docs/Regulatory_Review_Process_Manual.pdf"">detailed process</a> the DEP needs to follow to promulgate a regulation, but the actual work usually begins several months before this formal process starts, and working towards RGGI is no different.</p>

<p>Before any RGGI language is drafted, the technical and legal staff at DEP will spend a good bit of time researching issues like the ones we mentioned above and will form ideas on how they might move forward. While there are very few requirements at this early stage, DEP tends to start by developing a powerpoint presentation covering the conceptsin the regulation, and presenting that to the various relevant advisory committees.</p>

<p>In this case, we expect presentations will be given, at a minimum, to the Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee, the Climate Change Advisory Committee, and the Citizens Advisory Council, but there may also be additional presentations to other committees or groups. The DEP will also likely meet with members of the regulated community, such as power plant owners, and other interested parties to discuss RGGI concepts before the drafting process begins. And, in some cases, the DEP might also hold &ldquo;listening sessions&rdquo; or other events to get even more public input.</p>

<p><u><em>The ProposalStage</em></u></p>

<p>Once the DEP feels they have the necessary information and analysis, they will write a preamble to the regulation, the regulatory language itself (called &ldquo;Annex A&rdquo;), and prepare a Regulatory Analysis Form, all of which will be presented at a meeting of the Environmental Quality Board (EQB). The EQB, if they vote to do so, will formally propose to adopt the rulemaking. We expect this will take place around July.</p>

<p>Next, the DEP will prepare a package on the proposed rulemaking and have it delivered to the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) for publication in the <a href=""https://www.pabulletin.com"">Pennsylvania Bulletin</a>. At the same time the package goes to the LRB, it will also be delivered to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) and to the relevant standing committees in the House and Senate. Normally DEP regulations are sent to the House and Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committees.</p>

<p>About 10 days after the package is delivered to the LRB, it will appear in the Bulletin. This notice will mark the start of the formal public comment period (which must be at least 30 days) and it will also have information about any public hearings that are scheduled. Anyone interested in the regulation can file written comments and/or testify at a public hearing, and all of their comments will become part of the official record. The DEP will likely also schedule presentations for the relevant advisory committees and give them an opportunity to weigh in on the proposal. After the public comment period closes, IRRC will have 30 more days to submit their comments and the legislative committees may file comments at any time prior to the delivery of a final form regulation.</p>

<p>After the close of the comment period, there will appear to be a lull in the process, but a lot of work will be going on behind the scenes. DEP staff will review each and every comment they receiveand make any changes they think are necessary to the draft rule. They will also prepare a &ldquo;Comment Response Document&rdquo; that explains how they handled every comment. Changes at this point are usually either clarifications or relatively minor fixes to the language, but occasionally big changes are necessary that will require DEP to reopen the comment period.</p>

<p><u><em>Final-form Rulemaking</em></u></p>

<p>Once DEP is ready with a final rule, it will be presented once again to the EQB and, assuming it is approved, it will once again be delivered to IRRC and the standing committees in the Legislature along with all of the comments that DEP received. This delivery needs to happen within two years of the date the rule was proposed, estimated to be July 2022. If it is not, the rulemaking ends and DEP needs to start again from the beginning.</p>

<p>Once the rule is delivered, IRRC will schedule it to be considered at their next meeting that is at least 30 days away. The public can submit comments directly to IRRC up to 48 hours before the meeting, and the standing committees can also respond at any time up to 24 hours before the meeting.</p>

<p>If IRRC approves of the rule, the Attorney General gets to review it for legality and form. If all goes well, the rule will be published as final in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.</p>

<p>If IRRC disapproves of the rule, the DEP has 40 days to deliver a report back to IRRC.The DEP can make changes to the rule in response to IRRCs comments, but they are not required to do so. The IRRC will consider the rule again at another meeting and the standing committees will have more time to act, but IRRC cannot stop a rule from continuing toward finalization.</p>

<p><u><strong>What Role does the Legislature Play?</strong></u></p>

<p>The legislative veto is unconstitutional in Pennsylvania so, if the standing committees want to stop a rulemaking, the House and Senate must adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving of the rule and either have that signed by the Governor or override the Governor&rsquo;s veto by a two-thirds majority. Unless that happens, the rule may be delayed, but the process will continue toward finalization.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say the Legislature doesn&rsquo;t have other methods to halt or delay the process. When Pennsylvania was drafting regulations required to fulfill the Clean Power Plan under President Obama, the legislature passed a bill that added significant delay to the above process. <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&amp;SPick=20190&amp;cosponId=30314"">Similar legislation</a> is already proposed in the state House to delay consideration of the RGGI rulemaking. There are also indications that the legislature may try and add additional rules to limit how Pennsylvania can create a RGGI-like program, including requiring that other RGGI states cannot ban the use of natural gas. We expect other new attempts to slow this process down as well.</p>

<p><u><strong>Legal Challenges</strong></u></p>

<p>Outside of the regulatory review process, there is also the possibility that any rulemaking will be challenged in the courts. Although the Governor expressed hope that this process wouldn&rsquo;t become political, the Pennsylvania House Republican caucus quickly <a href=""http://www.pahousegop.com/News/15153/Latest-News/House-Republicans-Urge-Wolf-Not-to-Go-it-Alone---Leadership-responds-to-push-to-join-RGGI-"">issued a statement</a> saying that they &ldquo;believe the executive branch cannot bind the state into multi-state agreements without the approval of the General Assembly.&rdquo; That might signal a pending legal challenge.</p>

<p>While it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising to see a lawsuit filed in fairly short order, courts tend not to weigh in until the administration makes a final action. Since any actual law is likely 18 to 24 months from going into effect, it is much more difficult&mdash;but not impossible&mdash;for potential challengers to show they will suffer harm by allowing the administrative process to continue.</p>

<p>The other more important hurdle a lawsuit would face is that our state&rsquo;s Air Pollution Control Act (APCA) gives the executive branch fairly broad powers to set emission limits and reduce pollution. Programs with interstate trading components are one of many tools the DEP has used to achieve that goal in the past. This includes the Acid Rain Program (1995), the NOx Budget Trading Program (2003), the Clean Air Interstate Rule (2005), and the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (2011). It&rsquo;s not clear how opponents will justify that regulating carbon pollution triggers an exception or is any different than previous efforts to reduce air pollution.</p>

<p>Beyond the Air Pollution Control Act, we also have the Environmental Rights Amendment in Article 1 &sect; 27 of our state Constitution, which states that, &ldquo;The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.&rdquo;Even if the authority in the APCA wasn&rsquo;t specific, it would be hard to justify how ignoring carbon pollution was in keeping with the Commonwealth&rsquo;s trust responsibility to conserve and maintain our natural resources.</p>

<p><u><strong>Conclusion</strong></u></p>

<p>Pennsylvania has an ethical responsibility to be a leader in fighting the climate crisis. We are the fourth-highest carbon polluter in the nation and are still heavily subsidizing fossil fuels. Governor Wolf&rsquo;s executive order is a good and necessary first step to address this imbalance, but no single action is going to solve the problem.</p>

<p>In addition to implementing a cap on carbon pollution, we need to invest in cleaner alternatives to coal and gas instead of creating new subsidies for dirty fossil fuels. We need to extend and expand our Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, increase investment in energy efficiency, and enable new business models like community solar. We also need to ensure the Department of Environmental Protection has the tools it needs to do its job.</p>

<p>Joining RGGI is a great first step, but it cannot be the only step Pennsylvania takes to address the climate crisis. Regardless, PennFuture will keep you posted as the process unfolds over the next 18 to 24 months.</p>

"Exploring Erie, and an Emerging Presence",10/7/2019,"<p>I just returned from an annual field trip we take with PennFuture&rsquo;s board of directors, as well as a terrific group of folks we call our President&rsquo;s Leadership Council. We try to visit special places in Pennsylvania&mdash;there are so many&mdash;and if these places have resonance with our mission, our program or the threats we are addressing, all the better.</p>

<p>This year we visited Erie County.</p>

<p>Erie County has been a part of my worldview from my days working to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s ecological treasures. The county&rsquo;s 77-mile Lake Erie shoreline and ribbon lake watershed contains spectacular biodiversity, natural features, great water-based recreation and rich agriculture. The rest of Erie County&mdash;by my rough estimation 80 percent&mdash;lies in the French Creek watershed, which empties into the Allegheny River and is one of the most ecologically significant tributaries to the Ohio basin, mainly because of aquatic life, freshwater mussels in particular.</p>

<p>My work now lies in defending these waters, lands and communities, and we at PennFuture see threats on the horizon.</p>

<p>One threat to the area is the lack of appreciation the rest of the state has for our northwest corner, Lake Erie and the fact that we are part of the Great Lakes ecosystem and region. The distance between Erie and Harrisburg creates another barrier&mdash;physically, psychologically and politically&mdash;and we know that dynamic can lead to this being an underserved region.</p>

<p>Our portion of Lake Erie has been relatively lucky in avoiding harmful algal blooms. These blooms have the potential to adversely impact our drinking water, and much diligence is required to maintain and improve water quality in light of changing climate and other conditions. Erie remains home to some of the most polluting industries and all have the potential to harm air, water and public health.</p>

<p>PennFuture aspires to play more of a role defending Lake Erie and the region&rsquo;s water, and we are driven to this work by legacy threats such as industrial discharges and leaking septic systems, and other emerging threats. A major concern is Erie&rsquo;s proximity to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s frack fields, its concentration of plastics manufacturing, and the massive petrochemical buildout that can occur there if the community is not attentive to this threat.</p>

<p>Related is the threat of the increasing infiltration of plastics everywhere, including into our freshwater resources, and how we can defend against a gas industry that is intent on exploiting frack gas to exponentially increase production of plastics. PennFuture aspires to shorten the distance between Erie and Harrisburg, and build capacity for the Erie community to have a stronger voice in the halls of the Capitol and be a more integrated part of our statewide water campaigns. </p>

<p>So we made a field trip to Erie to increase awareness among PennFuture&rsquo;s leaders of the beauty of the area. But more important were our meetings with members of the community who are dealing with environmental threats from invasive species to pollution from Erie Coke. These community leaders, elected officials and resource managers are on the ground every day fighting for their rights to clean air and clean water.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s brand of advocacy will add value to these efforts and we look forward to close partnerships in the Erie area in the near future.</p>

A Sunnier Vision for Pennsylvania: An Alternative to Giving Tax Breaks to Fossil Fuels,9/27/2019,"<p>On Sept. 19th, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted to give yet another gift to the already <a href=""/News-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidy-Report"">heavily subsidized natural gas</a> and petrochemical industry: a 20 percent tax break to companies that build petrochemical facilities that turn natural gas to plastics and other products. This archaic vision of economic development in Pennsylvania is a threat to our communities, ecology, and climate. Instead of giving fossil fuels even more subsidy, state policymakers could get more jobs, grid resiliency, and pollution reduction by providing a similar tax credit for utility scale solar instead.</p>

<p><strong>HB 1100: A Windfall for Polluting Petrochemical Projects</strong></p>

<p>HB 1100 is part of the so-called &ldquo;Energize PA&rdquo; package of policies aimed at giving the economic keys of the Commonwealth to the petrochemical industry. It would be more accurate to call the package <a href=""/Files/News/PennFuture-Policy-Memo---EnergizePA---6-7-19DRAFT.pdf"">&ldquo;Fossilize PA&rdquo;</a>, and it says a lot about what is wrong with Pennsylvania politics. Our legislators are still acting like they can ignore climate change and chase the hope of short-term economic rewards through fossil fuel subsidies, at the cost of long-term economic growth and environmental degradation.</p>

<p>While scientists tell us we need to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, this bill gives climate-killing companies a 30-year tax break. The young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg may as well have been talking directly to them when she said at the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/video/climate/100000006732168/greta-thunberg-united-nations.html?action=click&amp;gtype=vhs&amp;version=vhs-heading&amp;module=vhs&amp;region=title-area&amp;cview=true&amp;t=53"">United Nations</a>, &ldquo;all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>HB 1100 is, essentially, an extension of the $1.6 billion tax break the legislature gave Shell to build the ethane cracker plant in Beaver County. Offered to any company that invests $1 billion to construct facilities that utilize Pennsylvania fracked gas, the Department of Revenue estimates that the credit is worth an average of <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/BI/FN/2019/0/HB1100P1593.pdf"">$26.5 million annually per facility</a> through 2050.</p>

<p>This means the taxpayer subsidy could total $795 million dollars per facility, meaning taxpayers could guarantee developers almost 80 percent of their initial investment in tax breaks&mdash;a major windfall for these projects. And, if they don&rsquo;t have enough tax liability on their own, they are allowed to sell the tax credits to someone else. Since this money doesn&rsquo;t show up as an appropriation in the budget, it&rsquo;s also much less likely that the legislature will revisit the subsidy in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a &ldquo;Solarize PA&rdquo; Tax Credit to support Utility-Scale Solar Projects</strong></p>

<p>What would happen if our Legislature took Thunberg seriously and actually tried to develop new, clean energy sources like utility scale solar?</p>

<p>We have <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=1413595&amp;DocName=PENNSYLVANIA%26%2339%3bS%20SOLAR%20FUTURE%20PLAN.PDF%20%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:blue%3b%22%3e%28NEW%29%3c/span%3e"">vast potential for developing projects</a> here in Pennsylvania, and we are seeing some growth, but our weak Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (0.5% solar by 2021) have made it far more attractive for companies to build projects in other states. That&rsquo;s why New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut all have <a href=""https://seia.org/states-map"">much more solar generation</a> than we do.</p>

<p>When Brent Alderfer, CEO of Community Energy, <a href=""https://consumer.pasenategop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2019/05/alderfer-slides.pdf"">testified before the Pennsylvania Senate </a>in May, he said that utility-scale solar was already below one dollar per watt and the prices are expected to continue to fall. Based on a calculator <a href=""https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php"">provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a>, each $1 billion investment at today&rsquo;s prices could build about a gigawatt of solar and generate more than 1.3 million MWh of clean energy per year. That is enough energy to power more than 130,000 Pennsylvania homes.</p>

<p>HB1100 could be redesigned to give the same magnitude of transferable tax credit to solar companies that it currently gives polluters, but without the negative climate and environmental impact. A $26.5 million dollar transferable tax credit per billion dollars of private investment in utility scale solar would equate to almost $20 per megawatt-hour. That would, in effect, be similar to raising the Solar Alternative Energy Credit (also called SREC) price around $20 without directly impacting consumers&rsquo; electric bills. This would encourage a boom of new private investment dollars into the state and significant growth in solar jobs.</p>

<p>The impact on Pennsylvania&rsquo;s climate goals would also be significant. If that new clean energy generation replaces natural gas generation, we would save over half a million tons of carbon pollution per year. Assuming a social cost of carbon of <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5321009/"">$31.2 per ton of CO2 emissions</a>, the carbon reductions alone would have an annual value of more than $31 million dollars&mdash;more than the direct cost of the tax break itself.</p>

<p>A transferable tax credit for utility scale solar would also produce more homegrown jobs. Penn State University <a href=""https://www.lightsourcebp.com/us/penn-state-solar-project/"">recently signed a contract</a>with Lightsource BP to build a 70MW facility. That is, to date, the largest single project in Pennsylvania and it is designed to generate half of Penn State&rsquo;s annual energy demand. That project is projected to result in an additional 250 local jobs. Using that same job-creation rate, a gigawatt of solar projects would create over 3,500 jobs&mdash;three and a half times what HB1100 requires to qualify for the subsidy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, building more solar generation would provide much needed diversity in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s energy grid. Right now most of our generation comes from a mix of nuclear, gas, and coal, but the nuclear and coal plants are rapidly approaching retirement. If we continue to subsidize the gas industry, we will get what we pay for and gas will dominate our electric grid. Having all of our eggs in that basket is a recipe for volatile prices and even blackouts.</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Choice Between Two Futures</strong></p>

<p>What has been stunning about HB 1100 is how little the legislature has debated its efficacy, given how significant a decision it is. Pennsylvania is at a fork in the road&mdash;we can invest in the industries, like solar, that are rapidly growing, future proof, and protective of our environment or we can invest in the industries of yesteryear, with an uncertain future, and harsh polluting realities. There is a better vision for Pennsylvania&mdash;let&rsquo;s turn the 20 percent tax break for polluters into an investment in an industry of the future like utility scale solar. Let&rsquo;s &ldquo;Solarize&rdquo; Pennsylvania instead of &ldquo;Fossilizing&rdquo; it.</p>

Fracking Across Property Lines: Briggs v. Southwestern Energy Production Company,9/13/2019,"<p>Multiyear litigation over unconventional oil and gas development&mdash;specifically, hydraulic fracturing or &ldquo;fracking&rdquo;&mdash;has caused a stir in Pennsylvania courts regarding the interpretation of a long-standing property law rule.</p>

<p>Established in the late 1800s, the &ldquo;rule of capture&rdquo; considers subsurface oil and gas owned only when it is &ldquo;captured&rdquo; or produced from a well. The rule was originally born out of necessity due to the fugitive nature of oil and gas and the complex relationship between neighboring landowners regarding the ownership of shared subsurface oil and gas deposits.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the rule of capture protected the right of property owners to use their land for oil and gas exploration. However, fracking companies have abused the rule, essentially assuming it allowed them to drill a well on its leased property, tap subsurface oil and gas from adjoining properties, and be absolved from legal liability. This legal exploit is exactly how Texas-based Southwestern Energy Company (SWN) extracted natural gas from the Briggs family property in northeast Pennsylvania, and the family argues that this practice constitutes an illegal trespass onto their property.</p>

<p>Stemming from the familys 2015 complaint, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania must now decide whether the rule of capture extends to fracking. In 2017, the trial court extended the meaning of the rule to encompass fracking practices. The trial court&rsquo;s decision effectively halted the Briggses&rsquo; trespass action. On appeal in 2018, the Superior Court reversed the lower court&rsquo;s decision, stating that SWN could be held liable for damages in trespass. The Superior Court refused to recognize the rule of capture as a defense to trespass related to fracking because of the intrusive nature of fracking. SWN appealed the Superior Court&rsquo;s decision, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania granted its petition on November 20, 2018.</p>

<p>On Sept. 12, lawyers from both sides argued the following issue in front of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does the rule of capture apply to oil and gas produced from wells that were completed using hydraulic fracturing and preclude trespass liability for allegedly draining oil or gas from under nearby property, where the well is drilled solely on and beneath the driller&rsquo;s own property and the hydraulic fracturing fluids are injected solely on or beneath the driller&rsquo;s own property?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attorney Robert L. Byer pleaded SWN&rsquo;s case first in front of the Court, and his argument relied heavily on long standing precedent recognizing the rule of capture as precluding trespass liability. When questioned why the injection of fracking proppants (the solid material used to keep fractures open) on to a neighbor&rsquo;s property should not be considered a trespass, Byer deferred to the uncertainty involved in the fracking process.</p>

<p>He stated that the technology does not exist to sufficiently prove that SWN&rsquo;s proppants crossed the property line, entering the Briggs land. Furthermore, when asked to distinguish this practice from slant drilling, which the rule of capture does not absolve trespass liability, Byer stated that slant drilling violates the rule of capture because the driller physically and consciously crossed on to the neighbor&rsquo;s property. Byer concluded that the state Legislature is more fit to solve this issue rather than a &ldquo;retroactive&rdquo; judicial decision.<span baskerville="""" bell="""" class=""qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"" font-size:="""" id=""E330"" is=""qowt-word-run"" new="""" old="""" qowt-eid=""E330"" serif="""" style=""display: inline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: "" times=""""></span></p>

<p>Conversely, Laurence M. Kelly, the Briggs attorney, advocated that the rule of capture does not preclude trespass related to fracking activities. Kelly compared the invasive nature of injecting proppants into a neighboring subsurface to the drill bit used in illegal slant drilling practices. He asserted that SWN consciously and physically injected proppants into the Briggs&rsquo; subsurface property, continuously leaching fuel from their land without consent.</p>

<p>We think this is an important case to watch because if the Court decides in SWN&rsquo;s favor, there could be negative implications for Pennsylvania landowners with subsurface gas and oil at their property&rsquo;s boundary. Oil companies like SWN could shop around, establish a lease with one landowner at the cheapest price, tap the communal oil, and owe no royalties to the neighbor. Contrary to SWN&rsquo;s argument, this will create negative economic impacts as neighboring landowners could be forced into a race to the bottom to establish a lease in order to capitalize on oil beneath their land.</p>

<p>Furthermore, such an interpretation of the rule will necessarily strip the non-leasing landowner of any legal recourse. As the fracking boom continues in many areas of Pennsylvania, the Court&rsquo;s upcoming decision may help to clarify the interplay between the rule of capture and fracking across property lines.<span baskerville="""" bell="""" class=""qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"" font-size:="""" is=""qowt-word-run"" new="""" old="""" qowt-eid=""E330"" serif="""" style=""display: inline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: "" times=""""></span></p>

Philadelphia Energy Solutions' Failures,9/10/2019,"<p>In late August, I traveled to South Philadelphia to testify before Philadelphias <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/programs/refinery-advisory-group/"">Refinery Advisory Group</a>, which was formed by Mayor Jim Kenney to consider how the closure of the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery will affect the city&rsquo;s economy, environment, public health and safety.</p>

<p>My message was simple: dumping money into the petrochemical industry is a dead end for Pennsylvania and we need a better and more sustainable pathway for our future.</p>

<p>Originally owned and operated by Sunoco, the refinery by 2012 was in financial trouble and needed more capital to continue operations. The Carlyle Group put up $175 million and ended up with a two-thirds share of the new company&mdash;PES&mdash;as well as operational control of the 1,300 acre facility. Sunoco, in a separate deal, merged with Energy Transfer Partners around the same time and that company retained the remaining one-third stake. In spite of this deal, and with another $25 million in grants from Pennsylvania taxpayers along with tax benefits and concessions from environmental regulators, PES remained financially troubled.</p>

<p>Phil Rinaldi, the former chief executive officer of PES, often blames the company&rsquo;s financial difficulties on environmental regulations and, particularly, the ethanol mandate that requires refiners to blend in a certain amount of ethanol or purchase credits, known as RINs. Despite the fact that other refineries are able to meet the standard, PES hasn&rsquo;t actually been buying all the RINs it needs for the past few years and they now owe the Environmental Protection Agency more than $350 million worth of credits.</p>

<p>Apparently it&rsquo;s easier to blame the EPA than admit their failure is largely self-inflicted. In 2013, for example, when crude oil prices were more than $90 a barrel, Rinaldi blew through $186 million on a terminal to transport crude by rail, otherwise known as the <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/stories/protecting-your-community-crude-oil-bomb-trains"">oil bomb trains</a>. When oil prices collapsed in 2015, that plan quickly became unprofitable.</p>

<p>In spite of the failures, Carlyle and the other owners made sure to secure tidy profits for themselves, <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/energy/philadelphia-energy-solutions-files-bankruptcy-plan-20180122.html"">taking more than $400 million in dividends</a> from PES, more than half of which was financed through <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-pes-bankruptcy-insight/refiner-goes-belly-up-after-big-payouts-to-carlyle-group-idUSKCN1G40I1"">debt against the refinery.</a> As a result, even after emerging from bankruptcy reorganization in August 2018, it seemed likely that PES was again <a href=""https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/paper/beyond-bankruptcy"">heading for bankruptcy</a>. When a massive explosion shook the refinery on June 21, that became a reality sooner than expected as PES decided to cease operations and once-again <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pes-bankruptcy/philadelphia-energy-solutions-files-for-bankruptcy-after-refinery-fire-idUSKCN1UH0O9"">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a>.</p>

<p>PES is now attempting to restructure its debt and reorganize, and Phil Rinaldi is back in the picture once again attempting to get another bailout for the facility. Aside from restarting the facility, this time he also proposes to build a digester to create methane gas from the city&rsquo;s food waste, but that greenwashing is not only too little and too late to cover up the failures of the past, it doesn&rsquo;t begin to offset the continued pollution from the plant. The petrochemical industry isn&rsquo;t the economic savior it&rsquo;s made out to be, but that is apparently a hard lesson to learn.</p>

<p><strong>We Must Act on Climate</strong></p>

<p>Last October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/"">a special report</a> finding that to have a reasonable chance at keeping global warming below 1.5 &deg;C we will need to reduce emissions by 45 percent from 2010 to 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

<p>That recommendation is significantly more aggressive than the one put forth under the Paris Agreement, which calls for a 26 to 28 percent reduction in emissions from 2005 to 2030. It is also bolder than the path put forth by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, who proposed meeting the Paris Agreement goal and then reaching an 80 percent reduction by 2050.</p>

<p>Philadelphia has responded with its <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/documents/powering-our-future-a-clean-energy-vision-for-philadelphia/"">Clean Energy Vision</a> and is attempting to shift electricity consumption to 100 percent renewable generation by 2050. City leaders are also taking other positive steps such as planning to convert the city&rsquo;s street lights to more efficient LEDs. But, pollution from our electric grid is just one piece of a larger problem. We need to come to terms with our overreliance on dirty fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The gas industry often claims that carbon pollution has declined as natural gas generation has replaced coal on our power grid, but these claims overlook the fact that those reductions are not sustainable. As recently as 2004, Pennsylvania had 90 percent of its generation coming from either nuclear or coal and 5 percent coming from gas. By 2017, Pennsylvania had 34 percent of our generation coming from gas. With 27 percent of our nuclear capacity scheduled to go offline in the next two years, coupled with sharply declining coal generation, gas could easily become 70 percent or more of our generation. That scenario would be a climate killer, and it doesn&rsquo;t even consider the gas used outside of generation in facilities like the Philadelphia Energy Solutions facility.</p>

<p><strong>Attempting to Restart Operations is a Dangerous and Unsustainable Pathway</strong></p>

<p>When we dump money into the petrochemical industry we are buying additional problems that will need to be fixed&mdash;possibly at great expense to taxpayers&mdash;in a few short years. Often, as in the case of PES, this goes beyond carbon pollution. The refinery was the <a href=""https://iaspub.epa.gov/triexplorer/tri_release.facility"">largest source of toxic air emissions</a> in southeast Pennsylvania and has also been a significant emitter of ozone-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) as well as particulate emissions.</p>

<p>As is common with petrochemical plants, even with the facility closed the environmental problems don&rsquo;t go away. There are 1,300 acres of heavily contaminated soil and groundwater that must be remediated, but also ongoing air pollution. PES will likely be able to register the reductions in VOC, NOx, PM-10, and PM-2.5 emissions from its closure as Emission Reduction Credits (ERCs) with the Pennsylvania DEP. These credits have a 10-year shelf life and can then be purchased by other entities who want to increase emissions. Delaying closure of this plant could mean more pollution for years.</p>

<p>Moreover, the remediation of PES should not be delayed. The site is already at a heightened risk for flooding during severe weather events and, at the rates of sea-level rise predicted by the IPCC, areas of the site could be underwater before 2050 and most of the site could be flooded before 2100. The more we wait, the more we risk of additional catastrophic events that will result in much higher remediation costs.</p>

<p><strong>We Need To Focus on Building Sustainable Industries and Jobs</strong></p>

<p>If we are going to reach our climate goals, and if we are going to address the chronic air pollution impacting the residents of the region, the city needs to transition away from fossil fuels to more sustainable industries. In the near term, we need skilled workers to assist with the closure and remediation of the site, but we also need a long term plan. We see this vividly in the coal and nuclear industries where plants are reaching the end of their useful life and no new plants are being built to replace them. Those jobs are going away and, for the most part, there has been little thought given to the transition of the workforce.</p>

<p>While relatively low fuel prices and considerable subsidies makes gas and other petrochemicals inexpensive, the industry suffers from the same fundamental problem. Fossil fuel prices have always been volatile and prices are likely to rise. Clean renewable alternatives, on the other hand, are already cost-competitive in many areas and prices continue to fall. Subsidizing fundamentally unsustainable industries like petrochemicals isn&rsquo;t the path to long-term job growth, it actually creates more at-risk workers.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that when the Bureau of Labor Statistics projected the <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/home.htm"">top 20 fastest growing job sectors from 2016 to 2026</a>, solar installers and wind turbine service technicians topped the list with 105 percent and 96 percent growth respectively while no petrochemical jobs made that list. We see similar results in Pennsylvania where a recent report from the National Association of State Energy Officials showed that solar alone already accounts for well over 4,000 jobs in Pennsylvania with much less than one percent of our generation.</p>

<p>While the future is in green jobs, a number of fossil fuel jobs will continue to be necessary, particularly for the safe closure and remediation of retiring facilities. Unfortunately PES recently announced layoffs of almost almost 400 union workers, including maintenance workers and operators. This raises significant concerns that there will be a lack of qualified staff to safely wind down operations.</p>

<p><strong>A Pathway Forward</strong></p>

<p>Recently, more than 300 stakeholders came together with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on a project called &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PASolarFuture/plan"">Finding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future</a>&rdquo; to identify 15 key strategies and 52 separate action items that could significantly enhance clean renewable energy deployment in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>One key ask of the stakeholders was to support the creation and adoption of uniform policies to streamline siting and land-use issues while encouraging conservation. In certain cases, co-locating solar resources with agricultural operations may be beneficial, but often we are seeking to preserve prime agricultural and forest land and encourage solar on less valuable property, including former industrial sites. We&rsquo;ve seen this used across the border in New Jersey where PSE&amp;G reported that landfill and brownfield solar sites were about 40 percent less expensive than typical residential installations.</p>

<p>While direct policy intervention to encourage renewable development on brownfields is a possibility, programs could also indirectly encourage development on brownfields by easing access to capital. Some programs, like expanding our Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards or Enabling community solar in Pennsylvania, will take state action, but Philadelphia could take action on its own in a number of different forms such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Expanding the availability of solar lending products through a green bank.</li>
	<li>Lowering interest rates through loan loss reserves.</li>
	<li>Easing third-party financing decisions by entering into long-term contracts for solar energy from new facilities on brownfields.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few of the action items identified, but even if it is not an exhaustive list, the stakeholder project has clearly shown that there is considerable interest in these policies and a significant amount of expertise in the region ready to assist in their further development. With the closure of PES, the city has an opportunity to leverage this work to rapidly expand its sustainable development. We encourage the city to do so.</p>

In the Headlights - 2020,8/30/2019,"<p>I do pretty well living in the moment and staying focused on tasks at hand, but I enjoy being strategic, and that means having a forward-looking orientation. This is a time of year when everyone talks about the swift passage of time as our short summers begin to transition to autumn. I fully appreciate the imminent arrival of the holiday season and, with it, the turning of our calendars to 2020.</p>

<p>Between now and then, our state legislators will reconvene for a final six-week push before this legislative session ends. This will be another chance for our state&rsquo;s elected officials to do the business of the peopleand to do what is needed for our environment and climate.</p>

<p>With the arrival of a new season comes new priorities. PennFuture will be working to shape important proposals to preserve our nuclear fleet as a hedge against climate pollution, and there has been talk about fees on carbon pollution that we are keenly interested in. Will our legislature find a path forward to help pay for the myriad of voluntary measures encompassed in the Phase 3 Watershed Implementation Plan for the Chesapeake Bay, which can result in dramatic improvements in our local streams and rivers? This can only happen if our legislators grasp the dire need for dedicated funding for clean water and find a revenue source for it.</p>

<p>We typically see a flurry of legislation at the end of the session. The need for action in Harrisburg this fall and this session feels particularly important. I&rsquo;m concerned that once we cross into 2020, all attention will turn to the national election. Activists, advocates, politicians, donors, voters &ndash; appropriately &ndash; will be laser focused on the outcomes in early primary states, the nominating conventions, campaigns and the election for the next president.</p>

<p>When PennFuture formed its strategic alliance with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, it created capacity for PennFuture to launch a civic engagement program. This program is marked by our on-the-ground community organizing; growing our ACE (Advocates for Conservation and Education) teams thatplay a role in educating their elected officials on important issues; and elevating non-partisan campaign conversations about environmental issues among all candidates for public office. You might recall hearing about our Common Agenda for Conservation during the last gubernatorial campaign.</p>

<p>As a 501 (c) (3) organization, PennFuture is strictly prohibited from engaging in political activity, endorsements and elections. However, the IRS does grant latitude in the role we can play in reaching a segment of the population known as the New American Majority, also referred to as the Rising American Electorate. This segment is defined by individuals of color, single women and millennials. The IRS allows us to do non-partisan voter registration in places where these demographics are prevalent, but where there are substantial gaps in their voting registrations.PennFuture hopes to begin voter registration work in early 2020. We also hope to do &ldquo;Get Out the Vote&rdquo; work closer to the 2020 general election.</p>

<p>Many of the national environmental groups are focusing on Pennsylvania in 2020, and it&rsquo;s no surprise that others of all stripes will be politically engaged here.</p>

<p>The other momentous event upcoming in 2020 is the 50th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22. Commemorations of Earth Day 1970 cannot be nostalgic events. We must show up, speak up and unequivocally and unapologetically acknowledge the vicious attacks on our environment, communities and public health that have taken place in recent years, and use this Earth Day to create change.</p>

<p>On Earth Day, we must make welcome all and elevate the energy of our climate youth, their families and the front line communities confronted still with the realities of pollution and a dystopian climate future if we do not act and create change in 2020. PennFuture hopes to provide many opportunities for you to join us for Earth Day 2020 action in the coming months.</p>

<p>Regardless, work remains to close out 2019, and we&rsquo;ll be sure to keep fighting for our shared environment in Harrisburg and all across Pennsylvania.</p>

Tohickon Creek Is Saved...For Now,8/28/2019,"<p>The lower Tohickon Creek, located immediately downstream of the dam at Lake Nockamixon, was designatedas part of the Lower Delaware National Wild and Scenic River in 2000. Located in Bucks County, the Tohickon flows through protected lands likeRalph Stover State Park and provides some of the best recreational opportunities in the area, especially for seasonal whitewater enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Almost 25 years ago, the Tinicum Conservancy petitioned to have the lower Tohickon Creek redesignated to an &ldquo;Exceptional Value&rdquo;stream to recognize and protect its outstanding water quality. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection is the agency tasked with reviewing the petition. Unfortunately, DEP&rsquo;s initial recommendation was to downgrade the lower Tohickon&rsquo;s designated use in 1997. In response and since that time, Tinicum Conservancy, Delaware Riverkeeper Networkand others have repeatedly given DEP numerous data, reports, and information supporting the petition for EV designation. Despite these efforts, earlier this year, DEP issued<a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/Drinking Water and Facility Regulation/WaterQualityPortalFiles/Stream_Packages/Tunkhannock_Creek/Tohickon Creek Draft Report.pdf"">another draft redesignation recommendation</a> which again proposed to downgrade the protections for the creek.</p>

<p>A quick primer on stream designations: In Pennsylvania,surface water is given a &ldquo;designated use&rdquo; which is established based on the ecological and human health uses of a particular waterbody. A designated use is the water quality goal set by the state, whether or not that use is actually being attained. In the case of the lower Tohickon, it is currently designated as a &ldquo;Cold Water Fishes&rdquo; waterbody.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.pacode.com/secure/data/025/chapter93/chap93toc.html"">Water Quality Standards require</a> that the designated uses of each waterbody be protected. Any person can petition the state to change the designated use of a waterbody, based on biological, chemical, or physical characteristics of the water. The 1995 redesignation petition sought for the lower Tohickon&rsquo;s designated use to be changed to Exceptional Value, the most protective of the designated uses. The DEP, however, proposed to change the lower Tohickon to &ldquo;Trout Stocking Fishery,&rdquo; which requires less stringent protections than a &ldquo;Cold Water Fishes&rdquo; designation. For more on the redesignation process, please view<a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/News/PennFutureStreamHndbk09.pdf"">PennFuture&rsquo;s Stream Redesignation Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>PennFuture &ndash; along with over 60 of our members and supporters &ndash; stood up for the lower Tohickon and told DEP not to downgrade or remove critical protections for the creek. As PennFuture <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-strongly-opposes-any-attempts-to-downgrade-status-of-the-Tohickon-Creek"">pointed out in our letter</a>, a downgrade of the lower Tohickon is not supported by the data and is an inappropriate action for the DEP to take.</p>

<p>The good news: In response to this public outcry, DEP stated that it has agreed to undertake further analysis of the Lake Nockamixon Dam to see how operational or infrastructural changes could affect its analysis.</p>

<p>We are very pleased that DEP has pulled back from its faulty analysis and has stated its commitment to a thorough analysis of the lower Tohickon Creek. Butif history is any indication, we know that the battle over the lower Tohickon may not be over yet. PennFuture will continue to monitor DEP&rsquo;s analysis and ensure the appropriate protections are in place for Tohickon Creek.</p>

<p>We have to be vigilant to protect the lower Tohickon Creek &ndash; and all the waters of the Commonwealth &ndash; not only from pollution, but from regulatory rollbacks that threaten to remove protections and degrade our waters.</p>

Pennsylvania still not doing its part to restore the Chesapeake Bay,8/26/2019,"<p>When the Environmental Protection Agency developed a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the Chesapeake Bay in 2010, it marked a historic cleanup effort to restore one of our nation&rsquo;s most precious treasures.</p>

<p>The Bay TMDL identifies the total amount of certain pollutants (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment) that the entire Chesapeake Bay Watershed &mdash; including portions of Pennsylvania &mdash; can contribute, but still be able to restore water quality in the Bay to a level that will support protected water uses, like swimming and fishing. To ensure pollutant reductions are achieved, the Bay TMDL establishes deadlines for the states to develop and implement plans within the watershed to reduce these pollutants.</p>

<p>Each State&rsquo;s proposal to accomplish these reductions must be articulated in their respective plans, called Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs), in order to provide &ldquo;reasonable assurance&rdquo; that the required reductions in pollution will be achieved, EPA is responsible for evaluating whether the plans are sufficient.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s contributions to the Chesapeake Bay cleanup is incredibly important. Approximately half of the land area of Pennsylvania drains to the Chesapeake Bay, and Pennsylvania comprises 35 percent of the entire Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The Susquehanna River is by far the largest tributary to the Bay, providing 90 percent of the freshwater flow to the upper Bay and half of the total freshwater that enters the Bay. Without Pennsylvania getting its act together, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed has little hope of being restored.</p>

<p>Since even before the Bay TMDL&rsquo;s implementation, PennFuture has worked to support efforts to reduce pollution to the Susquehanna River. When agricultural interests initially challenged the Bay TMDL in federal court, PennFuture intervened to support EPA. We have lobbied in Harrisburg for funding for pollution reduction programs and pressed for robust water quality protections in permits and agency programs.</p>

<p>PennFuture serves as the Pennsylvania state lead for the Choose Clean Water Coalition, which harnesses the collective power of more than 230 groups to advocate for clean rivers and streams in the Chesapeake Bay region. Most recently our President &amp; CEO, Jacqui Bonomo, served on the Forestry Workgroup of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s third WIP Steering Committee, which provided feedback and input on industry best management practices.</p>

<p>However, even with all of these efforts, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waters and the Chesapeake Bay remain polluted. Over the years of implementing the Bay TMDL, Pennsylvania has consistently fallen short. During EPA&rsquo;s midpoint assessment, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s agriculture and urban/suburban sectors were at the &ldquo;backstop action level,&rdquo; meaning that EPA identified substantial concerns with the strategy to implement the TMDL goals and had taken necessary federal actions to get Pennsylvania back on track. Unfortunately, these efforts seem to have been to little avail as Pennsylvania&rsquo;s third WIP remains woefully insufficient.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s third WIP provides little assurance that the state will achieve the required pollution reduction goals. It doesn&rsquo;t even set forth a plan that, if fully implemented, would achieve the goals. There is little accountability built into the plan, and Pennsylvania faces a huge gap in necessary funding to be able to even implement this deficient plan, let alone the measures necessary to actually reduce pollution.</p>

<p>As Pennsylvania submits its deficient WIP3 to EPA for its review and approval, it faces threats of liability. Since the Plan clearly does not provide the necessary &ldquo;reasonable assurances&rdquo; that reduction targets will be approved, EPA can not legitimately approve the plan. Other states are also displeased with Pennsylvania&rsquo;s lack of progress. Maryland&rsquo;s Governor Larry Hogan <a href=""https://governor.maryland.gov/2019/05/29/governor-hogan-voices-concerns-over-pennsylvania-clean-water-progress/"">even sent a letter to Governor Wolf</a> expressing his deep concern that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Plan falls short of its critical commitment. And a recent editorial suggested that a lawsuit could be the way to put Pennsylvania back on track. Each of these threats would cost Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania legislature should fund programs that reduce pollution to our rivers and streams to ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t incur even more expenses by failing to do what is necessary.</p>

<p>PennFuture <a href=""/Files/Admin/20190607-PF-WIP3-comments.pdf"">recently submitted public comments</a> on Pennsylvania&rsquo;s draft WIP3 commending the Department of Environmental Protection on the stakeholder engagement deployed in the development of the WIP, but critiquing the Plan&rsquo;s significant shortfalls such as its failure to design to meet the minimum necessary reductions of nitrogen, articulate an accountability structure, or ensure the funding necessary to meet even its marginal reductions.For these reasons, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s WIP3 does not provide the necessary &ldquo;reasonable assurance&rdquo; that the required reductions in pollution will be achieved. Even with the modifications the Department has made since the public comment period ended, we do not believe Pennsylvania&rsquo;s WIP3 satisfies the required standard to be approved by the EPA.</p>

<p>However, as Pennsylvania continues to lag behind the other states, it is important that some progress begins to be made. In light of this, we hope a path can be created that directs Pennsylvania to immediately implement critical elements in its WIP3 while the Department works on addressing the significant deficiencies and shortfalls in its Plan.</p>

<p>We will continue to work with Pennsylvania state agencies to implement pollution reduction measures, advocate to the legislature to support funding to implement important practices, and monitor those that contribute pollution for compliance with the law and opportunities to go further.</p>

Running for a Reason,8/21/2019,"<p>How far are you willing to go to prove a point?</p>

<p>For Sam Bencheghib, it&rsquo;s about 3,100 miles, or roughly the distance between New York and Los Angeles. All on foot, in the span of 160 days, running on shoes made from recycled plastics.</p>

<p>That last part is important, because it underscores the purpose of every step of his journey. Sam Bencheghib is running across America to raise awareness about the massive amounts of plastic currently polluting our oceans and waterways.</p>

<p>Sam, who recently met with PennFuture employees in Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, doesn&rsquo;t mince words when explaining the importance of his run. By 2050, there will be more plastic in our oceans than fish. There are already more microplastics in our oceans and on our beaches than stars in our galaxy, he said.</p>

<p>The problems posed by plastic pollution are massive, yet the issue isn&rsquo;t being addressed on a global scale by governments and corporations. That doesn&rsquo;t deter Sam from his journey, though. In fact, it only makes him more motivated to raise awareness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you have to do something crazy to get peoplesattention,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>His journey started on July 26 in New York City, and it didn&rsquo;t take long to pass over into New Jersey and Pennsylvania. From there, his path will take him through West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and California. He hopes to arrive near Los Angeles on Dec. 20.</p>

<p>To put it into perspective, Sam will be running the equivalent of about 115 marathons in a span of about 160 days, with a goal of running between 20 to 30 miles per day. He will stop to rest only on the weekends and usually only in bigger cities, where he intends on meeting with and speaking to college students, environmental organizations and local politicians about the need to address the plastics pollution epidemic.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what he did in Pennsylvania, meeting with local politicians and community activists. Sam said his goal is to get people on board with his message, but it&rsquo;s been a challenge in Pennsylvania because of a <a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/news/2019/06/pa-blocks-plastic-bag-bans-for-at-least-a-year.html"">recently passed moratorium</a> on plastic bag bans.</p>

<p>That so-called &ldquo;ban on bans&rdquo; was enacted as part of budget discussions in Harrisburg in June, and bars local municipalities and cities from banning plastic bags for at least a year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Pennsylvania, it&rsquo;s been a lot harder than I thought it would be,&rdquo; Sam said about creating awareness and momentum for his movement.</p>

<p>The difficulties found within Pennsylvania won&rsquo;t derail his message, Sam said. After all, fighting against plastic pollution has been a passion of his since he was a young boy on the Indonesian island of Bali.</p>

<p>During his childhood, Sam and his older brother would clean up beaches in Bali, completely removing any traces of plastic. It wouldn&rsquo;t even take 24 hours before the beaches would be full of plastic again, a product of local streams and rivers carrying the pollution into the ocean and onto the beaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt we were making a difference but, realistically, were we really making a difference?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when we decided to focus on rivers and streams and educating local government and businesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that experience came a new organization founded by Sam and his brother called &ldquo;<a href=""https://makeachange.world/"">Make a Change World</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam, who is 22 years old, brought his message and ambition to America when he enrolled at Lehigh University in eastern Pennsylvania. Recently graduated, Sam knew there would be no better time to spread a message that desperately needs to be heard.</p>

<p>During the cross-country run, he will be accompanied by friend Josh Madre, who follows behind Sam in an RV and documents the journey with a video camera. The entire journey can be tracked on the organization&rsquo;s website at <a href=""https://makeachange.world/"">https://makeachange.world</a>.</p>

<p>For his part, Sam understands the daunting task ahead of him, both in running across the vast expanse of America, and in trying to combat a problem in plastics pollution that is already at a crisis level. But he isn&rsquo;t deterred, either in body or spirit, because he knows he will bring about change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing this if I didn&rsquo;t think it would make a difference,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every step I take across this country is one step closer to a world without plastic pollution.&quot;</p>

The Problem with Pipelines,8/5/2019,"<p>The burgeoning petrochemical movement is in its infancy in western Pennsylvania, but we&rsquo;ve already experienced significant detriments to both the environment and private property because of fracking and pipeline accidents.</p>

<p>Take a look at the recent track record of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners. Maybe you&rsquo;ve never heard of the company, but you&rsquo;ve almost certainly heard about its pipeline projects.</p>

<p>The Dakota Access Pipeline, which was so controversial that <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/dakota-pipeline-protests/north-dakota-governor-orders-pipeline-protesters-leave-citing-winter-weather-n689366"">thousands of people staged a sit-in protest</a> over environmental concerns. The Mariner East 2 pipeline &mdash; constructed by Sunoco, which is a subsidiary of Energy Transfer &mdash; which was beset by so many spills, sinkholes, and shutdowns that Attorney General Josh Shapiro <a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/news/2019/03/pa-attorney-general-launches-investigation-into-mariner-east-ii-pipeline.html"">opened a criminal investigation</a> into the project. The Revolution Pipeline in western Pennsylvania, which exploded last September, <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/09/10/natural-gas-pipeline-blast-in-beaver-county-prompts-evacuation/"">destroying one house and damaging another</a> while literally shaking an entire community.</p>

<p>Those are just the glaring examples of incompetence. There are others, like the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) assessing a $355,000 penalty against Energy Transfer Partners for <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/05/03/dep-hits-sunoco-with-another-fine-for-mariner-east-2-pipeline-construction/"">polluting streams and wetlands</a> across nine Pennsylvania counties. Or another fine from the DEP &mdash; <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/news/20180827/texas-company-fined-for-damages-to-raccoon-creek-during-pipeline-construction"">to the tune of $150,000</a> &mdash; after polluting a portion of Raccoon Creek in Beaver County last summer.</p>

<p>All told, Energy Transfer <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/ProgramIntegration/Pennsylvania-Pipeline-Portal/Pages/Mariner-East-II.aspx#Compliance"">has been hit with nearly 100 violations</a> &mdash; the most recent coming on July 26 &mdash;from the Mariner East project alone, and fines that surpass $13 million.</p>

<p>The list goes on. The situation became so untenable in Pennsylvania that the DEP <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/02/08/DEP-halts-permit-review-gas-pipeline-Energy-Transfer-Sunoco-Revolution-Mariner-East-Pennsylvania/stories/201902080125"">suspended all permit reviews</a> for all of Energy Transfer Partners&rsquo; ongoing projects. This, only after the company <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/05/14/DEP-Energy-Transfer-fix-damage-streams-wetlands-revolution-pipeline-Beaver-permit/stories/201905140158"">failed to abide by a DEP order</a> to resolve issues at the Beaver County explosion site.</p>

<p>As if a criminal investigation from one state agency and permit suspensions from another weren&rsquo;t enough, Gov. Tom Wolf <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-issues-statement-dep-pipeline-permit-bar/"">entered the fray</a> with a damning statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been a failure by Energy Transfer and its subsidiaries to respect our laws and our communities,&rdquo; Wolf said in a news release. &ldquo;This is not how we strive to do business in Pennsylvania, and it will not be tolerated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a step in the right direction that Gov. Wolf acknowledged the repeated failures of the pipeline industry in Pennsylvania, but is it enough? Evidence suggests otherwise.</p>

<p>Even after the debacles of the Mariner East and Revolution pipelines, the DEP in December <a href=""https://archive.triblive.com/news/state-dep-action-clears-way-for-construction-of-shell-falcon-ethane-pipeline-in-3-counties/"">approvedconstruction of an ethane pipeline</a> that will feed up to 107,000 barrels per day to Royal Dutch Shell&rsquo;s cracker plant in Beaver County.</p>

<p>Based on past experiences, can you guess what&rsquo;s already happened? During construction, Shell&rsquo;s pipeline <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/ProgramIntegration/Pennsylvania-Pipeline-Portal/Pages/Shell.aspx"">incurred four violations from the DEP</a> between April and July alone. The most recent violation on July 22involved the spilling of 500 gallons of drilling fluid, 30 gallons of which impactedRaccoon Creek, the same waterway previously impacted by Energy Transfer Partners.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want this to be your future, action is required. The fracked gas, pipeline, and plastics manufacturing companies have millions of dollars to throw at public relations, and too often put profits over people.</p>

<p>As Energy Transfer Partners polluted and destroyed Pennsylvania, they experienced <a href=""https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-reports-fourth-quarter-2018-results-record"">&ldquo;record performance and continued growth&rdquo;</a> in the fourth quarter of 2018. The company hasn&rsquo;t missed a beat and isn&rsquo;t slowed down in the slightest. The pollution it created in Pennsylvania and fines it was assessed are simply a part ofdoing business. It&rsquo;s a machine that will churn on as long as we let it.</p>

<p>Last month, Energy Transfer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs26xnjBXkk"">began running television advertisements</a> across Pennsylvania, showing pristine farmland and rolling hillsides. The narrator of the commercial insists that Americas oil and gas moves through 2.4 million miles of underground pipelines &ldquo;safely.&rdquo; Ask Beaver County residents &mdash;those who <a href=""https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/09/10/center-township-gas-line-explosion-fire/"">saw the fireball</a>, those who were <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/09/10/natural-gas-pipeline-blast-in-beaver-county-prompts-evacuation/"">forced to evacuate</a>, those who could <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/news/20190111/pipeline-company-buys-properties-near-explosion-site-in-center-twp"">never return home</a> &mdash;how safe pipelines really are.</p>

<p>Does that sound like a company that is remorseful about its actions in Pennsylvania? Does that sound like a company that has any intention of acknowledging the role it plays in destroying our environment? No, it sounds like a company that is bent on throwing money at a public relations disaster until it goes away, only until another pops up. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let this be our future.</p>

PennFuture's Rob Altenburg appointed to DEP committee,7/26/2019,"<p>One of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s foremost experts in air quality issues just got another accolade to add to an already-impressive resume.</p>

<p>Rob Altenburg, the director of the PennFuture Energy Center, has previously been invited to testify before the state legislature, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the White House. Now, he&rsquo;s taking his talents back to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the same agency where Rob started his career nearly three decades ago.</p>

<p>Effective July 1st, DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell appointed Rob to a two-year term on the agency&rsquo;s Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee. In that role, Rob will provide input on regulatory packages and other key proposals from the department&rsquo;s Bureau of Air Quality.</p>

<p>This won&rsquo;t be his first interaction with the DEP. Rob&rsquo;s first environmental job was with the Bureau of Air Quality, working on new rules to implement the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act.</p>

<p>He focused on calculating and predicting emissions from factories, vehicles, and off-road equipment and was soon working on computer models to predict concentrations of air pollutants. For years, Rob was the primary forecaster for the south central and Lehigh Valley regions of Pennsylvania, deciding if certain days met the parameters for air quality action days.</p>

<p>Rob attended law school in the evenings while working full time and, after graduation, became an executive policy specialist in DEP&rsquo;s policy office. In that role he advised the governor&rsquo;s office and executive staff on a variety of environmental and public health issues and worked to improve public participation in the department&rsquo;s decision-making.</p>

<p>In response to his appointment, Rob said he was happy and proud to be given the chance to give back to the agency that gave him a start in the environmental world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very happy to hear from Secretary McDonnell that I&rsquo;ve been appointed to serve on the Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My first environmental job was with the DEP 27 years ago, so I&rsquo;m proud to be able to give something back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We here at PennFuture applaud Rob, and we can&rsquo;t wait to see his great work continue with the DEP.</p>

The Opportunity for Green Stormwater Infrastructure in Philadelphia’s Rebuild Initiative,7/18/2019,"<p>By combining the goals of Green City, Clean Waters and the Rebuild Community Infrastructure (Rebuild) Initiative, Philadelphia can align two major infrastructure investments and multiply its investment in its residents, our neighborhoods, and the environment.</p>

<p>The Rebuild Initiative, made possible by the Philadelphia Beverage Tax, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in physical improvements to our neighborhood parks, recreation centers, and libraries. From a list of more than 400 eligible sites, the Rebuild office is prioritizing neighborhoods that face high rates of poverty, drug crime, and poor health outcomes. It is selecting facilities where investment will promote community development and stabilization, as well as sites that are in extremely poor condition. It is currently moving forward on revitalizing <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/programs/rebuild/project-sites/"">more than 50 sites</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to making physical improvements to these sites, Rebuild prioritizes engaging community members in the site planning and design process as well as promoting diversity and economic inclusion through small business and workforce development initiatives.</p>

<p>Parks, recreation centers, and libraries offer many social and community benefits. Libraries create opportunities for learning and access to important services. Parks and recreation centers are areas where neighbors gather for play, exercise, social interaction and other leisure activities. They also serve as safe spaces for our city&rsquo;s residents. Studies have shown that having access to parks or green space can reduce stress and contribute to improved general psychological health and well-being for people who live or work nearby.</p>

<p>Rebuild represents a major investment in our city and its people. Another major city investment &ndash; Green City, Clean Waters &ndash; creates very similar tangible benefits for residents while also creating a cleaner and more resilient environment. Green City, Clean Waters is Philadelphia&rsquo;s 25-year stormwater management program initiated in 2011 that invests primarily in green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) to manage combined sewer overflows. As stormwater runs off roads, parking lots, and roofs it picks up oil, dirt, and other pollutants that make their way to storm drains.</p>

<p>Approximately sixty percent of Philadelphia&rsquo;s storm drain system is a combined system that mixes stormwater with household wastewater. Most large storms cause untreated sewage to overflow directly into local rivers and creeks. The Philadelphia Water Department defines GSI as a &ldquo;soil-water-plant system that intercepts stormwater, infiltrates a portion of it into the ground, evaporates a portion of it into the air, and in some cases releases a portion of it slowly back into the sewer system.&rdquo; GSI tools reduce pollution and flooding events by naturally slowing and filtering rainwater before it enters the city&rsquo;s stormwater system.</p>

<p>Green City, Clean Waters&rsquo; cornerstone is the tangible benefits beyond Clean Water Act compliance that other approaches cannot achieve. GSI implementation has the potential to accomplish substantial triple bottom line benefits&mdash; economic, social, and environmental. GSI creates community green space, revitalizes vacant lots, enhances recreational use, and even has the potential to reduce illegal drug use in public spaces. It decreases heat stress and energy use while improving air quality and contributing to climate change resiliency. It also stabilizes property values and reduces poverty through job creation.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Water Department (PWD), the agency tasked with implementing Green City, Clean Waters, exerts minimal direct control over city property. PWD cannot accomplish all necessary public GSI projects without strong partnerships with other city agencies and stakeholder communities. Parks and recreation centers are more than just the physical buildings &ndash; they are situated on impervious surfaces and open spaces, thereby providing ideal opportunities to manage stormwater with GSI.</p>

<p>While the Rebuild Initiative process includes a commitment to sustainability, communities can advocate for GSI projects that provide additional benefits. The Rebuild Initiative is prioritizing community engagement to inform the improvements made to facilities. Public participation in GSI and parks and recreation center design is essential for achieving the positive community benefits they are expected to create.</p>

<p>Residents can advocate for GSI in the Rebuild Initiative by attending Rebuild community engagement events, meeting with park advisory committees, friends groups, and civic associations, requesting GSI be implemented in design plans, meeting with their city council members to discuss Rebuild investment, and writing a letter to the editor in support of GSI investment in their Rebuild site.</p>

<p>Green Stormwater Infrastructure is integral to Philadelphia&rsquo;s economy, environment, and social equity. If you agree, please sign our petition <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/keepphillygreenandwatercleancopy1/index.html"">here</a>, which will be delivered to city council.</p>


",Environment; Keep Philly Green & Water Clean,Lena Smith
Six Months That Shifted My World,7/17/2019,"<p>I&rsquo;m still navigating the occurrences of the last six months.</p>

<p>&hellip;on the surface, wave after wave of new climate impact science and data pointing to our rapidly changing planet and the lives of its people. One million species threatened and species extinction accelerating at an unprecedented rate. Record high tides and sunny day floods in our coastal cities, mostly along the East Coast, but also hitting the Gulf of Mexico and Washington state.</p>

<p>&hellip;in the undertow, closer to home, state policymakers torpedoing a policy chance to shore up Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nuclear fleet and hold the line on climate pollution, and missed chances to strengthen the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, both set out to sea because the proposals displease the fracked gas industry.</p>

<p>All around, the climate emergency has settled upon us and our natural systems are fraying -- a jet stream in disarray, record flooding throughout the Commonwealth, a heat wave that delivers the highest temperatures ever recorded in Alaska, record temperatures in France, tornadic threats in the Mid-Atlantic and funnels touching the ground within miles of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>I want to find and give hope through these PennFuture correspondences, but my personal certainty in being able to say that a doomsday future is not inevitable is fading fast. The brutality of the facts and the political reality of our state has moved me. I reckoned with climate change facts a long time ago; it&rsquo;s facing the facts of what is happening in the halls of our state Legislature and executive branch that we must deal with now.</p>

<p>The influence of the fracked gas industry on our Legislature appears to be at stranglehold strength. While we see willingness from many legislators from both sides of the aisle to do the right thing on behalf of our environment, good proposals cannot make it past the solid brick wall that Speaker Mike Turzai has built to protect industry interests, with the help of well-placed anti-environmental committee chairs like Daryl Metcalfe.</p>

<p>The viewpoint of our Governor that Pennsylvania can be part of the climate solution while championing the growth of fracked gas for petrochemicals and dirty energy is incongruous. Is this born of naivete, design or a stubborn unwillingness to face the facts, at least as I see them? Or is the fracked gas industry just too powerful to push back against?</p>

<p>I encounter so many people who are involved with climate issues for the sake of their children and grandchildren and, while not a parent, I have that orientation toward future generations too. And if I pause to project those children of today into an unravelling future 30 years out, I find myself asking how, literally, will they survive? Where will they live and still be sheltered from what surely will become climate chaos if we do not act soon?</p>

<p>This personal sharing comes after six months that also included working with PennFuture&rsquo;s staff and board on our new strategic plan. The plan sets forth a trajectory of action to meet the challenges of our time. Our voice is changing, too, as we place the science of climate change as our North Star, even if it puts into question pragmatism on natural gas issues. Certainly, our changing voice and straight talk may close doors for the organization, but not calling attention to obstacles and calling out obstructionists also closes doors to the solutions we need to avert disaster. Inaction is a far greater risk than aggressive advocacy.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s acknowlege -- for now -- that Pennsylvania is not up to the task of being a climate champion. So far we have been a climate failure. Our energy policy lacks vision, creativity, and contains nothing beyond what the marketplace will take care of on its own without a helping hand from us. In failing to stand up to the fracked gas industry, our elected officials are ceding the health and well-being of our people to corporations, like we have done in decades past when coal ruled the Commonwealth. We&rsquo;ve seemingly learned nothing along the way.</p>

<p>Change must come, and if the Governor and Legislature will not act, the people and organizations like PennFuture must do more. We must speak louder, resist in greater numbers, vote in greater numbers and put unprecedented pressure on these bad actors. We must create change.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have had a chance to interact with many of you over the last six months. All of you have validated the path forward &ndash; through your intellect, your professional pursuits, your bold advocacy, support and friendship. You inspire my passion for this work and that is all I need to work harder every day to make good things happen.</p>

Pennsylvania State Budget Turns Blind Eye to Environment,7/11/2019,"<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-e4d35231-7fff-9e6a-fa32-0d0cbe4b2d7b""></span>Late last month, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a $33.97 billion spending plan that will serve as the financial roadmap for the next fiscal year. The General Assembly passed all accompanying bills and Governor Wolf signed the budget bills into law on June 28 before fleeing Harrisburg for the summer.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">So how does this budget impact our environment?</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">This year&rsquo;s budget was on time, but is it a good plan? Not quite. Especially in a year where there was a budget surplus, Governor Wolf and state lawmakers who approved this budget package should be ashamed for maneuvers thatcalled for cutting funding from critical conservation funding such as the Environmental Stewardship Fund, among others.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Pennsylvania is facing many challenges related to the climate crisis,as well as woefully understaffed and underfunded agencies and a maintenance backlog of hundreds of millions of dollars for our state park and forest system. Despite that, this budget package basically says it&rsquo;s in the best interest of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s citizens to cut even more money from environmental protection and conservation.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">A glaring example is found within the state Department of Environmental Protection, which continues to be staffed at 1994 levels and has seen its funding cut by 30 percent since 2002.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Recent reports show that Pennsylvania should be investing nearly $257 million per year on implementation of best management practices in the Chesapeake Bay watershed alone to meet clean water goals, not to mention millions of dollars more needed to solve our clean water problems in the Delaware and Ohio watersheds and the need to overhaul drinking water systems in our cities.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Pennsylvania farmers received about $6 million in this year&rsquo;s budget for conservation, but that is just a start, and pales in comparison to the dire need of investment. For several years in a row, the river basin commissions in which Pennsylvania participates - like the Susquehanna and Delaware - are receiving well below their full-share funding.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">With the enactment of this year&rsquo;s budget,Pennsylvania&rsquo;s resource agencies saw increases, but nowhere near the needed levels.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""><strong>Take a closer look at the general fund allocations in the budget</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Department of Agriculture saw a $1.5 million increase for the &ldquo;Agricultural Excellence&rdquo; Conservation program and a $3.5 million transfer from General Operations to the Nutrient Management Fund. Overall, the department saw a $19.49 million increase in funding over last year&rsquo;s budget.</li>
	<li>The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources saw an $874,000 decrease for state park operations, a $3.44 million decrease for state forest operations, a $2 million decrease for heritage and other parks, and a $1.6 million decrease for parks and forest infrastructure projects.Overall, the department saw a $19 million increase in funding compared to last year&rsquo;s budget.</li>
	<li>The Department of Environmental Protection saw a $3.67 million decrease in general government operations, a $2.51 million decrease in environmental program management, a $2.67 million decrease in the Chesapeake Bay Agricultural Abatement Program, and an $8.67 million decrease in environmental protection operations.Overall, the department saw a $2.6 million increase compared to last year&rsquo;s budget</li>
</ul>

<p>Despitedrastic cuts to both the DEP and DCNR budgets,in earlier proposals, both agencies saw their general funds given increases due to fund transfers and new money found during last-minute budget negotiations, including an injection of $45 millionto aid both DEP and DCNR operating budgets. Whilefunding implications and final numbers for the agencies are not yet clear, thisshould be very positive.</p>

<p><strong>What about code bills?</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the appropriations bill and special fund shenanigans, the General Assembly often passes associated &ldquo;code bills&rdquo; that implement the budget across different areas. These code bills are often used to move nefarious pieces of legislation that, by themselves, wouldn&rsquo;t make it through the legislature. Aside from a fairly &ldquo;clean&rdquo; Administrative Code Bill and a Tax Code Bill, which includes a $10 million per year increase for waste coal tax credits, this year&rsquo;s Fiscal Code Bill has a number of troubling provisions. Take a look at a handful of issues below which caused us to raise alarm during the budget negotiations and to further oppose the Fiscal Code legislation in the final days of talks in Harrisburg:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Preemption of Plastics Bans: A provision directs the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee and the Independent Fiscal Office to evaluate the economic and environmental impact of any regulation impacting single-use plastics, reusable plastics, auxiliary containers, wrappings or polystyrene containers and to submit their reports to the General Assembly by July 1, 2020. Until the reports are submitted to the General Assembly, a local governmental body may not pass a law, regulation, or ordinance imposing a tax, fee, or other restrictions on single-use plastics, reusable plastics, auxiliary containers, wrappings or polystyrene containers. Slipped into the Fiscal Code by Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, this language was previously vetoed by Governor Wolf in 2017.</li>
	<li>Changes to the PIPE Program: A part of Speaker Mike Turzai and House Republicans&rsquo; &ldquo;EnergizePA&rdquo; package of legislation (House Bill 1103), this provision provided for the Pipeline Investment Grant Program at the Commonwealth Financing Authority to be changed to allow funding of large residential conversion projects and combined heat and power applications, and the amount of funding applicants can receive was increased to $1.5 million from $1 million. This is yet another buildout of natural gas infrastructure.</li>
	<li>Elimination of the Joint Legislative Air and Water Pollution Control and Conservation Committee: A provision calls for repealing the act which, in 1968, created the 51-year-old legislative body on July 1, 2021. The Joint Legislative Conservation Committee has long served as a bipartisan think tank on environmental and conservation policy for the Legislature.</li>
	<li>Transfers of Environmental &amp; Conservation Special Funds: The Fiscal Code called for raiding the Oil &amp; Gas Lease Fund by $69.8 million to pay for general operations at DCNR, seizing $16.1 million from the Environmental Stewardship Fund (&ldquo;Growing Greener&rdquo;), and $10 million from the Recycling Fund to pay for general operations at DEP; a total of $95.9 million taken from special funds for environmental and conservation projects across the Commonwealth.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Looking to the Fall</strong></p>

<p>State legislators have left Harrisburg for the summer, but the House plans to return on September 17th with the Senate joining them on September 23rd. While a hefty amount of bad bills were blocked or pushed back in the busy spring legislative session by PennFuture and our partners, we expect to see a very active fall.</p>

<p>During the week of budget negotiations, the House narrowly passed House Bill 1105, which would create a &ldquo;Consolidated Permit&rdquo; program at DEP and open the door for shortcuts to environmental standards in individual permitting programs. The Pennsylvania Senate also passed Senate Bill 619 by one vote, which amends the Clean Streams Law to severely narrow the definition of &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; and weakens spill-reporting requirements. We will need to continue our fight against these two dangerous bills.</p>

<p>In addition to these bad bills, we will also be fighting proposals to shortcut our permitting processes by sacrificing public health protections, increase fossil fuel subsidies through EnergizePA, weaken clean air and water protections, and rollback conventional oil and gas regulations.</p>

<p>While there will be plenty of bad bills to fight, we will also be working to pass some important new bills that will help fight climate change by advancing clean energy. We will work to expand and extend our Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) &mdash; increasing wind, solar, and other renewables &mdash; as well as giving more people access to clean energy by enabling community solar.</p>

<p>We will also support putting a cap on carbon pollution and implementing a carbon price, possibly by joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and we will advance programs to aid in infrastructure and climate resiliency such as the Governor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Restore Pennsylvania&rdquo; plan.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

PennFuture strongly opposes Tohickon Creek downgrade,7/11/2019,"<p>On July 11, PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team submitted comments to the state Department of Environmental Protection, strongly urging the agency not to downgrade the status of the Tohickon Creek in Bucks County.</p>

<p>The creek, a tributary to the Delaware River, is a natural treasure and provides some of the best recreational opportunities in the area. In addition, the Tohickon Creek watershed sustains hundreds of species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates, many of which are considered rare or threatened.</p>

<p>In comments submitted to DEP, PennFuture attorney Abigail Jones wrote that redesignating waterbodies to a less-restrictive use essentially removes crucial water quality protections that keep those waterbodies clean and pure.</p>

<p>Redesignation, Jones wrote, &ldquo;is an extreme step to take under both federal and state law, and in the case of the lower Tohickon Creek, is inappropriate and unsupported.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DEP&rsquo;s proposal to redesignate the creek is even more confusing when history is factored in. In 1995, the Tinicum Conservancy submitted a petition to have the Tohickon redesignated as an &ldquo;exceptional value&rdquo; stream, the highest classification given to waterbodies.</p>

<p>Instead of considering that upgrade, DEP decided to do the exact opposite in proposing a redesignation that would knock the stream down a classification.</p>

<p>This is unacceptable to us at PennFuture, and unacceptable to many others in the area.</p>

"Artists Interpreting Climate Change, Part 3",6/26/2019,"<p>Last fall I wrote my first of <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-How-Artists-Interpret-Climate-Change-Raise-Awareness"">two blogs</a>on how artists are interpreting climate change, and what some artists are doing to prevent it. I continue to be amazed at the creative ways that artists of all types&mdash; painters, dancers, actors, writers, and musicians &mdash; tackle this issue in their work.</p>

<p>In my <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Artists-Interpreting-Climate-Change-Part-II"">second blog</a> I wrote about the environmental artist <a href=""http://www.stacylevy.com"">Stacy Levy</a>and the &ldquo;Tide Field&rdquo; installation of caterpillar-like buoys she created for the Schuylkill River. Levymakes projects that show how nature functions in an urban setting.</p>

<p>Her internationally-recognized art showcases the ways natural forces interact with human-made environments and urban ecosystems. She uses her projects to communicate environmental issues, primarily water-related, to the public. These installations often merge science and art that highlight the relationship between nature and the structures humans create. Not only does Levy garner attention with her art, but her constructions present creative solutions for environmental challenges.</p>

<p>If it isn&rsquo;t obvious, I have been a big fan of Levy&rsquo;s work for a while now, so I was absolutely thrilled when she was selected as PennFuture&rsquo;s first Woman of Environmental Arts at last April&rsquo;s 2019 <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2019/03/winners-of-women-in-conservation-awards.html"">Women in Conservation Awards Dinner</a>. PennFuture created The Woman of Environmental Arts Award to honor an individual who utilizes the arts &mdash; visual arts, music, poetry, fiction, theater, dance, as well as the curation or promotion of such arts &mdash; to bring attention to, or address current environmental concerns in Pennsylvania, and Levy was the perfect first recipient.</p>

<p>At the awards dinner Levy said the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so honored to be given this Penn Future award for Women in Conservation &mdash; it combines all that I hold dear: art and the environment. Art is not about decorating a place. It is about creating a connection to the place, a conduit of understanding and legibility. And art has a new role, a new function &mdash; art can be the next tool to help repair our damaged environments. It is important to give art a chance to solve issues about storm water drainage, rain infiltration and erosion. Engineers have had this job for years, but they have not always come up with sustainable answers. It is time to give art a place at the table for helping to solve environmental issues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most difficult challenges I&rsquo;ve seen artists face when dealing with climate change as a subject is how to make it informative without being didactic, accessible to a wide audience, and still make it an aesthetically interesting work of art.</p>

<p>Queens-based artist David Opdyke nailed all three with his installation, <a href=""http://davidopdyke.com"">&ldquo;This Land.&rdquo;</a> The piece had an incredible review in the New York Times last January when it debuted at The University of Michigan Institute for the Humanities in Ann Arbor, where Opdyke is the 2019 Efroymson Emerging Artist in Residence. (Disclosure: The Indianapolis-based Efroymson Family Fund, and one of its trustees, Jeremy Efroymson, have been generous past supporters of projects and organizations I was involved with while living in Indiana.)</p>

<p>The work consists of 528 vintage postcards of United States landmarks. They&rsquo;ve been arranged on a grid to create a landscape scene of mountains and a sunset that seems to be crumbling at the bottom &ndash; but when you zoom in you see that each card has been altered, painted with tornadoes, floods, lighting, sea creatures, forest fires, pipelines, traffic jams, deformed frogs, and a lot more &ndash; including blimps announcing that the end is near and advertising a modern-day Ark being built on the shores of Lake Huron &ndash; you get the point.</p>

<p>I strongly encourage you to take a look at it <a href=""http://davidopdyke.com"">here</a> and use your mouse to zoom in and out on the individual post cards. The work is in North Dakota right now and will be displayed at the Chicago Humanities Festival this fall. It is one of my favorite works that I have yet to see in person and I would love for it come to Pennsylvania sometime soon!</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;ve been interested in all types of artists, not just visual, and their work focused on environmental issues. And I&rsquo;m a big reader. So, I was excited to see that not just one, but two Pennsylvania authors have recently penned such stories with Susquehanna River as their setting.</p>

<p>The first is <a href=""http://www.brooklenker.com"">Brook Lenker</a>, who has worked in many environmental jobs including at the PA DCNR and Dauphin County Parks and Rec., and was a founder of the Susquehanna River Trail Association. His book &ldquo;The Restorers&rdquo; is a literary river adventure that mixes a bit of Kerouac and Twain with some Carl Hiaasen. The main character, Reily Watters, is on a 556-mile kayak expedition on the Susquehanna wen confronted with a real estate development threatening the river.</p>

<p>Author <a href=""http://joelburcat.com"">Joel Burcat</a>,also an environmental lawyer, wrote the polluted-water legal thriller, &ldquo;Drink to Every Beast.&rdquo; His lead character is PA DEP prosecutor Mike Jacobs. The book is built around his investigation of the death of two teenagers who swam through chemicals illegally dumped into the Susquehanna. I just got my copy and can&rsquo;t wait to dive in.</p>

<p>Also on my personal stack of books to read this summer is Richard Powers&rsquo; novel of environmental activism, &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.richardpowers.net/the-overstory"">The Overstory,</a>&rdquo; which recently won the Pulitzer Prize. (I hear that PennFuture&rsquo;s Director of Policy, Ezra Thrush, is reading it too this summer.) Author Ann Patchett has said that it is&ldquo;the best novel ever written about trees, and really, just one of the best novels, period.&rdquo; That sounds pretty good to me, but it was the rave review I heard from my mother-in-law and my wife (both artists as well), who have recently read it, that sold me. Please, no spoilers!</p>

<p>Creatively exploring environmental issues is not limited to individual artists and writers. The Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh is hosting its first &ldquo;<a href=""http://cmoa.org/event/breathe-better-day"">Breathe Better Day</a>&rdquo; on July 13th to celebrate air quality awareness through art-based lectures and family-friendly activities. Their exhibit Monet and the Modern City will be the basis of learning how artists in the past responded to the rise of industry, and polluted air, when they painted urban industrial landscapes. Wow! As far as I know this is the first museum effort to explore environmental issues and climate change by re-examining art of the past instead of contemporary work. What a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>Speaking of institutions, Hollywood has also made a (mixed) effort at exploring climate change. There is actually a whole category of films now referred to as &ldquo;Cli-Fi.&rdquo; My good friend <a href=""http://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/03/climate-change-in-the-movies-in-2018"">Michael Svoboda</a> has written a number of thoughtful articles about this. I&rsquo;ll only add, and I&rsquo;m certainly not the first to do so, that the most popular movie of the summer, <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, is essentially a movie about (no spoilers, I promise) the dangerous consequences of a ridiculously extreme environmental agenda but with no true solutions offered. In spite of this I really enjoyed it, as long as I didn&rsquo;t think too much about it.</p>

<p>What exhibits, books, movies or music have you experienced lately that creatively examine climate change and other environmental issue? I&rsquo;d love to hear from you!

The Importance of Agriculture to Clean Water,6/21/2019,"<p>The recent completion of the Pennsylvania draft Phase 3 Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) marks a crossroads for water quality in our local rivers and streams. The WIP &mdash; which more than 100 stakeholders in federal, state, and local governments, as well as non-governmental and governmental agencies, and citizens of Pennsylvania developed through countless hours of research, outreach, and strategic engagement &mdash; outlines how Pennsylvania will work to clean up local waterways.</p>

<p>While the WIP does not meet the pollution reductions necessary to meet Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nitrogen and phosphorus goals, it does meet the pollution requirements necessary for sediment reduction. However, there is a major price tag to fully implement the WIP as it is currently written: as much as $257 million annually, which the state is unlikely to provide.</p>

<p>Four of the top five pollution reduction practices come from the agricultural sector, including agriculture compliance ($33.1 million), soil health ($32.9 million), grass buffers ($9.2 million), and forested buffers ($41.4 million). With over 33,000 farms located in the Pennsylvania portion of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, it cannot be overstated how critical a role agriculture will play in the restoration of our local rivers and streams.</p>

<p>In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s established a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), which mandates a specific amount of pollution that can flow into our waterways by means of stormwater, wastewater, and agricultural runoff. Pennsylvania is drastically far behind in achieving our TMDL, and it is more important than ever for clean water and environmental organizations like PennFuture to work alongside agriculture interest groups to clean up local rivers and streams.</p>

<p>Public outreach and education will be the key to meeting our pollution reduction goal. PennFuture is working with other environmental organizations and agriculture groups to increase the use of best management practices, such as cover crops and no-till farming.</p>

<p>Cover crops are used primarily to slow erosion, improve soil health, enhance water availability, smother weeds, help control pests and diseases, increase biodiversity and bring a host of other benefits. Cover crops also reduce runoff, add organic matter to the soil, and increase resilience in the face of erratic and increasingly intensive rainfall, as well as under drought conditions.</p>

<p>No-till farming leaves the soil mostly untouched, which increases levels of crop residue left behind and nearly eliminates soil erosion. No-till also drastically increases water infiltration, which results in less runoff of contaminated water as well as reduces the amount of water needed for crops.</p>

<p>Like most things, conservation practices come at a cost. New equipment to implement best management practices and planting buffers is expensive. And with 6,000 farms closed between 2012 and 2017 due to retirement and declining income, many of which were mid-sized family farms, it is easy to see why there is such hesitancy to adopt new practices. Successfully engaging and building trust within the agriculture community, and increasing the amount of farmers using conservation practices such as cover crops and no-tll,will lead to increased yield, improved soil health, and improved local waterways.</p>

<p>The time has come for environmental organizations and agriculture groups to work together to address these issues. We must build trust and alliances within the agricultural community by increasing outreach and public engagement. We must also continue to advocate for increased water quality protection, while simultaneously addressing funding mechanisms to get farmers the resources necessary to implement conservation practices so they can continue to be stewards of their land.</p>

<p>Clean water and agriculture interest groups can&rsquo;t restore our waterways individually. Our groups must work together to fully achieve our pollution reduction goals, and it will not be easy. But if we want our children and future generations to enjoy the beauty of our rivers and streams, it is more important than ever to work together.</p>

A Look at the 2018 Draft Integrated Water Quality Report,6/17/2019,"<p>Pennsylvania is a water rich state with approximately 86,000 stream miles connecting more than 700,000 acres of lakes, bays, and wetlands. Protecting and monitoring such a high volume of the Commonwealths waterways is a challengingbut necessary task.</p>

<p>On June 4, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) closed its public comment period for the 2018 Draft Integrated Water Quality Report (IWQR). You can view the IWQR draft and find your local water body by following <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/CleanWater/WaterQuality/IntegratedWatersReport/Pages/2018-Integrated-Water-Quality-Report.aspx"">this link</a>. These reports are required to be submitted every other year (even numbered years) to comply with two sections of the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act"">U.S. Clean Water Act</a> that require states to report on the overall condition of their aquatic resources and develop a list of all impaired waters in order to prioritize restoration efforts. Pennsylvania is over a year late in preparing its 2018 report. These reports are submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval. PennFuture has submitted comments on this report which can be viewed <a href=""/Files/News/20190603-PF-2018-Integrated-Report-comments.pdf"">here</a>.</p>

<p>This year, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s draft IWQR has been transformed into a fully digital and online interactive program. Users now have access to numerous maps that show water quality in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s <a href=""https://padep-1.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=9bd2f843c4a44bb1a8ae0d024c66675f"">rivers and streams</a> as well as <a href=""https://padep-1.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=075db9e22ad74546bd5439cc469b1b16"">bays, wetlands, and lakes</a>.</p>

<p>Through these maps, PA DEP can explain why waterways in PA have or have not been determined to be &ldquo;impaired.&rdquo; If a stream or other body of water is determined to be impaired, it is required that the state design a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to restore the water quality for that specific waterbody. According to the EPA, a TMDL is a regulatory term identifying the maximum amount of a pollutant that a body of water can receive while still meeting water quality standards.</p>

<p>The next IWQR will be released in Spring 2020. Besides these reports there are more opportunities to make your voice heard. It is essential for the public to participate when there are rule-making comment opportunities. Public comments strengthen regulations, create a comprehensive and accurate record, and support an appropriate and informed decision-making process. Written public comments can be as short or in-depth as the submitter chooses, but here are a few tips and techniques from PennFuture that can help make comments effective:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use specific examples and highlight how the regulations could impact you, your family, your community, and the natural resources you love.</li>
	<li>Use persuasive language throughout.</li>
	<li>Present your comments in a clear, concise, and respectful manner.</li>

"PennFuture Submits Comments Opposing the Dirty Water Rule, Engages More Than 1,400 Citizens to Do the Same",4/18/2019,"<p>On Monday, April 15, PennFuture submitted public comments opposing the Trump Administration&rsquo;s proposed revised definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; under the Clean Water Act. The proposed definition &ndash; the Dirty Water Rule as we like to call it &ndash; would be the single biggest rollback of Clean Water Act protections since its creation in 1972.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s comments opposing the Dirty Water Rule can be found <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/files/admin/2019_04_15-PennFuture-WOTUS-Public-Comments-EPA-HQ-OW-2018-0149.pdf"" target=""“_blank”"">here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, PennFuture engaged more than 1,400 people, each of whom submitted comments opposing the proposed gutting of the Clean Water Act. Nationally, more than 300,000 people submitted comments.</p>

<p>Since taking office in 2017, President Trump has made the attack on the 2015 Clean Water Rule a priority for his administration. The 2015 Clean Water Rule clarified the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s jurisdiction and reduced uncertainty, as well as protected critical waters throughout Pennsylvania and across America.</p>

<p>PennFuture strongly supported the promulgation of the Clean Water Rule because it was supported by the legislative history of the Clean Water Act, it would protect drinking water supplies used by millions of Pennsylvanians, and it would protect sensitive and critical headwaters and wetlands, which, in turn, protect the water quality for thousands of stream miles in the Commonwealth. The Clean Water Rule also relied on a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; test to determine jurisdiction of certain waters. The significant nexus test recognized the importance of biological, chemical, and physical influence of waters as a basis of Clean Water Act protections.</p>

<p>In contrast, the proposed Dirty Water Rule is not based on science at all but is a capitulation to big industry interests, making it easier for them to pollute our nation&rsquo;s waters. The Dirty Water Rule is based on an extremely limited dictionary definition of the term &ldquo;water,&rdquo; which was taken to mean only relatively permanent standing or flowing waters. Additionally, the term &ldquo;adjacent wetlands&rdquo; was restricted to mean only those wetlands that physically touch or have a direct hydrological surface connection to other &ldquo;waters of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Consequently, the proposed Dirty Water Rule would eliminate protections for some of our most critical waters, especially wetlands and ephemeral (rain dependent) streams. These waters provide numerous benefits for local wildlife and ecology and provide the clean water source for many of our drinking water systems. For this and the other reasons set forth in our comments, PennFuture strongly opposed the Dirty Water Rule as a dire threat to the significant progress we have made under the Clean Water Act toward restoring and conserving our nation&rsquo;s waters.</p>

<p>While this was the final step in the &ldquo;repeal and replace&rdquo; of the 2015 Clean Water Rule&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; (see <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Opposes-Any-Repeal-of-the-Clean-Water-Rule"" target=""“_blank”"">here</a> for PennFuture&rsquo;s comments on the repeal stage), the proposed Dirty Water Rule must be finalized by the federal agencies after reviewing and responding to all the comments. PennFuture anticipates a flurry of litigation to follow finalization of the Dirty Water Rule, and we will keep you posted about what happens next.</p>

New Definition of “Waters of the United States” Threatens Clean Water Act Protections,3/26/2019,"<p>On February 14, 2019, the federal agencies tasked with regulating our nation&rsquo;s waters under the Clean Water Act &ndash; the US Environmental Protection Agency and US Army Corps of Engineers &ndash; issued a new definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States,&rdquo; which will dramatically limit the protections of the Clean Water Act.</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-02-14/pdf/2019-00791.pdf"" target=""“_blank”"">proposed rule</a>, aptly nicknamed the &ldquo;Dirty Water Rule,&rdquo; would, among other things, remove federal protections from ephemeral waters (those that flow only in response to precipitation events) and those wetlands that lack a direct physical or surface hydrological connection to protected waters. These waters are important not only for their own ecological roles, but they are critical for providing cleaner water downstream. Nationally, approximately <a href=""https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/12/epa-claims-no-data-impact-weakening-water-rule-numbers-exist"" target=""“_blank”"">18% of our nation&rsquo;s streams and over half of the wetlands</a> could lose federal protections under the Dirty Water Rule. More concerning is that the federal government has <i>no idea</i> what the impacts will be to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s water resources!</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s most alarming about the Dirty Water Rule is that the gutting of the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s protections is <i>not based in either science or the law</i>. Rather, it is a capitulation to big industry, making it easier for them to pollute some of our most critical headwaters and wetlands. The Dirty Water Rule will jeopardize over 40 years of successes under the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s mandate to protect the biological, chemical, and physical integrity of our nation&rsquo;s waters.</p>

D.C. Visit Marks Success for the Chesapeake Bay,3/15/2019,"<p>PennFuture and clean water advocates from across Pennsylvania teamed up on March 6 for the annual <a href=""https://www.choosecleanwater.org/""><u><strong>Choose Clean Water Coalition (CCWC) </strong></u></a> Chesapeake Bay Day on the Hill.</p>

<p>Our mission was to advocate for increased funding for vital legislation that would improve water quality across the Bay watershed. Federal programs, such as the Chesapeake Small Watershed Grants (SWG) and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), provide critical financial resources that help local governments and farmers reduce pollution flowing into our waterways. At the Capitol, we asked our congressional representatives to ensure that local governments receive the funds they need to meet pollution reduction goals by: increasing Chesapeake Bay Program Funding, substantially increasing funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF), and fully funding the conservation programs in the Farm Bill in fiscal year 2020.</p>

<p>Chesapeake Bay Program grants such as the SWG and the Innovative Nutrient Sediment Reduction Grants (INSR) provide critical on-the-ground restoration at the local level. By increasing funding levels the Bay Program receives, additional resources can be allocated toward local communities and non-profit organizations to improve local water quality. These additional funds are necessary for Pennsylvania to meet its 2025 Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirement, which is a pollution limit all states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed must meet.</p>

<p>Additionally, we asked our Congressional delegation to substantially increase funding for the SRF, and include it in any future Federal Infrastructure Spending Plan. The Clean Water SRF is an essential piece of funding that provides low interest loans to local governments for clean water infrastructure projects to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution for wastewater treatment and stormwater facilities, and nonpoint sources of pollution such as farms and developments.</p>

<p>Finally, the CCWC team asked for support to fully fund the conservation programs in the Farm Bill in fiscal year 2020.

<p>Among the many decision makers who represent districts in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, we met with Pennsylvania Representatives Lloyd Smucker, John Joyce, Scott Perry, Glenn &ldquo;G.T.&rdquo; Thompson, and Matt Cartwright and their staffs, each of whom carefully listened to our concerns. Finally, we also had the honor of meeting with Senator Bob Casey, who introduced legislation that became the CREP section of the Farm Bill, which will help farmers and landowners install more riparian forest buffers and maintain them.</p>
