Introducing PennFuture's New Fall Term Legal Interns!,10/4/2024,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania's environment and ""create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.""</p><p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p><p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognize that we need to be more involved with cultivating the people that will continue to support our mission. Our staff have a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.<br /> With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment.</p><p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting Pennsylvania as well as to further their potential environmental careers. We've seen success on this front as many of our legal interns have found work in the Pennsylvania environmental legal space. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.</p><p>Over the past four years, our interns have made it possible for PennFuture's legal team to do more, faster, and better! They have supported our litigation efforts against water polluters and fracked-gas facilities, they have drafted comments in support of stronger regulatory protections across the Commonwealth, and they have helped our attorneys strategize and execute impactful legal actions. We are grateful for all of the hard work, passion, and dedication of our legal interns.<br /> This summer, we have three fantastic students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We've asked our new interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture's mission means to them:</p><h3><img class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/VeronicPorter.jpg"" /><strong>Veronic Porter, Third Year student at Widener University Commonwealth Law</strong></h3><p>When I was a child I loved to be outdoors and loved helping any animal I came across. It was for this love for the environment and wildlife that I knew from a young age that I wanted to do my part in helping to protect and conserve the environment.</p><p>It was this passion that drove me to obtain my undergraduate major in Environmental Science and Policy from the University of South Florida. From courses taken in my undergraduate education and from my strong passion to protect the environment, I was motivated to attend Widener University Commonwealth Law School with the hopes to pursue a career in Environmental Law after graduation. At Widener University Commonwealth Law School, I am a member of the Animal Legal Defense Fund and I am pursuing a Certificate in Environmental Law.</p><p>I was drawn to apply as an Intern with PennFuture because I related to PennFutures' dedication to protecting the environment and fighting for sustainable communities for generations to come. I also really admired PennFutures' efforts to educate and outreach to citizens in Pennsylvania to help empower them to fight for change in our communities.</p><p>Interning with PennFuture has given me the ability to expand my knowledge in Environmental Law by sharpening my research and writing skills as well as providing me with opportunities to learn first-hand about the litigation process surrounding current Environmental issues affecting Pennsylvania residents. PennFuture has solidified that Environmental Law is the field of law that I want to go into and has given me the opportunity to work with an organization that prioritizes advancing an environmentally friendly and sustainable community.</p><h3><strong><img class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/Jeremy%2DZimmerman%5F05%5F4x6.jpg"" />Jeremy Zimmerman, Second Year student at Penn State Dickinson Law</strong></h3><p>Growing up in Lancaster County, I have seen drastic changes in our local environment as forests and farms have been turned into parking lots and strip malls time and time again. Growing up in such a dynamic environment piqued my interest at a young age into environmental issues and political issues in my local community.</p><p>These two passions guided my educational journey, enrolling in a dual degree program which coalesced my interests. I received a Bachelor of Arts from the Paris Institute of Political Science and a second bachelors degree from Columbia University in Sustainable Development. I never lost sight of home though, for my senior honors thesis I examined the socio-economic impacts of hydraulic fracturing on Pennsylvanias Northern Tier and continued to be involved with local issues.</p><p>After undergrad I joined my municipalitys Sustainable Advisory Committee and became a technical consultant for the private sector helping businesses to achieve and keep compliance with environmental regulations. For two and a half years I inspected factories, collected field samples, wrote reports, and gave staff trainings to help ensure businesses were keeping our environment clean.</p><p>It was ultimately this exposure to environmental regulations that sparked my interest in the law and led me to attend Penn State Dickinson Law where I am currently in my second year. I am tremendously excited to be at PennFuture where all of my passions in life- the environment, Pennsylvania, and the law come together!</p>",Environment,"Abigail M.

What You Need to Know About Being a Poll Worker,9/24/2024,"<p>Your community needs you! By serving as a poll worker, you will ensure that the voting process runs smoothly on Election Day. Its an excellent opportunity to connect with your neighbors and play a vital role in the democratic process. Regular citizens who volunteer as poll workers are passionate about civic engagement and get firsthand participation in the inner workings of our electoral system.</p><p><strong>PennFuture's Managing Attorney for Litigation Jessica O'Neill</strong> shares her experience as an election worker for the past 8 years and <strong>PennFuture's Advocacy Manager Michael Mehrazar</strong> shares his background as a poll worker trainer below.</p><p>But first, please review the Pennsylvania poll worker criteria:</p><p><br /><strong>Q. Who can be a poll worker?</strong><br /> There are a few requirements to becoming a poll worker in PA.</p><ul><li>Generally, poll workers must be registered voters in their county.</li><li>Must not hold any public office, appointment or employment in the government.</li><li>Must not be a candidate running for public office on the ballot in precinct (exceptions for Judge and Inspector of elections).</li><li>Must be completely non-partisan while serving in the precinct (not campaigning, handing out literature or wearing political items), and must work to keep the rest of the room where voting occurs a ""campaign free zone."" The ""campaign free zone"" in the polling place is to ensure that voters are free to cast ballots without influence or intimidation.</li><li>You must be patient and a good listener for those showing up to cast a ballot.</li></ul><p>*Special skills like language interpretation or ASL fluency are critical to making the polls and voting as accessible as possible for all.</p><p><strong>Q. I am under 18 years old. Can I be a poll worker?</strong><br /> It varies by location. To check to see if your location accepts student poll workers, please enter your zip code here: <a href=""https://powerthepolls.com/search"">https://powerthepolls.com/search</a></p><p><strong>Q. How do I apply to be a poll worker?</strong><br /> You can submit your interest at this link: <a href=""https://powerthepolls.com/cvpa&pf"">https://powerthepolls.com/cvpa&pf</a></p><p><strong>Q. When is the deadline to apply to be a poll worker?</strong><br /> Most election administrators accept applications on a rolling basis. Once you submit your interest, your county or jurisdiction will reach out to you on dates for training.</p><p><strong>Q. Do I need to go through specific poll worker training?</strong><br /> Yes. Local jurisdictions can host both in-person and online training events ahead of Election Day and will fully prepare you for your shift. For example, in Pittsburgh, training typically lasts up to 2 hours for new poll workers.</p><p><strong>Q. What specific dutiesare available to poll workers?</strong></p><p>The jobs will depend on the county. For example, in <a href=""https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Poll-Workers"">Allegheny County</a>, you can be assigned as Judge of Election, Inspector, or Clerk of Election depending on your skill set.</p><p><strong>Q. Will I get paid to be a poll worker?</strong><br /> Many jurisdictions in PA provide compensation for poll workers on election day and for training. Compensation varies by jurisdiction and you can review by submitting your zip code here https://www.powerthepolls.org/search<br /> For example, in Philadelphia, a poll worker who works the full day can receive $200 to $205 for Election Day, and $30 to $50 for training.</p><p><strong>Q. When do polls open and close?</strong><br /> In Pennsylvania, the polls open at 7:00 am and close at 8:00 pm.</p><hr /><h2><strong>I'M A POLL WORKER</strong></h2><p><strong><img class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/Jessica.jpg"" /></strong></p><p><strong>Q. Why did you want to be a poll worker?</strong></p><p>In the 2016 general election, my polling place was overwhelmed with 3+ hour-long lines to vote. The neighborhoods population had changed, and many more voters would vote that year using antiquated voting machines and procedures. The few poll workers just couldnt keep up. They were doing their best, but it was just too much.</p><p>I watched potential voters leave the lines because they were so long. I vowed to get involved to make sure that even if I couldnt fix the infrastructure problems, I could help use my skills to make things more efficient and secure and ensure no one would ever walk out of a polling line again.</p><p><strong>Q. What was your poll worker training like? How long was your training?</strong></p><p>In Philadelphia County, there is in-person and online training. I recommend doing both if you can (both are about a half hour long). Many of the other poll workers will have a lot of experience - talk to them to learn how everything works! Make sure that you show up an hour before voting begins so you can have time to get the polling place set up and get ready.</p><p><strong>Q. On election day, when did you show up to your shift and how long did you work?</strong></p><p>There are no shifts - get ready for a long day! I show up an hour before polls open, which is usually at 5:45 am. As the judge of elections, I am bringing some of the election materials from the county with me, and I want to be there first to be ready to greet my workers.</p><p>There is a lot to do to set up the polling place, so we launch right into it. I appreciate having poll workers who are willing to just get straight to work even if they have never worked an election before. There are many set up tasks that anyone can do with a little direction!</p><p>Polls open in Pennsylvania from 7 am to 8 pm. Anyone who is still in line at 8 pm can vote, and we do not start closing the polls until after 8 pm even if there is no one in line. I usually can excuse my poll workers by 9 pm, but if there is a line, then we are all there longer.</p><p>As the judge of elections, I am responsible for the election materials. A police officer comes and picks up the ballots sometime after 8 pm, and I am responsible for bringing other election materials back to the board of elections after we are all closed up.</p><p><strong>Q. What did you wear?</strong></p><p>Comfortable clothing is a must! Supportive footwear and layers, as the temperature will change a lot through the day depending on how many people are in line in the room! No shirts or other attire supporting a candidate is allowed. I always wear a pin that says ""Vote!"" and I have another poll worker with amazing ""go vote!"" socks.</p><p><strong>Q. Are you allowed to bring anything with you / should you bring something with you (ie. lunch, a book)?</strong></p><p>You may get a break so it's a good idea to bring a book or magazine. In Philadelphia, there are various organizations that try to make sure that meals are provided to poll workers throughout the day. It often ends up being a bunch of donuts in the morning and a pizza at dinner. Different counties might have different procedures on meals.</p><p><strong>Q. How would you describe your poll worker job on election day? What were your specific tasks?</strong></p><p>As the judge of elections, I manage the entire polling place. I ensure that the poll books are correct, that the machines are working, and that my poll workers understand and can do their jobs.</p><p>I also make sure that election laws are followed - that folks distributing campaign literature stay the appropriate number of feet outside the polling place, that no voter is being harassed or intimidated, and that election watchers are permitted as provided by law and are following the rules.</p><p>Most importantly, though, my job is ensuring registered voters can cast their ballots! If they need to show ID, I make sure they understand why and help them meet the requirements under the law. If they are at the wrong polling place, I help them figure out what polling place they are supposed to be at and make sure they know where to find it. Suppose they aren't permitted to vote on the voting machines (for example, they were issued a mail-in ballot or their name isn't in the poll book). In that case, I make sure they understand why, give them the provisional ballot and the receipt, and follow the appropriate steps to get that provisional ballot in.</p><p>My goal is for a registered, eligible voter coming into the polling place can walk out trusting the electoral system and be confident that their vote will be counted.</p><p><strong>Q. Did any problems occur that you helped to solve?</strong></p><p>Countless! It's what I do all day long.</p><p><strong>Q. What did you like about your job as a poll worker?</strong></p><p>I like knowing my neighbors and knowing that they know me as a trustworthy person who helps them vote. My favorite moments throughout the day are when someone brings in their 18-year-old kid to vote for the first time: someone yells out, ""First-time voter!"" and all the poll workers cheer and applaud.</p><p>I also have a voter in his 90s who never misses an election, and I get such a kick out of seeing him come in and cast his ballot. My work is a bright spot that makes me feel good about our democracy.</p><hr /><h2><strong>I WAS A POLL WORKER TRAINER</strong></h2><p><strong><img class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/Michael.jpg"" />Q. Why did you want to be a poll worker?</strong></p><p>Ever since childhood, I have been fascinated by the electoral process. I vividly remember my dad taking me into the polling booth when I was eight. This early experience sparked my interest, and it should be no surprise that I went on to study political science in college.</p><p>Soon after graduating, I applied for and was fortunate to receive a job at the Anne Arundel County Board of Elections in Maryland. I was honored to secure a position so closely involved with the administration of our electoral system just after completing my studies. This experience helped me lead the way to future electoral and government work, including my role as Advocacy Manager at PennFuture today.</p><p><strong>Q. What was your poll worker training like? How long was your training?</strong></p><p>I was hired as a trainer to help train citizens interested in becoming Election Judges. Our training program consisted of an intensive two-week overview of all aspects of electoral laws and procedures in Maryland. This involved lectures, written components, and hands-on familiarity with the various election equipment.</p><p>After the initial training, we spent another two weeks manually reviewing the voting machines to catch any potential flaws or issues. (2014 was the last election in which Maryland used a touchscreen voting system rather than the more secure paper record voting system. <a href=""https://elections.maryland.gov/voting_system/learn_about_the_new_voting_system.html"">More information here</a>)<br /> We would then spend the remaining time leading up to the election training citizens to become certified election judges. Following the election, we spent several weeks completing the necessary post-election work, including ballot counting, post-operation review, and other administrative tasks.</p><p>The training sessions we ran typically lasted around 2 hours. During these sessions, we would review the election judge manual, review the various judge roles (check-in judge, voter judge, provisional judge, and chief judge), and cover the opening procedures, during-the-day procedures, and closing procedures. We would also incorporate role-playing exercises to help prepare the judges.</p><p>Overall, I believe our judges were well-trained and equipped to handle their responsibilities on election day.</p><p><strong>Q. Any question that you recommend new poll workers ask during training?</strong></p><p>I suggest reading ahead of time to ensure you have a sense of the basic procedure during the training. Try to inquire about any potential edge cases or nuances that may arise on Election Day. Id also recommend asking questions about the measures in place to secure the voting process, as many unfounded concerns are circulating about election integrity, and it would be great to know the accurate information to help mitigate those fears.</p><p><strong>Q. On election day, when did you show up to your shift and how long did you work?</strong></p><p>As a trainer, my role on election day was to observe multiple polling places and ensure proper procedures were followed. I was also on call in case any serious issues arose. My day began at 6:00 am and did not end until close to midnight, as I was responsible for processing all the materials, including the computer cards that held the votes.</p><p>For most polling workers, however, the day typically started about half an hour before the polls opened and ended about half an hour after the polls closed (roughly 6:30 am to 8:30 pm).</p><p><strong>Q. What did you wear?</strong></p><p>We had a uniform, which included a black polo and khakis. I don't think most places have a specific dress code for election judges, but I'm not sure. Whatever you wear, make sure it's comfortable - it's a long day!</p><p><strong>Q. Are you allowed to bring anything with you / should you bring something with you (ie. lunch, a book)?</strong></p><p>I believe you're allowed to bring food. Books would be fine too, as long as they weren't political in nature or in favor of any of the candidates. I would certainly ask your trainers.</p><p><strong>Q. How would you describe your poll worker job on election day? What were your specific tasks?</strong></p><p>Back in 2014 in Maryland, there were four different poll worker roles:</p><ul><li>Check-in Judges: These judges check voters names against the registration list to verify they were at the correct polling location. They would also help direct voters to the appropriate polling place or inform them if they needed to cast a provisional ballot.</li><li>Voting Judges: These judges would guide voters to the voting machines and assist them with any questions or issues they encounter during the voting process.</li><li>Provisional Judges: These judges would staff the provisional ballot station, handling ballots for voters who faced eligibility issues that prevented them from casting a regular ballot. If the voters eligibility was later confirmed within the allotted time frame (typically 10 days), their provisional ballot would be counted.</li><li>Chief Judges: The chief judges were responsible for managing the overall operations of the polling place. Typically, they are election day veterans, having run many elections before. They are required to be bipartisan, with one Democrat and one Republican serving together. On election night, the chief judges would also be tasked with delivering the voting equipment to the Board of Elections.</li></ul><p><strong>Q. Did any problems occur that you helped to solve?</strong></p><p>Yes, there were various logistical issues, such as signs not being placed in the right locations, people campaigning too close to the polling places, and check-in computers needing to be fixed. No matter how much training is provided, things rarely go perfectly on election day.</p><p><strong>Q. What did you like about your job as a poll worker?</strong></p><p>Besides the camaraderie I had with my team, I found it fascinating to learn about the significant behind-the-scenes efforts that go into securing our elections. These efforts, often unnoticed by the general public, involve numerous security measures such as tamper-evident seals, serial number matching, locked bags, and the presence of bipartisan poll watchers. This learning experience has deepened my understanding of the integrity and fairness of our elections.</p><hr /><p>Still interested in becoming a poll worker?

Kidder Township Adopts PennFuture Model Logistics Ordinance Over Objections of Distribution Center Developer,9/16/2024,"<p><img class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/Route%2D940%2DKidder%2DTwp%2DWarehouse%284%29.jpg"" />Kidder Township is the quintessential Poconos community. It is home to Hickory Run State Park, Jack Frost and Big Boulder ski resorts, Lake Harmony, thousands of acres of state game land, and countless Special Protection waters and wetlands, including the headwaters of the Lehigh River. But, in recent years, residents have witnessed an unwelcome shift in the landscape. It began in 2023 with the construction of a 1.1 million square foot distribution center that converted 45 acres of woodland in the Lehigh River watershed to impervious surface. Later that year, the Township approved a second massive distribution center along the same road. Within weeks of that approval, the Township received plans for a third project, a 420,000 square foot warehouse across the road from the first building that would pave over an additional 46 acres of forest.</p><p>With no end to the destruction of their precious natural resources in sight, Kidder Township residents sprung into action. Local advocacy groups LOVE Kidder Township and Save Carbon County rallied concerned community members to stop the unrestrained development of massive logistics facilities. They waded into the complex world of local and state land use approval processes and organized members to attend meetings and communicate their concerns to local and state decision-makers. They engaged an engineer to review the most recent warehouse proposal and identify key environmental issues. Most importantly, they did not just offer resistance and antagonism-they offered solutions.</p><p>As LOVE Kidder Township and Save Carbon County quickly realized, the explosion of massive logistics facilities in Kidder Township was facilitated by the Township's overly-permissive zoning ordinance. Under the existing ordinance, warehouses, distribution centers, and truck terminals (as these types of facilities are variously called) were all allowed as permitted uses in the Township's commercial and business/light industrial zoning districts. Few, if any, restrictions applied to these uses beyond basic lot size and setback requirements. The absence of more stringent requirements or a public review process meant that Township officials had little ability to reign in massive logistics development, even if they and the residents wanted to. The advocacy groups came to understand that, if residents and the Township wanted more say in what was built in their community, they needed more robust zoning regulations. For help in crafting those regulations, Kidder Township residents turned to PennFuture.</p><p>Through the advocacy of LOVE Kidder Township and Save Carbon County, <a href=""/files/galleries/PennFuture_Ordinance_Manual_7.pdf""><em>Living with Logistics</em></a>, PennFuture's model logistics use ordinance and guidebook, became the blueprint for Kidder Township's reconsideration of its zoning ordinance, and on September 12, 2024, the Board of Supervisors adopted a zoning ordinance amendment that imposes new, more appropriate restrictions based on PennFuture's model.</p><p><img class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/Route%2D940%2DKidder%2DTwp%2DWarehouse%281%29.jpg"" /><strong>Perhaps the most significant change to the Kidder Township zoning ordinance is that all logistics uses are now conditional uses and allowed only in the Business Development/Light Industrial District.</strong> Designating these uses as conditional uses instead of allowing them ""by-right"" means that applicants will now have to prove, at a public hearing before the Board of Supervisors, that their proposed warehouse/distribution center/truck terminal satisfies the requirements of the zoning ordinance. These hearings will also provide an opportunity for the public to question applicants about their proposals and, if they so desire, to present their own evidence. The conditional use process also allows the Board of Supervisors to impose conditions upon approval, an option that is not available for ""by-right"" uses.</p><p>Kidder Township's new ordinance also adopts many of the other provisions suggested in PennFuture's model. For example, using language provided by PennFuture, the ordinance prohibits the removal of more than 50% of the woodland on any given site, creates riparian buffers, requires developers to submit Environmental Impact Statements, and obligates developers of high traffic-volume facilities to provide overnight parking and other driver facilities. Township officials also made changes to the model ordinance language as they saw fit, as was entirely appropriate. For example, the Township reduced the suggested building setbacks and opted to forgo language offering developers credit for using impervious pavement.</p><p>The path to adoption was not without obstacles. Blue Ridge Real Estate (BRRE), the entity that developed the existing 1.1 million square-foot distribution center and seeks approval for a second facility across the street (and owns dozens of additional parcels in the Township) vehemently opposed the ordinance amendment. Realizing that the ordinance amendment would spell the end of relatively unconstrained warehouse and distribution center development, BRRE incorrectly branded the amendment as unconstitutional and erroneously claimed that it would render some of its properties undevelopable. The Board of Supervisors was not swayed by these scare tactics, however, and concluded that the new ordinance strikes an appropriate balance between the Township's economic interests and protecting its sensitive environmental areas.</p><p>As LOVE Kidder Township and Save Carbon County have shown, residents who join together and present solutions to local environmental concerns can make big changes in the shape of their community. Kidder Township now joins the growing number of municipalities to adopt PennFuture's model ordinance or portions thereof, including Palmer Township, Northampton County, and Coolbaugh Township, Monroe County.

Shifting the Paradigm for a Sustainable Pennsylvania Economy,8/12/2024,"<p>Climate change is the greatest existential threat to humanity and the worst market failure of our time. Economic volatility and environmental degradation are inherent to the fossil industries, whose greenhouse gas emissions caused the climate crisis that impacts us today. Pennsylvania has been uniquely impacted as these extractive industries established a dysfunctional economy driven by boom and bust cycles, which leads to instability and uncertainty for workers and communities across the state. This situation is unsustainable.</p><p>How do we transition Pennsylvania to clean energy sources after centuries of dependence upon fossil fuels? What would the necessary transition and resulting economy look like?</p><p>First, lets explore the notions of sustainability and sustainable economics.</p><h3><strong>What is ""sustainability""?</strong></h3><p>""Enough for everyone forever"" is considered the guiding principle of sustainability. The concept demands that we meet the needs of now without sacrificing future generations quality of life and opportunities. It is both a challenge and a hopeful sentiment of what is possible. It is something enshrined in <a href=""/environmental-rights-amendment"">our constitutional environmental rights as Pennsylvanians</a> and something to fight for.</p><p><img class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/Sustainability%2DCompass.jpg"" /></p><p>According to sustainability expert Alan AtKisson: ""Sustainability is a concept, a way of thinking, a way of analyzing and understanding"" (<a href=""https://sforeveryone.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sustainability-is-for-everyone-alan-atkisson.pdf"">Sustainability is for Everyone</a>). It includes two important aspects - (1) long-term thinking and (2) systems thinking. Long-term thinking requires careful consideration of data, information, and trends with a specific plan or goal in mind. It requires us to have a vision. This thinking differs significantly from the short-term, profit-driven motivations driving our economy. While the sustainability framework asks, ""Will this help us to have enough for everyone forever,"" our current economic approach instead asks, ""Will this maximize profits for shareholders now?""</p><p>Systems thinking acknowledges the connectedness of sustainability. Our society and economic well-being rely upon complex and nuanced systems - planetary ecosystems and the economy - which we tend to collapse and oversimplify. We have learned to separate economies from ecosystems as if our lives do not depend upon both. One provides income, goods, and services. The other includes air, water, and food. Inevitably, the choices made and actions taken in one of these realms impact other parts and functions of the system. Analyzing data and considering trade-offs carefully provides opportunities to mitigate the severity of any potential consequences, like pollution or economic volatility. It ultimately allows us to make more informed choices.</p><p>One final piece of the sustainability puzzle is diversity, which enhances resilience amid shocks and disruptions. For example, when a local economy relies upon a single industry - like a coal-fired power plant - and that industry collapses, so does the community. Consequently, that community is hard-pressed to bounce back after such a shock and economic loss because its workforce, tax base, and way of life were structured around that industry. But when a local economy is diverse - it may include outdoor recreation, hospitality, small contractors, research and development, higher education, etc. - the shock can be absorbed because other employment opportunities, sources of tax revenue, and cultural identity exist. Similarly, a diverse economy can also be more resilient to natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, or wildfires. As the old saying goes, you shouldnt put all your eggs in one basket.</p><h3><strong>What makes an economy sustainable?</strong></h3><p>A sustainable economy serves current societys social and economic interests while protecting the natural environment. By striking this balance, future generations will have ample access to economic opportunities. They will not be robbed of health, well-being, and the stable planetary ecosystem necessary for society to function. Sustainability means stability. Stability is vital to sustainability because, without it, economic decisions narrow down to a short-term framework that can lead to reactionary policies and actions. We lose the vision and goals that keep us focused on not just the now but on the future. In other words, for sustainable economics and long-term thinking and planning to be successful, some level of economic stability must be achieved.</p><p><img class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/Green%2DEconomy.JPG"" /></p><p>Because a sustainable economy balances social and economic interests, it values quality of life, work, and health outcomes for communities. This valuation asks questions like ""Whose needs are being considered?"" and ""Whose needs are being ignored?""; and ""Which variables are considered ""costs"" in the decision-making process?"". In other words, sustainability aims to reduce the negative externalities (harms) while elevating and enhancing the positive externalities (benefits) created by decisions made.</p><p>Frequently, companies and businesses argue that regulations hurt their bottom line. Yet, it is rare for them to admit when policies and regulations allow them to ""externalize"" costs, or in other words, place their businesss physical and economic burdens onto the workforce and local communities rather than preventing or mitigating those harms in the first place. Such externalities include poor air quality, water pollution, or low wages. Here in Pennsylvania, a clear example of industry externalizing their costs is how oil and gas drillers abandon their wells when they are no longer ""productive"", <a href=""/News-Environmental-Groups-Sue-Pennsylvanias-General-Assembly-and-Governor-Josh-Shapiro-for-Not-Holding-Oil-Gas-Companies-Accountable-for-Abandoned-Wells"">leaving the taxpayers on the financial hook</a> to clean up their mess.</p><p>On the other hand, sustainable businesses would enhance quality of life by reducing pollution, improving air quality, and providing quality jobs that offer opportunities for professional growth and higher wages. Ideally, the cycle continues - <a href=""https://www.pawildscenter.org/programs-and-services/studies-reports/"">improving quality of life improves environmental health, attracting businesses and a competitive workforce</a>. Sustainability results in a positive feedback loop, in contrast to what fossil fuels offer, which includes environmental degradation, market volatility, and unstable employment.</p><h3><strong>How do we move Pennsylvania toward a sustainable economy?</strong></h3><p>To create a more sustainable economy in Pennsylvania, we must explore how we can generate economic activity, protect the environment, and enhance quality of life while using our natural resources more efficiently. This exploration will lead us to identify products, services, and processes that reduce or limit environmental harm. Of course, this new economys foundation requires clean energy, clean tech for production processes, and an energy-efficient industry.</p><p>This shift in strategy will be challenging in Pennsylvania because fossil fuels are entrenched in our economy and culture. But change is possible. Communities are beginning to <a href=""https://www.shalepalwv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-Re-Imagine-Beaver-County-Book.pdf"">re-envision a future</a> that is less reliant on dirty energy and more focused on quality of life. Momentum is building. Communities are eager for a path forward. Decision-makers and policy experts need to develop that path.</p><p>While the environmental movement relies heavily upon regulation, it alone will not transition us to a sustainable economy. We must also create and utilize economic policies that incentivize and establish preferences for clean energy, clean tech, energy efficiency, and sustainable businesses (e.g., ""green collar jobs"").</p><p>State policy is a great place to focus our efforts because increasing sustainability on a local and regional level is foundational to success. Building local capacity for sustainable business and industry increases support for local-serving economic activities (i.e., businesses that do not export their goods or services). This support is vital because:</p><ul><li>High quality of life attracts and retains businesses and workers,</li><li>Local services support industry clusters, local services - like education and health care - play critical roles in communities and are considered public goods,</li><li>And providing services locally is more efficient and cost-effective, as compared to importing them. (<a href=""https://communityinnovation.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/defining_the_green_economy_a_primer_on_green_economic_development.pdf?width=1200&height=800&iframe=true"">Defining the Green Economy</a>)</li></ul><p><img class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/Green%2DPolicies.JPG"" /></p><p>Thus, to move Pennsylvania towards a more sustainable economy, it will take the creation and utilization of standards, regulations, incentives, technical assistance, and marketing programs combined with supportive economic policies that can include options like local purchasing requirements, local hiring requirements, labor standards, and provisions that allow agencies to clawback funds when standards are not met.</p><p>As we outline in our latest report, ""<a href=""/Files/Admin/PF%5FDCED%5FReport%5F5.pdf"">Economic Policy IS Environmental Policy: Prioritizing Environmental Progress in Pennsylvanias Department of Community and Economic Development</a>"", there are concrete steps like these that our state decision-makers should take to move towards a more sustainable economy. It begins by reforming key state agencies, like the DCED so that the development and deployment of renewable energy and cleantech manufacturing are prioritized utilizing the financial tools already at our disposal. This agency, in particular, has the potential to leverage its private sector influence to effectively facilitate Pennsylvanias transition to a sustainable economy fueled by renewable energy. When reshaping our economy, the government has a great deal of influence. In Pennsylvania, that influence should be redirected towards renewables and cleantech to support a stable and sustainable economy for all.</p><h3><strong>What would a more sustainable future look like for Pennsylvania?</strong></h3><p>If we take a look at the long-term and systems thinking that creates sustainability and apply that to Pennsylvania, a sustainable economy should include:</p><ul><li>Cleantech manufacturing revitalizes economically distressed communities;</li><li>R&D, biotech, and life sciences industries expanding economic opportunities in rural regions;</li><li>Facilities fueled by renewable energy, which was developed and installed by local contractors;</li><li>Energy assessment and energy efficiency efforts reduce home heating and cooling costs;</li><li>State and local governments attracting and obtaining funding to support low-income residents efforts to weatherize their homes and</li><li>Stronger and more resilient supply chains that are regionally based and reduce energy and material waste.</li></ul><p>This vision can become a reality. Making it happen requires understanding the complex and nuanced systems that create the framework for our economy. It also demands that our decision-makers be visionaries willing to lead.</p><h3><strong>We cannot wait.</strong></h3><p>In the past, our inability to address the crises of our economic and environmental systems has led to an endless cycle of temporary ""recoveries"" in various industries and the greater economy, leaving workers and families to struggle in their wake. While we must recognize that economics is a critical decision-making factor when planning or responding to a crisis, it should not be the only factor. Historically, the economic argument has been to allow the market to dictate which solutions and mitigations of the crisis are viable and appropriate. Waiting for the market has <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/without-government-the-marketplace-will-not-solve-climate-change/"">wasted precious time</a> and distracted decision-makers, ultimately delaying progress. At the same time, the window of opportunity and the number of options to address the climate crisis narrows. We show deference to market imperatives at our planetary peril.</p><p>It is time that we re-envision our economy in a way that prioritizes economic stability and community health. We must reduce economic volatility and environmental pollution and create an alternative vision for our future. We should not rely on what harms us to provide our livelihoods, goods, and services. Sustainability offers another way, and PennFuture is committed to helping realize that future.</p>",Community; Energy,"Donna Kohut, Policy Manager for Sustainable Economics",,
How Recent US Supreme Court Decisions Harm Environmental Protection,8/2/2024,"<p>While PennFuture's recent <a href=""/News-PA-Supreme-Court-Grants-Intervention-to-Environmental-Organizations-in-RGGI-Litigation"">success</a> with the Environmental Rights Amendment from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is good news for public health and the environment, some very bad decisions being handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court show the fight is far from over. Our legal team <a href=""/Blog-Item-PA-and-a-Post-Chevron-World"">summarized</a> perhaps the biggest recent threat to environmental law in the nation with the Supreme Court's decision in the <em>Loper Bright</em> case which overturned decades of legal precedent that gave the scientists, doctors, and experts at federal administrative agencies deference in developing regulations that protect the health and safety of our communities and environment. But there are a few other Supreme Court decisions that we wanted to call your attention to that continue to dismantle the power of administrative agencies and open the door to new challenges of settled laws.</p><h3><strong>No real time limits to challenge federal regulations</strong></h3><p>First up, we have <em>Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Resrv. Sys.</em>, 603 U.S. ____ (2024). In this decision, the one-two punch just days after <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Supreme Court eradicated our ability to rely on seemingly settled federal regulations. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a party has six years to challenge a final agency action (e.g., rule, regulation, policy decision) that is issued by an administrative agency. This is known as the ""statute of limitations""; after that time runs, you cannot challenge the final agency action in court. But what the Supreme Court did in <em>Corner Post</em> is significantly shift the time when this statute of limitations begins to run. So, the six years no longer starts when an agency publishes a final rule or regulation (a known, set date), but instead starts when a would-be challenger is first harmed by a rule. This means that an interest that wants to challenge a rule, whether it was issued 1 year, 10 years, or 40 years ago, can create a new entity (corporation) for the sole purpose of being ""injured"" by that regulation, and boom-they can have their day in court.</p><p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson summarized the dire place in which we now find ourselves in her dissenting opinion:</p><p>""The tsunami of lawsuits against agencies that the Court's holdings [<em>Corner Post</em>] and <em>Loper Bright</em> have authorized has the potential to devastate the functioning of the Federal Government. Even more to the present point, that result simply cannot be what Congress intended when it enacted legislation that stood up and funded federal agencies and vested them with authority to set the ground rules for the individuals and entities that participate in our economy and our society. It is utterly inconceivable that [the APA's] statute of limitations was meant to permit fresh attacks on settled regulations from all newcomers forever. Yet, that is what the majority holds today.""</p><p>Thus, when taken together with the dissolving of agency deference in <em>Loper Bright</em>, no federal rule or regulation is sacred anymore. The regulations we rely on to reduce carbon emissions and toxic air pollutants, to ensure healthy indoor air quality, to keep harmful bacteria, PFAS, and other harmful pollution out of our drinking water-they could all be challenged by industry at any time, leaving our communities and future generations in peril. Let the chaos monkeys reign!</p><h3><strong>Administrative tribunal declared unconstitutional, limiting agency enforcement options</strong></h3><p>As if that isn't enough, <em>SEC v. Jarkesy</em>, 603 U.S. ____ (2024), makes it more difficult to hold those who violate rules accountable. Although this case is specifically about the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ultimate holding is likely to impact other federal administrative agencies, like the EPA, who have the authority to bring enforcement actions before in-house administrative tribunals instead of in federal court. We are all familiar with our court system, but what many may not realize is that there are also administrative tribunals that are overseen by administrative law judges (ALJs). (EPA, for example, has an Office of Administrative Law Judges.) ALJs conduct hearings and issue decisions in proceedings between an administrative agency and persons, businesses, government entities, and other organizations that are, or are alleged to be, regulated under the laws that the agency is tasked with promulgating and enforcing. The ALJs have unique expertise in their respective fields and are therefore very well situated to hear challenges to highly technical and complicated legal matters in areas such as environmental, financial, labor, and health and safety law. While decisions of ALJs are appealable to the courts, they provide the trial-level and first-level appellate reviews of these technical matters and agency decisions. In the <em>Jarkesy</em> case for example, the SEC brought a civil (as opposed to criminal) action against <em>Jarkesy</em> and his hedge fund alleging mismanagement of funds controlling $24 million. After an extensive evidentiary hearing, the SEC ALJs found Jarkesy liable for securities fraud and ordered him to pay $300,000 in penalties and sanctions for his actions.</p><p>Here, the Supreme Court agreed with an extreme opinion by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, that held ALJs and administrative tribunals are unconstitutional. In short, the Supreme Court held that these civil administrative tribunal actions violate the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a right to a trial by jury in most civil lawsuits, and that the ""public rights"" exception does not apply to punitive (e.g., enforcement) actions (the Supreme Court did not rule on the 5th Circuit's other two unconstitutional points: the non-delegation doctrine and separation of powers).</p><p>The likelihood of this decision being limited to the SEC's administrative tribunal is very small, meaning that every federal administrative agency tribunal court could similarly be declared unconstitutional. As Justice Sonya Sotomayor points out in her dissent, ""the Constitutionality of hundreds of statutes may now be in peril, and dozens of agencies could be stripped of their power to enforce laws enacted by Congress."" What's more, some administrative agencies, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, are only statutorily authorized to bring enforcement actions through these in-house tribunals. In those situations, it is unclear what will happen. But perhaps the real threat of the <em>Jarkesy</em> decision, especially to environmental law, is that it is extremely resource-intensive to bring litigation in federal courts and, therefore, many agencies may need to triage the enforcement actions they are able to bring. This will ultimately result in less enforcement against polluters and more unchecked harm to our communities and environment. </p><h3><strong>The stripping away of administrative agency authority</strong></h3><p>What is painfully clear from this trifecta of recent Supreme Court cases is that it will be harder for administrative agencies that are entrusted with the protection of our environment, our health, and our safety to do their jobs. There will be more litigation in the federal courts challenging strong regulations and this will take significant time and money and will distract resources away from the agencies' ability to hold bad actors accountable. It will also make the job of environmental advocates and attorneys, like PennFuture, harder-and yet more important. As we announced previously: At PennFuture, our legal team will continue to push for strong federal and state regulations to protect our air and water and to continue to beat back against the ravages of climate change. We will help defend agency regulations that work towards these goals, and we will help challenge agency regulations that are not protective enough.</p><p>This includes working harder to protect our strong Pennsylvania regulations and to push for more stringent state protections where we can.

"PA and a Post ""Chevron"" World",7/10/2024,"<p>On June 28, 2024, the United States Supreme Court issued a <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf"">decision</a> in <em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimando, 603 U.S. ___ (2024)</em>, overturning the long-standing precedent of <em>Chevron v. NRDC</em> from 1984. In response, <a href=""/News-PennFutures-Statement-on-SCOTUS-Overruling-Chevron-Doctrine"">PennFuture said</a> that ""Chevron has stood for the foundational idea that certain issues are technical, nuanced, and require high levels of expertise that are beyond the knowledge of an individual judge... the real-world impacts of this [Loper Bright] decision will be far-reaching and will result in harm to our communities, especially those most at risk, and our environment."" In this blog, PennFuture's legal team will explain the history and context of the <em>Chevron</em> decision, explain the <em>Loper Bright</em> decision, and look at what this major change in the law means for environmental and human health protections in Pennsylvania.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/512px%2DHerring%5Ffishing%2D%5Fday%5Fone.jpg"" /></p><h2>Background</h2><p>To understand the significance of the <em>Chevron</em> and <em>Loper Bright</em> decisions, let's start with some background about the relationship between Congress and federal agencies. Congress's primary responsibility is enacting federal laws called statutes. Many statutes-for instance, environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act-address complex issues. Congress identifies broad concerns and generally directs how they should be addressed. Still, it typically lacks the time and expertise to put into a statute every detail about how to address the problem. Moreover, it doesn't make sense for Congress to enshrine that level of detail in a statute when such details and the methods available to address those concerns or problems may change over time.</p><p>That's where the federal agencies and regulations come in. Rather than attempting to address every aspect of, say, air pollution or securities fraud in a statute, Congress delegates that responsibility to the federal agency responsible for administering that statute. For example, when the Clean Air Act (CAA) was passed, Congress decided that air pollution should be controlled and that one of the ways to do that would be to require persons who create sources of air pollution to obtain permits. However, Congress did not exhaustively list all possible pollutants or get into the details to determine precisely how much of each pollutant each permittee should be allowed to emit. Instead, Congress directed the EPA to create regulations to cover these specifics within the parameters set out by the statute. This approach not only places the development of specific standards in the hands of experts, the ""masters of the subject,"" but it also allows agencies' interpretations to shift over time (e.g., if a new pollutant is discovered or a new technology allows for greater pollution reduction) without requiring constant amendments to the statute.</p><p>While this approach makes sense, given the different roles and expertise levels of Congress and the various federal agencies, it can sometimes lead to disputes about whether an agency's interpretation faithfully executes what Congress contemplated when enacting the statute. In <em>Chevron</em>, the Supreme Court provided a way to answer that question.</p><h2>What was the Chevron decision, and how did it come about?</h2><p>In the early 1970s, a group of corporate-backed ""think tanks,"" including the Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers, and others, <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/684818?mag=why-reagan-became-the-great-deregulator&seq=8"">launched a campaign</a> to restructure our government. These groups had a significant influence on Ronald Reagan's policies, and when he became president in 1981, a seismic wave of deregulation began, reshaping the landscape of our government.</p><p>One small, seemingly insignificant footnote to this campaign was a rule change at the EPA, spearheaded by Reagan's appointee as EPA Administrator, Anne Gorsuch.</p><p>While permitting requirements in the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments required certain standards for ""sources"" that increased their emissions, the EPA under Gorsuch sought to limit the law's applicability. It decided that a new or modified source, like a boiler or a furnace, could increase emissions without triggering these requirements, provided the facility where it was installed didn't have a net increase in emissions. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) fought this decision all the way to the Supreme Court, and in 1984, the Gorsuch EPA won.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruled that if the language of an agencys enabling legislation (that is, the federal statute like the Clean Air Act in this case) is ambiguous, courts will defer to the agencys ""reasonable"" interpretation. Known to generations of law students as ""the <em>Chevron</em> two-step,"" it stood for the proposition that the professionals at administrative agencies, like the EPA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and many others are better situated than the courts to understand and implement the complex laws passed by our Congress.</p><p>The ""two-step"" framework works like this:</p><ul><li>In step 1, the court reviewing the challenge to the agency regulation decides if the statute is ambiguous, meaning the court evaluates if Congress clearly directed the agency to do a specific thing or if it left open something for the agency to decide. If the court finds that the statute is unambiguous, then the agency must do what the statute unambiguously directs. If the court finds that the statute is ambiguous, the Court moves to step 2.</li><li>In step 2, the court evaluates if the agency's interpretation of the statute is reasonable. If the court finds that the agency's interpretation is reasonable, then it defers to the agency. Even if the parties argue, for example, that the agency's interpretation is a bad idea or represents a bad policy, the court will uphold the agency's determination under the statute so long as it is a reasonable interpretation of the language Congress wrote. This is known as ""Chevron deference.""</li></ul><h2>Forty Years of Chevron</h2><p>While little notice was given when it was decided, <em>Chevron</em> would become a core foundation of administrative law, especially critical in environmental law, and one of the most-cited decisions ever. At first, the corporate interests that won in <em>Chevron</em> were happy to see the decision used to limit regulation. In 1985, a young attorney named Samuel Alito (yup, that Samuel Alito) even won a case on behalf of the Chemical Manufacturers Association that relied, in part, on <em>Chevron</em>. (Chemical Manufacturers Assoc. v. NRDC, 470 U.S. 116 (1985)). However, the embrace of <em>Chevron</em> by corporate interests didn't last once it became clear that the ""Chevron deference"" could support the creation of needed rules just as easily as it had shepherded the Reagan-era deregulation. Many of the same interests that supported the deregulation that gave us <em>Chevron</em> began a new campaign to overrule the decision. Even Neil Gorsuch-yup, son of the Reagan EPA's Anne Gorsuch, whose actions led to <em>Chevron</em>-railed against the powers it added to the ""already titanic administrative state."" (<em>Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch</em>, 834 F.3d 1142, 1155 (10th Cir. 2016) (Gorsuch, J., concurring)).</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/supreme%2Dcourt%2Dof%2Dthe%2Dunited%2Dstates%2Droberts%2Dcourt%2D2022%2Df051bd.jpg"" /></p><h2>From herrings to judicial power: what happened in Loper Bright?</h2><p>Alito and Gorsuch, after becoming Supreme Court Justices themselves, both joined with the other conservative justices in a 6-3 vote to overrule <em>Chevron</em> in <em>Loper Bright</em>. The case started as a seemingly minor dispute in which a herring fishing company did not want to pay the costs of required federal monitors assigned to their boats. But it became the backdrop for a larger dispute where the Supreme Court asserted its own authority, and that of the judicial branch, over that of the Executive branch's administrative agencies.</p><p>A quick summary of the facts of the case that got us here: <em>Loper Bright</em> involves regulations passed by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the federal agency responsible for conserving and maintaining the United States ocean resources, including fisheries. This authority comes from a statute called the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA). To accomplish the MSA's fishery conservation and management goals, NMFS requires certain fishing vessels to carry NMFS ""observers"" on board ""for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation and management of the fishery."" Certain of these vessels also must cover the costs of carrying the observers. Loper Bright Enterprises and other fishing companies challenged the regulation, saying it exceeded what Congress authorized the NMFS to do.</p><p>The Supreme Court took the case as the opportunity to revisit <em>Chevron </em>and what happens when Congress leaves ambiguity in a statute. The conservative majority decided that <em>Chevron</em> must be overruled because, it claimed, interpretation of statutes is solely the courts responsibility. In the majority's view, ""agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities,"" and statutory interpretation should not be ""fundamentally different just because an administrative interpretation is in play."" It claimed that <em>Chevron</em>'s ""justifying presumption""-that agencies with the subject matter expertise are suited to interpret ambiguous statutes that they administer-was ""a fiction."" Therefore, while courts may look to agencies' interpretations of statutes for aid and guidance, they are not to defer to those interpretations.</p><p>(As for the question of the fishing vessels, the Court sent the case back to the lower courts to decide whether the MSA authorized the NMFS to require vessels to carry and pay for observers without giving deference to the NMFS's interpretation.)</p><p>In her dissent, Justice Kagan paints a different picture when a choice must be made. ""Who should give content to a statute when Congress's instructions have run out?"" she wrote, ""Should it be a court? Or should it be the agency Congress has charged with administering the statute? The answer <em>Chevron</em> gives is that it should usually be the agency, within the bounds of reasonableness.""</p><p>Objecting to the majority's theory that agencies have no special competence in resolving ambiguities, Justice Kagan goes on to explain why they are the best suited to do so:</p><p>""Some interpretive issues arising in the regulatory context involve scientific or technical subject matter. Agencies have expertise in those areas; courts do not. Some demand a detailed understanding of complex and interdependent regulatory programs. Agencies know those programs inside-out; again, courts do not. And some present policy choices, including trade-offs between competing goods. Agencies report to a President, who in turn answers to the public for his policy calls; courts have no such accountability and no proper basis for making policy. And of course Congress has conferred on that expert, experienced, and politically accountable agency the authority to administer-to make rules about and otherwise implement-the statute giving rise to the ambiguity or gap.""</p><p>However, Chief Justice Roberts, in his opinion, establishes a new standard that, should a court find that the language Congress wrote reasonably allows for more than one course of action, the path chosen by an agency must not only be reasonable but also the course of action that the court would have chosen. Roberts claims that to do otherwise violates the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) requirement that the court ""decide all relevant questions of law."" But that justification is problematic. First, Chief Justice Roberts omitted the first part of that sentence, in which the APA says the courts should decide questions of law only ""to the extent necessary."" Secondly, if this approach were actually required by the APA, there would have been no need for the court to invent the ""major questions doctrine"" which Roberts himself used in <em>West Virginia v. EPA</em> in 2022. (Under the major questions doctrine, courts may find that Congress did not delegate the power to address major political or economic issues to executive agencies, even if the statutes plain language appears to do just that.) Debates over regulatory language aside, if the language Congress wrote reasonably allows for more than one course of action, which of the reasonable alternatives to pick is a policy question, not a ""question of law."" It's not surprising court watchers have referred to Robert's opinion in <em>Loper Bright</em> as <a href=""https://www.thenation.com/article/society/chevron-deference-supreme-court-power-grab/"">""the biggest judicial power grab since 1803.""</a></p><h2>Loper Bright and the Environment: What is in jeopardy?</h2><p>Since 1984, courts have applied the <em>Chevron</em> doctrine in thousands of cases. While the <em>Loper Bright</em> ruling doesn't automatically invalidate those prior decisions, it will likely spawn a wave of litigation that could conceivably affect all our administrative agencies, thus putting decades of environmental and health protections at risk. Even where agency action is ultimately upheld, the costs of such litigation could be substantial.</p><p>Rules related to environmental protection and our response to the climate crisis are particularly at risk in these challenges. In particular, there are two recent climate-related regulations that we've been tracking:</p><ul><li>In March of 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved new rules requiring companies to disclose material climate-related risks to investors.</li><li>In April of 2024, the EPA issued New Source Performance Standards for carbon pollution from power plants.</li></ul><p>Moreover, as we'll discuss in another blog, the Supreme Court also just blew wide open the ability of entities to challenge seemingly ""safe"", decades-old agency regulations under the APA. Coupled with <em>Loper Bright</em>, we must now be prepared for an onslaught of challenges to regulations that our communities have long relied upon for clean air and safe water.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/49525429808%5Faabef569a6%5Fc.jpg"" /></p><h2>What does it mean for Pennsylvania...</h2><p>While the decision in <em>Loper Bright</em> is likely to significantly harm EPA's ability to protect public health and the environment at the federal level, its effect on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is less direct.</p><p>Certainly, losing the backstop of strong federal regulations will create challenges for the DEP. The politics of enacting new regulations is much easier when the DEP implements a federal rule than when it acts on its own initiative. There are even restrictions in PA laws that prohibit the DEP, in certain specific cases, from enacting regulations more stringent than the minimum federal requirements without specific justification. Thus, should challenges under this new standard erode federal protections, DEP's hands may be tied to maintain the status quo.</p><p>There are also cases, such as establishing motor vehicle emissions standards, where federal law prohibits PA from creating standards. In that case, we can choose between the federal and more protective California standards. In many cases, we follow the California standard, but those rules could face new challenges in states that may adopt the new Loper Bright standard of review for state agency actions.</p><p>There is a glimmer of good news regarding the deference our state courts give to DEP. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recognized the principle of agency deference well before <em>Chevron</em> was decided in 1984. Since then, the Court has <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2394456/seeton-v-pennsylvania-game-comn/"">repeatedly cited <em>Chevron</em></a> to explain its decisions. The fact that the U.S. Supreme Court has changed its mind doesn't necessarily mean our Supreme Court will agree. But we must remain vigilant.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Agencies will continue to enact regulations. And those regulations will continue to be subject to challenges both from those who believe them to be too burdensome and from those who believe them to be too weak. After <em>Loper Bright</em>, the question of whether those regulations will withstand challenge is now exclusively in the hands of whatever judge ends up hearing the challenge (which will certainly result in more ""forum shopping"" to get the ""right"" judge). We expect to see greater participation from experts and advocacy organizations in these challenges, as those on both sides attempt to persuade the judge of the correctness of their arguments. At PennFuture, our legal team will continue to push for strong federal and state regulations to protect our air and water and to continue to beat back against the ravages of climate change. We will help defend agency regulations that work towards these goals, and we will help challenge agency regulations that are not protective enough. We believe this power grab-taking away power from agencies and instead relocating it in the federal judiciary-is undemocratic and harmful. And you can count on us being there, even when things are stacked against us, to still fight for regulations that protect our health and our environment.</p>",Environment,"Abigail M.

On June 24, 2024, the PA House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee held a hearing on HB 2277 (Otten) to consider the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard, better known as ""PRESS""-an overhaul of the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) Act. PRESS envisions a future where 35% of our energy is derived from Tier I sources by 2035. This ambitious goal necessitates a significant expansion of our solar generation, a vision we glimpsed in the <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/SolarFuture/Pages/Finding-Pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-Solar-Future.aspx"">""Finding Pennsylvania's Solar Future""</a> project in 2018, along with parallel growth in wind and other clean sources.</p><h3><img class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/download.jpg"" /><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h3><p>In 2004, Pennsylvania passed the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) Act to diversify its energy sources. The goal was to promote a cleaner environment and protect PA households from increasing energy costs. It accomplished this by establishing what is known as ""portfolio standards"" or targets, requiring energy companies to ensure that a certain percentage of the energy they sell in Pennsylvania comes from clean sources such as solar and wind, among others. Pennsylvania was among the first states to adopt a portfolio standard. Still, the goals set for clean energy turned out to be too modest-clean ""Tier I"" energy sources were to provide a mere 8% of our energy needs.</p><p>Consequently, other states surpassed us in attracting new clean energy development and the associated job opportunities.</p><h3><strong>Expanding solar generation is the right move for Pennsylvania.</strong></h3><p>If we hope to avoid the worst impacts of the growing climate crisis, we need to maximize our clean, renewable generation as quickly as possible. Cutting carbon pollution is vital, but more clean energy means fewer toxic air pollutants, heavy metals, harmful particulates, and smog-producing chemicals will be dumped in our atmosphere.</p><ul><li>Can I live near a solar farm and not develop asthma? <strong>Yes</strong>, there is no scientific evidence that living near a solar farm poses any health risks.</li><li>Can I raise children near a solar farm without them developing cancer? <strong>Yes</strong>, there is no scientific evidence that living near a solar farm poses any health risks.</li></ul><p><strong>The same cannot be said for living next to a fracking pad.</strong></p><p>Solar energy also makes economic sense. Sharon Pillar, Executive Director of the PA Solar Center, testified about recent modeling showing a bill like this bringing over $13 billion in new investment over the next few years and creating over 100,000 jobs. Robert Routh, attorney and Policy Director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, spoke about the Council's analysis, showing PRESS could create over 15,000 new jobs each year from 2025 through 2040 while increasing the energy we export to other states.</p><h3><img class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/6206184246%5Fce3ec3d39e%5Fw.jpg"" /><strong>We need PRESS now more than ever.</strong></h3><p>When AEPS was first considered, coal generation was responsible for 57 percent of Pennsylvanias electricity, and methane gas (in the days before fracking) provided less than 1 percent. Today, fracked gas provides more than 58 percent of our electricity, and coal is at 6 percent and falling.</p><p>While the fracking industry is quick to point out that coal's failure to compete in the market with fracked gas resulted in lower emissions, they want us to ignore that the gas boom has left us in a dangerous and unsustainable situation.</p><p>After the pandemic in 2022, fracked gas set bad records for its price volatility. Worse yet, retail prices in the region were almost 50 percent higher than at the start of the fracking boom. Not surprisingly, consumers' electric prices also spiked with the increasing dependence on fracked gas for generation.</p><p>While boom-and-bust volatility is common in the fossil fuel industry, the poor gas reliability problem exacerbated the situation. During Winter Storm Elliot, which struck Pennsylvania over Christmas 2023, more than 70 percent of the unplanned outages on the PJM power grid were caused by gas plants being unable to run when needed. That drove wholesale electric prices in some places on our grid over $3,700 per megawatt hour, more than 200 times our typical wholesale prices.</p><p>It would be ridiculous to imagine a financial advisor who, upon finding their client had 58% of their life savings in a highly volatile and risky stock, would recommend that the best course of action would be to double down and put even more eggs in that basket.</p><p>If you want to mitigate volatility and risk, the obvious answer is to diversify your investments. If someone were to suggest otherwise, you might suspect they are putting their own interests ahead of yours and (rightly) take everything they say with a large grain of salt. Hearing the fracking industry say Pennsylvania needs more gas is a giant red flag and should raise those same concerns.</p><h3><strong>The fracking industry has reason to worry.</strong></h3><p>Having seen the coal industry go from dominating the energy generation sector to a footnote in just a few years, the fracking industry is rightly scared of the same happening to them. The writing may be on the wall already-clean, renewable generation is often less expensive and is getting cheaper. When we look at ""active"" projects in our power grid's interconnection process, Pennsylvania has over 9,400 megawatts of solar and only 35 megawatts of gas in the pipeline. As much as the industry wants to blame environmentalists and regulators for its woes, it seems to have increasing difficulty convincing Wall Street that it is a good bet.</p><p>If there was any doubt that the industry is worried, the performance of one of the pro-fracking speakers from the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association (PMA) at the hearing was telling. I can't say he included every misleading half-truth, scare tactic, or borderline conspiracy theory that anyone ever applied to solar energy. Still, if he left any out, it wasn't for lack of trying.</p><p>The telling exchange, though, came after his talk.</p><p>Representative Otten, the prime sponsor of the PRESS bill, spoke up: ""I am always entertained by your hyperbole..."" (she began before noting the speaker was, ostensibly, at the hearing representing Pennsylvania's manufacturing interests). </p><p>Rep. Otten: ""So is that the position of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association that youre not interested in and taking advantage of the federal programs [Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act] that are designed to grow the economy and bring jobs to Pennsylvania?""</p><p>Rather than answer ""no,"" the speaker took the opportunity to lecture the Representative on the virtues of private investment and expressed concern that competition in the market might cause the gas industry to ""lose organic economic growth.""</p><p>Rep. Causer added an accusation that investments such as these were a case of the government ""picking winners and losers."" </p><p>While the speaker from PMA referred to federal clean energy investments as ""market manipulations,"" neither he nor Rep. Causer mentioned how heavily subsidized the fossil fuel industry has been at the state and federal levels for decades. Also, when Rep. Armanini-who earlier criticized clean energy-complained that a company in his district didn't qualify for a particular government program, he didn't get the same lecture on the virtue of private investment; there was no suggestion that the program was a ""market manipulation;"" there was just a mournful look from the speaker who said, ""that is very sad.""</p><p>Its important to ask: Why is it that the polluting industry never seems to be held to the same standards as clean energy?</p><p><em>PennFuture is ramping up our efforts to connect economic development to environmental issues to promote a healthy economy, healthy communities, and a healthy environment.

The Unspoken Truth: Economic Policy is Environmental Policy,6/28/2024,"<p><span>(<strong>Title image:</strong> Shell Cracker Plant by Mark Dixon)</span></p><p>Economic development projects shape the landscape and impact everyday life by influencing air quality, traffic volume, stormwater flow, and local employment opportunities.</p><p>Economic development can bring massive benefits to our communities, but it also brings other consequences that must be considered. These social and environmental considerations are known as ""externalities."" The most common and visible examples in Pennsylvania include abandoned mine drainage leaching pollution into local waterways, job loss due to the closure of coal-fired power plants, and toxic emissions that degrade air quality and hasten climate change. These externalities often have a disproportionate impact on historically underinvested, low-resource communities and communities of color, and their effects can last for generations.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/DCED%2D%281%29.jpg"" /><br /> While industry refuses to calculate the health care costs of toxic emissions or place a monetary value on clean water and open space, we know that it is necessary. We live in a culture that looks to the market for solutions to all kinds of problems. If we do not calculate the value or cost of something, the market cannot offer a solution, and government policy cannot appropriately fund programs that address, mitigate, or disincentivize harm.</p><p>PennFuture's new report, <a href=""/Files/Admin/PF%5FDCED%5FReport%5F5.pdf"">Economic Policy <em>is</em>Environmental Policy</a>,engages with these issues, initiating a dialogue about the confluence of economic development and environmental impacts. This report offers information for Pennsylvania policy leaders during rapid technological and environmental change. It also rebuts the false narrative that a healthy environment precludes a robust economy and that continued dependence on fossil fuels will give rise to a stable and prosperous future for Pennsylvanians.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/ShellCracker.jpg"" /></p><p>The combination of fossil fuel-centered economic policies and weak environmental regulations has resulted in an economy that depends on dirty, finite energy resources, making it vulnerable to economic volatility. Most recently, Pennsylvanias economic development policies led to the construction of a new ethane cracker plant. However, the plant <a href=""https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pennsylvanias-Bad-Bet-FINAL.pdf"">fails to deliver</a> on the number of jobs promised and <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/environment-energy/2024-04-22/attorney-general-shell-whistleblower-pipeline-spills?utm_source=WESA&utm_campaign=087ba0c34e-inboxedition_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-5e22383ecb-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D"">consistently violates its permits</a>, releasing toxic pollutants into the air. If Pennsylvania continues to rely on the fossil fuel industries that dominated the last two centuries, our workers and our communities will be left behind. We will continue to leave behind a legacy of degraded air, water, and land.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Montour%2DPower%2DPlant.jpg"" /></p><p>This is because market forces are shifting, causing fossil fuels like coal and fracked gas to be in decline; and yet new opportunities abound. Fellow industrial states, like Ohio, West Virginia, and even Texas and Wyoming, are pivoting their economies in a different direction - toward renewable energy and <a href=""https://www.wsaz.com/2023/06/20/battery-manufacturing-plant-coming-ohio/"">cleantech manufacturing</a>. They are proactively investing in high-growth industries to strengthen and stabilize their economies against the volatility and decline of fossil fuels. While these states are not driven by the goal of environmental protection, these economic policy choices will result in better environmental outcomes.</p><p>The writing is on the wall: Forward-thinking economic development policy can transform Pennsylvania back into a leader in both the manufacturing and energy sectors. Decision-makers need to capitalize on high-growth industries that both decarbonize and diversify the economy, like battery manufacturing, energy efficiency, and the deployment of renewables. In the face of national economic and technological changes, stabilizing and modernizing Pennsylvanias economy must be paramount -for the sake of our workers and the climate.<br /> The Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) plays a crucial role in shaping Pennsylvanias economy. Our report delves into the organizations structure, administration, and importance, highlighting its key role in driving economic development policy for the state. Despite being unfamiliar to many, the DCED is pivotal in setting and facilitating the agenda for the states long-term economic development. As we move towards a decarbonized economy, it is essential for the DCED to proactively engage with the current landscape, ensuring that all communities, especially vulnerable ones, are included in this necessary economic transition.</p><p>As we point out in the report, there are concrete steps that can be taken to move the needle on this economic and environmental project. First, to take advantage of its strengths, the DCED must be reformed and its resources redirected toward industries that support the future of our workforce, communities, and public health, with an eye towards our environment and the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians. Establishing Climate Accountability Measures within its funding structure for program priorities and reshaping Pennsylvanias Energy Economy program would provide the necessary structure to prioritize clean energy investments and decarbonization efforts.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Bradford.jpg"" /><img src=""/Files/Admin/Susquehanna.jpg"" /></p><p>Second, the DCED must leverage its private sector influence through its strategic collaborations with public and private partnerships to facilitate Pennsylvanias transition to a modern and equitable economy, via an aggressive sector-based climate strategy. Pushing to reform Team PA (a private, 501(c)(3) organization tasked with <a href=""https://teampa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Team-PA-Executive-Order-2023.pdf"">""increasing job growth, retention, and creation""</a>) as a champion for Pennsylvanias transition to a decarbonized and diversified economy is the first step, beginning with the intentional inclusion of environmental groups on its private sector board of directors. Subsequently, to bolster Team PAs new mission, the state must create an interagency Clean Energy Working Group, which would develop a comprehensive plan that supports environmental justice and energy communities through the strategic deployment of decarbonization, energy efficiency, and renewable energy resources and infrastructure in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These changes will set Pennsylvania on a path toward establishing a stable economy that can sustain workers, communities, and the environment.</p><p>Declining fossil fuel markets and the impacts of the severe weather generated by our changing climate are driving decarbonization efforts across the country, and we are now seeing the creation of the necessary economic tools to fund them. Continued dependence on fossil fuels is an outdated economic game plan that will destabilize Pennsylvanias economy and perpetuate environmental and community degradation and injustice. A forward-thinking economic policy that prioritizes the decarbonization and renewable energy sectors can provide long-term certainty for industry and labor in a political climate that breeds instability through battles over environmental policy. We know how to get there and DCED is the key.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/DCED%2DReport%2D2024.jpg"" /></p><p>Read the full <strong><em>Economic Policy is Environmental Policy</em></strong> report <a href=""/Files/Admin/PF%5FDCED%5FReport%5F5.pdf"">here</a>.</p><p>Over the next few months, well bring you new information on our sustainable economic development work.

Summer 2024 Legal Interns,6/6/2024,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania's environment and ""create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.""</p><p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.<br /> But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognize that we need to be more involved with cultivating the people that will continue to support our mission. Our staff have a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.<br /> With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment.</p><p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting Pennsylvania as well as to further their potential environmental careers. We've seen success on this front as many of our legal interns have found work in the Pennsylvania environmental legal space. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.<br /> Over the past four years, our interns have made it possible for PennFuture's legal team to do more, faster, and better! They have supported our litigation efforts against water polluters and fracked-gas facilities, they have drafted comments in support of stronger regulatory protections across the Commonwealth, and they have helped our attorneys strategize and execute impactful legal actions. We are grateful for all of the hard work, passion, and dedication of our legal interns.<br /> This summer, we have three fantastic students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We've asked our new interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture's mission means to them:</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Headshot.jpg"" /></p><p><strong>Andriana Vega, rising Third Year student at Penn State Dickinson Law</strong><br /> Growing up in the Midwest around factory farming piqued my interest in environmental law. While farming is crucial to sustaining our population, the effects factory farming has on communities and the environment are devastating. The work done at PennFuture is precisely the reason I chose to become an attorney: to help move towards more sustainable practices in all industries, not just farming.<br /> I am most excited about learning from the experienced individuals at PennFuture and being able to contribute to projects that actually make a difference in the fight to preserve the environment. Climate change may not happen overnight, but it's the little victories that will tilt the needle.<br /> While at Penn State Dickinson Law I have remained actively involved in the community, serving as President of the school's Animal Legal Defense Fund; Vice President of Environmental Law Society; Co-founder, Treasurer and Vice President of the school's multicultural dance organization, The Moving Party; Treasurer of Hearsay Acapella Group; Chair of the Wellness Committee; and member of Phi Alpha Delta and the Latin Law Students Association.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/headshot%2DNYILR.png"" /></p><p><strong>Jessie Staley, rising Third Year student at St. John's University School of Law</strong><br /> Environmentalism has been a passion in my personal life for many years, but I had not considered it as a future career until I started law school. As a rising third year law student at St. Johns Law in New York, I am looking forward to a career in international environmental law.<br /> I completed my BA in Political Science and International Studies, with a focus in Peace Studies, at the University of Missouri. There, I gained an interest in civil armed conflicts and found that many start and persist due to environmental stressors, such as oil and/or food insecurity. I came to law school with the hopes of learning more about International Humanitarian Law and the legal frameworks for the intergovernmental organizations who lead international peace work, like the United Nations. While taking my first year courses, like Property Law, I found more intersections between the environment and conflict. I discovered my niche career path in International Water Law, addressing water scarcity as a strategy for peace work.<br /> I am very excited to work with PennFuture this summer to learn more about the nonprofit space and localized legal advocacy. With their Clean Water initiative, I have many opportunities to learn more about water law and various strategies to advocate for water access and quality. I hope to continue learning about environmental law and to learn new ways to be a better environmental lawyer from PennFuture's holistic advocacy approach.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/20200905%5F184832.jpg"" /></p><p><strong>Jasmine Gunning, rising Third Year student at Penn State Law</strong><br /> I am currently a J.D. candidate at Penn State Law (25) at University Park, PA. At Penn State Law, I have the pleasure of serving as Fellowship Chair for the Criminal Law Society, Outreach Coordinator for the Human Rights Society, and Secretary for the Immigration Law Society. Coming into law school, I wasn't quite sure what kind of law I wanted to practice, but I knew I wanted two things: to feel as if I'm making a difference, and to help others in some way. Environmental law checks both of those boxes for me.<br /> Growing up in rural South Carolina, I've always had great respect for our environment and all of the things it provides us with - food, water, recreation, and the space to just be. Over the years I've watched my home state develop and grow tremendously. This extreme growth has taught me a lot about the importance of both sustainability and conservation, as well as the interplay between the two, especially in marginalized communities. Wanting to ensure that those two concepts stay at the forefront of development and progress is what led me to environmental law, and more particularly, energy law.<br /> Over the past semester, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant in the shale division of the Penn State Law Center for Agriculture and Shale Law. That experience gave me the opportunity to study the specifics of the oil and gas industry, as well as how policymaking affects the industry, and vice versa. I am excited to apply this knowledge to my time here at PennFuture this summer, while also learning more about other areas of environmental law and policy. PennFuture's commitment to environmental advocacy is what drew me to this organization and I'm so honored to be part of the team!</p>",Environment,"Abigail M.

Despite plenty of debate over the ideal tools and policies, the budget process provides <a href=""/News-PennFuture-Applauds-Historic-Environmental-Investments-Included-in-New-State-Budget"">space for bipartisan cooperation</a> to achieve the goals of protecting and restoring Pennsylvania's abundant waterways.</p><p>On May 7, 2024, watershed coalition partners from across the Commonwealth met with 24 lawmakers in the Capitol for the 8th annual Clean Water Education Day. The <a href=""https://www.choosecleanwater.org/"">Choose Clean Water Coalition</a>, <a href=""https://www.delriverwatershed.org/"">Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed</a>, and members of the <a href=""https://www.healthylakes.org/"">Healing Our Water-Great Lakes Coalition</a> outlined their top five clean water priorities:</p><h2><strong>Funding & Policy Priorities</strong></h2><p>The coalitions called on the General Assembly and Governor Shapiro to support two new funding and legislative priorities:</p><ol><li><strong>Create the Healthy Outdoors for All Program (HOAP)</strong>, which would provide matching grants to fund projects that rehabilitate and support trails, parks, and open spaces. Clean water quality isnt just crucial for safeguarding public health and preserving ecosystems; it also enriches the recreational pursuits of those who cherish parks, trails, and the great outdoors. Supporting the establishment of the Healthy Outdoors for All Program will help revitalize and enhance parks, trails, and outdoor spaces, particularly expanding access for disadvantaged communities.</li><li><strong>Support the Riparian Buffer Protection Act (House Bill 1275)</strong> which mandates a 100-foot riparian buffer along each side of a surface body of water and a 300-foot buffer around special protection (High Quality or Exception Value) waters. Riparian buffers play a crucial role in curbing pollution runoff, combating climate change impacts, safeguarding ecosystems, and serving as a cost-efficient method for managing water quality. The Riparian Buffer Protection Act stands as a vital initiative through which the Commonwealth can actively encourage the establishment of more of these invaluable natural assets.</li></ol><p>Our watershed partners remained committed to pushing for progress on three priorities carrying over from last year's effort. We called on decision-makers to:</p><ol><li><strong>Support full ""fair share"" funding for the Interstate Basin Commissions</strong> responsible for protecting and monitoring water quality and quantity.Inadequately funded and staffed commissions put Pennsylvania's communities at risk of suffering from increased water pollution, infrastructure issues, and declining aquatic wildlife. Funding requirements for the interstate basin commissions have been established for decades, and Pennsylvania must honor the commitment made to these compacts.</li><li>Protect marginalized communities who bear the brunt of downstream pollution by <strong>codifying the Office of Environmental Justice (Senate Bill 158/House Bill 742) and the Environmental Justice Advisory Board (House Bill 707)</strong>. Clean water issues are also often environmental justice issues. We strongly advocate for strengthening the roles of the Office of Environmental Justice and the Environmental Justice Advisory Board to address the disproportionate burden borne by marginalized communities.</li><li><strong>Support sustainable annual funding for the Clean Streams Fund</strong>, the first Pennsylvania fund dedicated to water protection and restoration, created with American Rescue Plan Act funding in the 2022-23 budget. The CSF addresses the three primary causes of water pollution in PA: acid mine drainage, agriculture, and stormwater runoff. The scale of water pollution in Pennsylvania means that a one-time injection of funds into the Clean Streams Fund will not be sufficient.</li></ol><p>More detailed information about each of our 2024 requests <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zHRj9NUUfX7ptP120Leh9Xy2aw4mEbQC?usp=sharing"">can be found here</a>.</p><h2><strong>Tools for Engagement with Legislators & Fellow Advocates</strong><br /></h2><p>Meeting with lawmakers is a critical component of Clean Water Education Day, but the coalitions also recognize not all members and supporters can participate in-person in Harrisburg.

PennFuture has long held the role of Pennsylvania State Lead for both of these coalitions, which has allowed for the establishment of deep relationships with both the Coalition staff and their member organizations, both of which are vital to the success of this event. During the annual Clean Water Education event, Coalition staff leverage their resources to support the State Leads, producing talking points for joint priorities, communications materials, training, and social media content.</p><p><br /> PennFuture is now also serving as the state lead for the <strong>Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition</strong> and participating in <a href=""https://www.nwf.org/ohioriver"">collaborative advocacy in the Ohio River Valley Watershed</a> led by the National Wildlife Federation, the Ohio River Basin Alliance, and the Ohio River Valley Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO). We continue working to close the gap between Western PA and Harrisburg and are seeking out ways to engage with our Western PA partners.</p><p><br /><strong>Clean Water Education Day builds on the federal clean water advocacy of PennFuture staff as coalition state leads</strong>. Elected officials at all levels have roles in enhancing climate resilience, environmental justice, pollution prevention, and watershed-scale governance. PennFuture is ideally positioned to connect the dots between levels of government.</p><p>As state leads, PennFuture staff annually coordinate meetings for federal lobby days on behalf of the coalitions. The top priority for watershed Hill Days remains additional restoration funding - the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program, the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program, and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in the case of each coalition.

New Air Quality Report Shows More Work To Be Done For Pennsylvania's Air,5/2/2024,"<p>A new report shows Pennsylvania communities continue to struggle with poor air quality.Numerous Pennsylvania counties received failing grades for ozone and particle pollution, and the Pittsburgh metropolitan area remains the worst city for short-term and annual particle pollution in the region despite incremental improvements.</p><p>On April 24, 2024, the American Lung Association (ALA) released its 25th annual <a href=""https://www.lung.org/research/sota"">State of the Airreport</a>.In this report, the ALA used air quality data obtained from the U.S Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality System for two of the most widespread types of air pollution, ozone and particle pollution (also known as smog and soot).ALA analyzes this data to grade counties and rank cities based on ozone, year-round particle pollution, and short-term particle pollution levels.The 2024 report used data over the three-year period from 2020 to 2022.ALA's annual report allows the public to easily track air quality changes over time and to compare community exposures to air pollution.</p><h3><strong>Many Pennsylvania Counties Receive Failing or Poor Grades for High Ozone Days or Particle Pollution</strong></h3><p>The report shows that many <a href=""https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/states/pennsylvania"">Pennsylvania residents are exposed to harmful levels of air pollution</a>.Based on the air quality data available, the report assigned grades for 36 out of the 67 counties in Pennsylvania for at least one measure of air quality.Bucks and Philadelphia counties both received a failing grade for the number of high ozone days, with Allegheny County receiving a D grade and six other Pennsylvania counties receiving a C grade for high ozone days (Armstrong, Berks, Indiana, Mercer, Montgomery, and Northampton).</p><p>For short-term particle pollution, Allegheny and Lancaster counties each received a failing grade.Dauphin County received a D grade for short-term particle pollution and nine other Pennsylvania counties received a C grade (Beaver, Berks, Chester, Cumberland, Delaware, Lebanon, Northampton, Philadelphia, and York).</p><p>The grades and rankings for annual particle pollution in the 2024 report were calculated using the new, long-awaited National Ambient Air Quality Standards for fine particle pollution implemented by the EPA earlier this year.The EPA establishes these standards to be protective of public health, including sensitive populations, with an adequate margin of safety using the latest science and health data.The updated annual standard for fine particle pollution is now 9 micrograms per cubic meter, down from the previous standard of 12.</p><p>As a result of the report's use of the updated standard for annual particle pollution, more places around the country earned a failing grade in this year's report compared to the previous year, including counties in Pennsylvania.Seven Pennsylvania counties, Allegheny, Cambria, Dauphin, Delaware, Lancaster, Philadelphia, and York, all received failed grades for annual particle pollution.Overall, 18 counties in Pennsylvania received a C grade or lower for at least one pollutant measure.</p><h3><strong>Pittsburgh Metro Area Remains Worst in Region for Particle Pollution</strong></h3><p>This year's report once again showed that the cities with the highest levels of short-term particle pollution were those cities in the western U.S.The report identifies wildfires in the western U.S. and Canada as the major contributing factor to the increasing number of days and places with unhealthy levels of particle pollution in recent years.As a result, the 25 cities most polluted by daily particle pollution are all located west of the Mississippi River.</p><p>For the first time, the 12-county Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metropolitan area was edged out of the report's list of the 25 worst cities for daily particle pollution, coming in 26th in this year's report.The Pittsburgh metropolitan area remained in the top 25 list for worst polluted cities for annual particle pollution, ranking 19th in this year's report.However, despite incremental improvement in particle pollution levels, the Pittsburgh metropolitan area retains the dubious distinction of being the worst in the Mid-Atlantic region for annual particle pollution and the worst in the country east of Fargo, North Dakota for daily particle pollution levels.</p><p>Allegheny County received failing grades for both daily and annual particle pollution under the new EPA standard, despite incremental improvements in particle pollution levels. Allegheny County saw a slight increase in the annual weighted average of unhealthy air days for ozone smog, earning it a D grade, down from the C grade it received in last year's report.</p><p>The Pittsburgh area's continued status as the worst in the region for particle pollution and its high ranking nationwide, even without the acute impacts of wildfires experienced by the higher-ranked cities in the West, demonstrates the impact of local pollution sources on our region's air quality and the need for holding local industrial polluters accountable for particle pollution.</p><p>Overall, the 2024 ""State of the Air"" reports shows that many Pennsylvania residents are still experiencing the harmful effects of air pollution in their daily lives, and that much more needs to be done to ensure communities across the state can breathe clean air.</p><p>PennFuture is dedicated to protecting and improving air quality for all of Pennsylvania.If you are interested in supporting our work, <a href=""/donate"">please become a member today</a>!</p>",Environment,"Angela Kilbert, Staff Attorney",,
"Public Participation, Public Power: PennFuture's Community Land Use Process Guidebook",4/22/2024,"<h3><strong>Is This You?</strong></h3><p>Picture this: You have just learned of a significant land development proposal in your municipality. Maybe it's a massive distribution center, a sprawling resort, or a new shopping center. Or, maybe you heard rumors that your neighbor plans to convert their property into an Airbnb or a wedding venue. Maybe you learned of these things only after construction started and wish you'd known sooner. Or, maybe you want to be proactive and ensure that future land use and development in your area is rational and serves the needs of the community. Maybe you just want to better understand who decides what gets built where and how those decisions are made.</p><p>If this is you, PennFuture's latest resource-<a href=""/Publication-Land-Use-Is-an-Environmental-Issue-PennFuture-Publishes-A-New-Guide-to-Help-Pennsylvania-Residents-Understand-and-Effectively-Participate-in-Land-Use-Decision-Making""><em>Public Participation, Public Power: A Community Guide to Local Land Use Decision-Making in Pennsylvania</em></a>-is for you! This guide is designed to give Pennsylvanian residents the knowledge and tools they need to understand and effectively participate in local land use decision-making processes.</p><p>We get it-local government can seem opaque and perplexing. With a variety of government bodies making numerous types of land use decisions in multiple types of proceedings (not to mention arcane public notice requirements!), it's no wonder that the public often feels left in the dark and without a voice. PennFuture aims to change that, because we believe that robust, informed public participation in local land use decision-making is vital to protecting our environment and our communities.</p><h3><strong>Land Use is an Environmental Issue</strong></h3><p>Most of us intuitively understand how land use and development impact the character of our communities and our quality of life. What may seem less obvious is just how much appropriate management of land use and development is vital to protecting the natural environment. Where and to what extent land development occurs dictates the amount of impervious surface on the land, which in turn impacts water quality in nearby ground and surface waters and the amount of habitat available to wild plant and animal species. Sprawling land development patterns force longer, more frequent vehicle trips, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants, as well as the amount of impervious road surface required to connect destinations. Even agricultural uses (not commonly thought of as ""development"") can result in loss of native habitats, increase wind erosion, limit the amount of water available for other uses, and degrade water quality by introducing pesticides, fertilizers, and nutrients from animal manure into water sources.</p><p>Intelligent and informed regulation of land use and development is key to controlling environmental impacts, and intelligent and informed public participation in local land use decision-making is key to appropriate regulation.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, the power to govern land use and development resides almost entirely at the local level. Local governments have substantial power to control where land development can occur, the amount of impervious surface that may be constructed on any given parcel, the physical dimensions of structures, their relationship to neighboring properties and environmental features, and the level of public review required for each use. And local residents have substantial power to influence these decisions, if they know how. That's where PennFuture can help.</p><h3><strong>What the Guidebook Offers</strong></h3><p><em>Public Participation, Public Power</em> is a comprehensive guide to the various local bodies engaged in land use and development decision-making, the types of decisions that are made, and the processes and legal requirements governing those decisions. It includes:</p><ul><li>Explanation of the state and local laws that control land use decision-making and why that decision-making is based in those laws, not public opinion;</li><li>Advice on how to find and read local land use ordinances;</li><li>Descriptions of the various types of land use decisions that local governments make, the different local bodies that make them, and the processes and legal standards governing them;</li><li>Guidance on where and how to find information about upcoming land use decisions;</li><li>Information about your right to participate in local decision-making and tips on how to make effective and persuasive public comments;</li><li>Tips on participating as a party in local hearings, including advice on presenting evidence, cross-examining witnesses, and arguing your position;</li><li>Advice on how to advocate for changes to existing land use ordinances;</li><li>Information about the Right to Know Law and how to use it to obtain written records from local agencies;</li><li>Quick-reference Fact Sheets for understanding and participating in each type of local land use decision; and</li><li>A glossary of land use terms.</li></ul><p>This new community guidebook will be available for download and in print on April 23-Earth Day!</p><p>PennFuture is excited to provide this resource to help individuals, groups, and organizations across the Commonwealth effectively participate in local land use decision-making. <a href=""/Publication-Land-Use-Is-an-Environmental-Issue-PennFuture-Publishes-A-New-Guide-to-Help-Pennsylvania-Residents-Understand-and-Effectively-Participate-in-Land-Use-Decision-Making"">Take a look</a> and find out how YOU can enhance your power to make a difference for your community and the environment!</p><p><strong>Additional Land Use Resources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""/Blog-Item-Updated-Zoning-Ordinances-Are-Vital-to-Addressing-the-Impacts-of-Todays-Logistics-Industry"">Updated Zoning Ordinances Are Vital to Addressing the Impacts of Today's Logistics Industry</a></li><li><a href=""/Blog-Item-Logistics-Facilities-are-Coming-Is-Your-Municipality-Ready-PennFuture-Releases-Model-Logistics-Use-Ordinance-and-Guidebook"">Logistics Facilities are Coming.

Moore Township Decision Demonstrates Importance Of Robust Warehouse Ordinances,4/8/2024,"<p>A recent decision by the Northampton County Court of Common Pleas demonstrates how robust zoning ordinances can protect the environment and surrounding communities from the impacts of logistics development.</p><h3><img src=""/Files/Admin/2022%2D09%2D29%5F15%5F43%5F36%5FView%5Fnorth%5Falong%5FPennsylvania%5FState%5FRoute%5F512%5F%28Moorestown%5FDrive%29%5Fjust%5Fnorth%5Fof%5FYost%5FRoad%5Fin%5FMoore%5FTownship%2D%5FNorthampton%5FCounty%2D%5FPennsylvania.jpg"" /></h3><h3>Background</h3><p><br /> Developer Water's Edge at Windgap, LLC (""Water's Edge""), sought to redevelop an existing golf course to build two warehouse buildings with a combined floor area of 488,150 square feet. However, the Township's zoning ordinance constrained the site's developable area by limiting disturbance of steep slopes and woodlands and requiring an earthen berm between the building and the roadway. Seeking to maximize the size of the buildings, the developer challenged these restrictions before the Moore Township zoning hearing board (""ZHB"").</p><p><br /> Ordinance Restrictions Protect the Environment and Community Water's Edge first argued that it should not be required to preserve steep slopes on the property because the existing slopes were ""manmade"" slopes constructed as part of the golf course design, not ""natural"" slopes. The Court agreed with the ZHB that this distinction did not matter, as the Moore Township zoning ordinance did not distinguish between ""manmade"" and ""natural"" slopes. In fact, the Court held, such a distinction would lead to ""thorny-bordering-on-philosophical"" problems, as developers and the Township would be forced to decide the amount of human intervention that would transform a steep slope or other feature from a natural feature into a manmade one.</p><p><br /> The ordinance also required the preservation of at least 60% of the woodland on the site and required a 100-foot wide earthen berm between the building and the road frontage. Water's Edge claimed that it was impossible to comply with both of these provisions because the majority of the woodland on site was located along the road frontage where the berm was to be located. Alternatively, the developer sought a variance from the woodland disturbance requirement, claiming that having to both preserve the woodland and construct a berm was an undue hardship.</p><p><br /> The Court disagreed. It upheld the ZHB's ruling that the developer was required to comply with both the earthen berm requirement and the limitation on woodland disturbance. There was nothing in the ordinance, the Court held, that required the developer to construct the earthen berm immediately adjacent to the roadway, where the woodland was located. The berm could be located anywhere between the building and the road frontage, including between the building and the woodland. Yes, this would likely require the developer to reduce the size of the buildings, but the Court held that this was no hardship, as the developer ""provided no reason, aside from an understandable desire to maximize its profits, why it could not construct a smaller warehouse, build one warehouse rather than two, or otherwise modify its plans to strictly comply with the Zoning Ordinance's required woodland protection rate."" ""Where no hardship is shown,"" the Court concluded, ""or where the asserted hardship amounts to a landowner's desire to increase profitability or maximize development potential, the unnecessary hardship criterion required to obtain a variance is not satisfied.""</p><h3><br /> Power to Restrain Development is Limited Where No Ordinance Requirements Exist</h3><p><br /> This same decision also demonstrates how municipalities' ability to constrain development is limited when that power is not expressly set forth in an ordinance. As with most logistics development, the Water's Edge project was to occur ""on spec,"" meaning that the developer planned to design and construct the facility before identifying a tenant or end user for the space. The ZHB sought to require the developer to identify a specific tenant, asserting that the information was vital to evaluate the effect the development would have on the community, particularly its traffic traffic impacts. The ZHB reasoned that this information was essential because the buildings would be the two largest buildings in the Township, would likely generate the most traffic, and were located several miles from the nearest highway.</p><p><br /> The Court held that the ZHB could not demand this information from the developer because warehouses were a permitted use on the site, and no provision of the zoning ordinance gave the Township the right to deny the project based on traffic concerns or any other consideration beyond the specific requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. When a use is a permitted use, it is allowed by right as long as the developer complies with the specific requirements of the zoning ordinance, even if the resulting development has a substantial adverse impact on the surrounding community. Therefore, the Court held that ""so long as the Zoning Ordinance's dimensional restrictions and other applicable regulations are met, we find no authority to support the notion that the Board may deny permission to an applicant based on a finding that this particular planned warehousing use is exceptionally impactful and worrisome compared to other warehouses.""</p><p><br /> The outcome would be different, the Court opined, if warehouses had been a conditional use or special exception use instead of a permitted use. Approval for these types of uses may be denied if it is demonstrated that the specific development proposed would result in a substantially greater detriment to public health, safety, and welfare than a typical development of that type. Therefore, if warehouses were a conditional use or a special exception use on the property, the ZHB would be justified in seeking more information about the end user of the space and their proposed operations to ascertain the extent of the impact on the public. As it was, however, the ordinance did not give the ZHB that power, and the ZHB would have no lawful use for the requested information. Realizing this issue, Moore Township has since amended its ordinance to designate warehouses as conditional uses wherever they are permitted.</p><h3><br /> PennFuture's Model Logistics Use Ordinance</h3><p><br /> The above case illustrates why PennFuture developed <a href=""/Publication-Living-With-Logistics-A-Model-Logistics-Use-Zoning-Ordinance-for-Pennsylvania-Municipalities"">Living With Logistics: A Model Logistics Use Zoning Ordinance for Pennsylvania Municipalities</a>. Many Pennsylvania municipalities lack the carefully-crafted, robust zoning ordinance provisions necessary to appropriately control the proliferation of logistics uses such as warehouses, distribution centers, and fulfillment centers. Others, like Moore Township when the Water's Edge project was proposed, have ordinances that are strong in some respects but could be strengthened in others. Living with Logistics aims to give municipalities the resources they need to understand the proliferation of logistics development and to craft ordinances that will maximize their power to guide and control it for the benefit of the environment and neighboring residents.<br /></p>",,"Brigitte Meyer, Staff Attorney",,
3 Ways to Advocate for Pennsylvania's Environment,4/2/2024,"<p>Anyone can be an environmental advocate. We, at PennFuture, appreciate you for taking the first step - having an interest in environmental issues.</p><h2>What is Environmental Advocacy?</h2><p>Environmental advocacy involves using your voice to influence public policy at the local, state, and national levels to achieve positive outcomes for the environment and climate.</p><p>While your individual actions in your community matter, the real progress on environmental protection, conservation, and climate change comes from policy shifts: getting stronger regulations and laws that protect water and habitats, limit industrial air pollution, and punish companies who dump toxins into waterways.</p><h2>Ways you can be an Environmental Advocate with PennFuture:</h2><h3><strong>The ACE Program</strong></h3><p>PennFuture's Advocates for Conservation and the Environment volunteers provide local and state lawmakers with the opportunity to learn about environmental issues directly from their own constituents.</p><p>Interested individuals receive guidance from PennFuture staff on how to take the first steps to meet with their local elected officials. These meetings are aimed at building and reinforcing relationships with representatives at the federal and state levels, and are conducted as a grassroots, non-partisan effort.</p><p>ACE volunteers meet with elected officials from both sides of the aisle, regardless of political affiliations, to advocate policy objectives rather than to advance an ideological agenda.</p><p>The PennFuture Civic Engagement Team provides support to the ACE volunteers every step of the way, thus taking on the burden of meeting planning, drafting key talking points, and collecting information on environmental issues.</p><p>""ACE volunteers have played a crucial role in bringing issues such as watershed protection, community solar, and other environmental issues to the forefront of their legislators minds,"" said <strong>Jess Cadorette, Director of Civic Engagement,</strong> ""It is essential for everyday people to voice their concerns about the environment with the elected officials who represent them in order to make progress on these issues.""</p><p>From 2022 to 2023, PennFuture ACE advocates hosted 24 meetings with lawmakers that featured discussions on Solar For Schools legislation, how to improve equity in the delivery of conservation program funds and technical assistance, and understanding the economic and job growth impact of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, among other topics.</p><p><a href=""/join-the-ace-program""><strong>Join the ACE Program</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Writing for Change: Op-Ed & Letters-to-the-Editor Submissions</strong></h3><p>Writing can change minds.

Let the Failed DNA Hydrogen Hub Go and Turn the Page to a Cleaner Future,3/26/2024,"<p>In September 2022, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced that it was soliciting applicants for its <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/oced/regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-0"">Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub Program (H2Hubs)</a>, which would direct billions of dollars to large-scale <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Basics-of-Hydrogen"">hydrogen</a> projects across the nation through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).</p><p>A total of three applications included Pennsylvania:</p><ul><li>ARCH2</li><li>MACH2</li><li>DNA H2Hub</li></ul><p>Each project claimed to leverage Pennsylvanias existing infrastructure, technology expertise, and skilled labor force. The promoters of the DNA project - which was not chosen by DOE to receive federal dollars - are attempting to press on anyway, despite the deep risk of environmental and human harm to Southwestern PA. Why? A peek behind the curtain provides some answers.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.arch2hub.com/"">Appalachia Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub (ARCH2)</a> is a WV-OH-PA-based ""<a href=""https://rmi.org/clean-energy-101-hydrogen/"">blue</a>"" hydrogen project and will utilize fracked-gas methane along with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to produce hydrogen and mitigate carbon emissions. The <a href=""https://mach-2.com/"">Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2)</a> is a PA-NJ-DE-based ""green"" hydrogen project and will utilize renewable energy to produce hydrogen. Both the ARCH2 and MACH2 projects advanced to the next round. However, the <a href=""https://www.decarbonizationnetworkofappalachia.org/"">Decarbonization Network of Appalachia (DNA)</a> project, another blue hydrogen hub based in OH-PA-WV, did not move forward. Getting denied billions of dollars in federal funding would be a good reason to scrap the project and move on, especially when another very similar project located in the same geography is moving forward. But <a href=""https://teampa.com/"">Team PA</a>, DNAs prime applicant, refuses to see the writing on the wall.</p><p>During the application period, Team PA - a peculiar public-private collaborative partnership between interest groups and the Commonwealth and co-chaired by the Governor - aimed to create a project supported by industry and labor that leveraged the Marcellus Shale gas reserves and proximity to Shells ethane cracker plant in Beaver county. The plan was for Team PA to also manage the projects future implementation. Industry leaders involved in the project at varying times included Mitsubishi, <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/rally-against-shell-cracker-plant-monaca-one-year/"">Shell</a>, and Equinor (a Norwegian oil and gas company).</p><p>The DNA H2Hub promised to <a href=""https://teampa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DNAH2HubPublicSummary.pdf"">""unlock affordable, clean hydrogen and decarbonize the supply chains, manufacturing, and power production in America's industrial heartland.""</a> One of the clear goals of this project was to provide methane for polymer manufacturing for plastics production and energy production. This goal would be accomplished by doubling down on the fracked-gas methane production capacity in southwestern Pennsylvania. In essence, the project would seed and ultimately establish an artificial economic life-support system for the failing fracked gas industry, which is struggling to compete with low-cost renewable energy and is suffering from unfavorable market forces.</p><p>Southwestern Pennsylvania is home to some of the <a href=""https://www.lung.org/media/press-releases/pittsburgh-sota-2023#:~:text=The%202023%20%E2%80%9CState%20of%20the,year's%20report%20to%20a%20'C'"">most polluted communities</a> in the nation due to the legacy of steel, plastics, and refining operations based in the region. In fact, it is precisely this industrial history that makes it such an attractive place to try to seed hydrogen, a fuel that can be clean but can also just be a clean facade, or greenwashing. Communities here suffer the consequences of decades of hosting extractive, energy-intensive, and high-pollution industries. While there's no shame in the work folks here have done in the past, it's a simple fact that this legacy has left these communities economically dependent on these industries and struggling to emerge from under their smog-filled shadows. Locating the DNA H2Hub project in the heart of the Marcellus Shale region allows these high-polluting industries to continue this cycle of dependence,and the communities of Southwestern Pennsylvania will continue to be the ones holding the bag.</p><p>The fenceline communities in southwestern Pennsylvania dont want more methane fracked from the ground, transported through leaky pipelines, and converted into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. They want a sustainable and healthy economy based on renewable energy, energy storage, sustainable manufacturing, and family-sustaining union jobs.</p><h2>Blue Hydrogen Fails Economics 101</h2><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Blue%2DHydrogen.jpg"" /></p><p>Even the fossil fuel giants recognize that it is time to flip the switch.

Meanwhile, Equinor, which is Germanys primary source for gas, is collaborating with several other energy companies to field test hydrogen technology - <a href=""https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/hydrogen/abb-joins-hypilot-project-alongside-yara-equinor-20231030"">""ultra-efficient electrolyzers"" with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost and ""facilitating the widespread adoption of large-scale green hydrogen production""</a>.</p><p>Why would these energy titans move their focus overseas to develop green hydrogen when the Marcellus Shale region is drowning in methane? Because they are profit-motivated, and the economics for blue hydrogen <a href=""/Blog-Item-Turning-PA-into-a-Hydrogen-Hub-is-not-a-Sustainable-Energy-Solution"">do not make sense</a>. Equinor, in particular, can attest to the risk involved in developing blue hydrogen at-scale. The international company has <a href=""https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/02/15/experts-sound-alarm-oil-sectors-blue-hydrogen-push/"">a history of failed attempts at CCS projects</a>. The company had to abort a CCS project because <a href=""https://www.tu.no/artikler/to-av-tre-prestisjeprosjekter-for-co2-lagring-er-mislykket/234802"">the reservoir was at risk of collapsing</a>, and a <a href=""https://www.tu.no/artikler/ma-bruke-to-milliarder-kroner-for-a-redde-snohvit-gassen/235227"">second was halted because the injected CO2 was polluting the methane extracted from the site</a>. Whats more, when Equinor was known as Statoil in 2013, it shutdown <a href=""https://www.equinor.com/en/news/archive/2013/09/20/20SepMongstad.html"">its Mongstad CCS plant</a> after just about a year of operation. Through decades of trial and error, Equinor has experienced the economic and technical challenges of blue hydrogen, and rather than continuing to invest in technology that consistently fails in both arenas, it is moving in a new direction.</p><p>Team PA offered a <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/PublicParticipation/Citizens%20Advisory%20Council/CACPortalFiles/Meetings/2024_01/Team%20PA%27s%20Hydrogen%20Presentation%20to%20DEP%20CAC%20-%20Thomas%20Murphy.pdf"">presentation</a> about the MACH2, ARCH2, and DNA hub projects to the Department of Environmental Protections (DEP) <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/PublicParticipation/Citizens%20Advisory%20Council/CACPortalFiles/Meetings/2024_01/January%202024%20CAC%20Agenda%20-%20Version%202.pdf"">Citizens Advisory Council (CAC)</a>. During that presentation, Thomas Murphy, the Senior Managing Director of Strategic Energy Initiatives, said that in spite of two of its major partners pulling out and a lack of federal funding, the organization was moving forward with the project and would continue to collaborate with Mitsubishi. In the face of contrary market forces, lack of government investment, unproven technology, and abandonment by industry leaders, maddeningly, Team PA insists on doubling down on methane-derived hydrogen.</p><p>The bottom line is that blue hydrogen isn't climate friendly. Even when operating at its most efficient, experts argue that the blue hydrogen technology available right now is only 78% effective at capturing its carbon emissions. It takes additional energy input for carbon capture technology to run, which means that <a href=""https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/02/15/experts-sound-alarm-oil-sectors-blue-hydrogen-push/"">""due to the increased amount of fossil gas needed to power the CCS process, blue hydrogen likely had a 20% higher carbon footprint than burning methane alone.""</a> This should be said again: blue hydrogen, which supposedly takes a high impact fuel and makes it lower-impact, actually has a higher footprint than if it was never created in the first place. This is why groups like PennFuture are calling for <a href=""/Blog-Item-Chasing-the-Rainbow-Carbon-Capture-is-Magic-Thinking"">investment in renewables first</a>, before throwing good money at bad technologies that perpetuate fracking and all of the negative health outcomes and economic failures that come with it.</p><h2>The DNA Hub Will Only Perpetuate the Harms of the Past</h2><p>Team PA claimed that the DNA hub would improve the economic conditions for workers by providing good-paying jobs for a ""marginalized, underserved, and fossil fuel-dependent region."" In reality, it would maintain the status quo by offering the same hollow promises that the fossil fuel industry has offered for centuries, refusing to acknowledge the real threats that this project poses to the environment and, consequently, to workers and local communities. Simply put, the DNA H2Hub, if completed, will perpetuate the boom-bust economic cycle created by the extraction of both fossil fuel and labor resources with detrimental environmental and health consequences.</p><p>It would behoove Team PA, the Commonwealth, fenceline communities, and workers to follow Equinors lead. Pennsylvanians - especially the most vulnerable, disaffected, and disenfranchised among us - do not need more empty promises and cycles of a boom-bust economy. We need a stable economy, a stable climate, and a healthy environment. Ironically, fossil fuels seem to be going the way of the dinosaur. And yet Team PA seems unwilling to recognize this fact.</p><p>Pennsylvania needs Team PA to read the writing on the wall and pivot. They need to focus on serving the residents and workers of the Commonwealth, instead of chasing a scheme designed to keep the fracked gas industry afloat and distracting from real solutions like renewables, battery storage, and building a sustainable economy.</p><p>Going forward PennFuture will be focusing our efforts on pushing Pennsylvania towards a better economic future.

The People Have A Right: A Brief Overview Of Environmental Rights Amendment Case Law,3/25/2024,"<p>Pennsylvanias Constitution provides a unique Environmental Rights Amendment that guarantees our right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment and requires the Commonwealth to conserve and maintain Pennsylvania's public natural resources for the benefit of all people. Since the ERA's adoption in 1971, Pennsylvania courts have had the task of determining what it means. PennFuture constructs a brief history of the Environmental Rights Amendment court cases and the decisions that interpret and apply this important law.</p><h2><br /> In the Beginning</h2><p><br /><strong>Commonwealth v. National Gettysburg Battlefield Tower, 311 A.2d 588 (Pa. 1973)</strong></p><p><br /> In one of the earliest cases brought under the ERA, the Attorney General sought to prevent a private company from constructing a 307-foot observation tower 700 feet from Gettysburg National Military Park. The Attorney General argued that the tower violated the ERA because it would despoil the natural and historic values of the battlefield. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the ERA did not, by itself, allow the government to stop the actions of private parties in the absence of some other law prohibiting the activity. Since the ERA does not define things like ""clean air,"" ""pure water"" and ""historic value,"" allowing the government to bring suit against private parties for interfering with those values would mean that ""individuals could be singled out for interference by the awesome power of the state with no advance warning that their conduct would lead to such consequences.""</p><h2>The Payne Era</h2><p><strong>Payne v. Kassab, 312 A.2d 86 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1973), affirmed by Payne v. Kassab, 361 A.2d 263 (Pa. 1976)</strong><br /></p><p>The next major ERA decision came in 1976. Residents of Wilkes-Barre claimed that the ERA prevented PennDOT from paving over a portion of a public park to widen a highway because doing so would harm the historic value of the park. The Commonwealth Court rejected ""such an absolute interpretation"" of the ERA and instead held that the ERA was intended to allow ""controlled development of resources rather than no development."" The Court concluded that the ERA requires a balancing of environmental concerns and other legitimate government interests. It also devised a three-part test to assess whether the proper balancing had taken place. This test, which came to be known as the <em><strong>Payne test</strong></em>, asks:</p><ol><li>Was there compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations relevant to the protection of the Commonwealth's public natural resources?</li><li>Does the record demonstrate a reasonable effort to reduce the environmental incursion to a minimum?</li><li>Does the environmental harm which will result from the challenged decision or action so clearly outweigh the benefits to be derived therefrom that to proceed further would be an abuse of discretion?</li></ol><p>The Court held that the paving of a portion of the park to widen the highway satisfied this test and was thus permissible under the ERA. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not explicitly affirm the Commonwealth Court's three-part test but agreed with the lower court that ""it is manifest that a balancing must take place"" between the environmental values protected by the ERA and other important societal values.</p><p>The Commonwealth Court's decision in <strong>Payne v. Kassab</strong> ushered in a nearly forty-year period of failed ERA claims. Because the first prong of the Payne test asks whether the challenged action complies with all applicable statutes and regulations, the question of whether any particular action violated the ERA effectively collapsed into the question of whether the action complied with other environmental laws. Under the Payne test, where no other law was violated, the ERA provided no additional protection for the environment. In addition, the Payne test effectively dictated that no action could violate the ERA unless the environmental harm ""clearly outweighed"" any benefit to be gained by the action. In practice, courts rarely found this to be the case.</p><p>Other important decisions also came out of the Payne era, for example:</p><p><strong>Community College of Delaware County v. Fox, 342 A.2d 468 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1975)</strong></p><p>Residents argued that the Department of Environmental Resources (DER) violated the ERA by issuing a permit allowing the Central Delaware County Authority to expand sewer service. The residents argued that the permit would induce additional development in environmentally sensitive areas, leading to potential water pollution effects. The Commonwealth Court rejected this argument because it concluded that the ERA cannot expand the powers of a state agency like DER. Instead, the ERA operates ""only to limit such powers as have been expressly delegated by proper enabling legislation."" The General Assembly had not given DER the authority to consider the effect of future land development when deciding whether to issue permits, so the ERA could not be used to compel DER to consider or make decisions based on such concerns.</p><h2>Robinson Township</h2><p><strong>Robinson Township v. Commonwealth, 83 A.3d 901 (2013)</strong></p><p><br /> In 2013, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reinvigorated the ERA with its decision in <strong>Robinson Township v. Commonwealth</strong>. In this case, several municipalities, environmental advocacy organizations, and other parties challenged amendments to the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Act, known as Act 13. Among other things, the challengers argued that Act 13 violated the ERA because it forced every municipality in the Commonwealth to allow oil and gas drilling by right in all zoning districts. </p><p>In its decision, the Court opined that the Commonwealth Court's ERA decisions up until that point had weakened the meaning of the ERA by tending to define the ERA's broad constitutional rights in terms of compliance with various other laws. It criticized the Payne test, saying that it was not based on the text of the ERA, improperly narrowed the scope of the ERA, and minimized the constitutional duties of the non-legislative branches of government. A better analytical scheme was needed.</p><p>Providing that analytical scheme, the Court explained that the ERA is structured in ""three mandatory clauses that define rights and obligations."" The first clause establishes Pennsylvanians' right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic values of the environment. It operates to protect the people from governmental action that unreasonably causes actual or likely deterioration of these features. This clause does not impose an express duty on the government to enact specific affirmative measures to promote clean air, pure water, and the preservation of different values of the environment, but it does impose an obligation to refrain from unduly infringing upon that right by legislative or executive action.</p><p>The second and third clauses work together. The second clause guarantees the common ownership of the people, including future generations, of Pennsylvania's public natural resources. This applies to a narrower category of ""public"" natural resources than is covered by the first clause, but nevertheless implicates relatively broad aspects of the environment, including state-owned lands and other resources that ""implicate the public interest"" such as ambient air, surface and ground water, and wild plants and animals.</p><p>The third clause establishes a public trust-a type of legal relationship whereby the Commonwealth as ""trustee"" must conserve and maintain Pennsylvania's public natural resources (called the ""corpus"" of the trust) for the benefit of all Pennsylvanians, present and future, referred to as ""beneficiaries"" of the trust. The Court explained that this means that the Commonwealth has a duty to conserve and maintain Pennsylvania's public natural resources with prudence, loyalty and impartiality. It also means that the Commonwealth must prevent and remedy degradation, diminution, and depletion of those resources, whether they occur through direct state action or due to the state's failure to restrain the actions of private parties. The Commonwealth's trustee obligations are both negative and affirmative, meaning that the Commonwealth not only has a duty to prevent degradation of public natural resources, but to act affirmatively to protect the environment by passing laws.</p><p>The Court went on to caution that the ERA does not call for a stagnant landscape, the derailment of economic or social development, or the sacrifice of other fundamental values. It is not intended to stop development. Rather, the ERA means that economic development cannot take place at the expense of unreasonable degradation of the environment.</p><p>The Court also explained that the ERA imposes obligations and limitations on all branches and levels of government-including local government-because the quality of the environment is a task with both local and statewide implications. Because the ERA is a constitutional command, the General Assembly cannot take away local governments' responsibilities under it, nor can it remove the necessary and reasonable authority local governments need to carry out their constitutional duties. Therefore, the Court held, the portion of Act 13 that removed local governments' authority to decide where oil and gas operations may be located within their boundaries violated the ERA and must be struck down. </p><h2><br /> Post-Robinson Township</h2><p>Only three of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's seven justices agreed with the reasoning in Robinson Township, although a fourth agreed with the outcome based on a different rationale. This meant that the provisions of Act 13 that forced municipalities to allow oil and gas development in all zoning districts were invalidated, but the Court's analysis of the ERA did not become binding precedent on lower courts. Because a majority of the Supreme Court had not conclusively rejected the Payne test, the Commonwealth Court continued to apply it for several more years, until the Supreme Court definitively rejected it in a case known as PEDF II.</p><h2>PEDF II</h2><p><strong>Pa. Envtl. Def. Found. v. Commonwealth, 161 A.3d 911 (Pa. 2017) (PEDF II)</strong></p><p>The next significant ERA decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court came in 2017. In this case, the Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Fund (PEDF) challenged the leasing of state-owned land for oil and natural gas development and the budgetary scheme that dispersed the revenue from those leases. This scheme redirected over $330 million that would have been used for conservation purposes under prior law to the General Fund, where it was appropriated for a variety of state government purposes unrelated to maintaining and protecting public natural resources.</p><p>The Court began its analysis by decisively rejecting the Payne test, stating that it was unrelated to the text of the ERA and stripped the ERA of its meaning. This time, four Supreme Court justices agreed with this holding, finally spelling the end of the Payne test. The four-justice majority also affirmed Robinson Township's statement of basic ERA principles, thus solidifying those principles into binding precedent. The Court went on to elaborate on the Commonwealth's trustee duties, firmly grounding these in private trust law. These duties include the duty of loyalty, which imposes an obligation to manage the corpus of the trust so as to accomplish the trust's purposes for the benefit of the trust's beneficiaries, and the duty of impartiality to treat all beneficiaries equitably in light of the purposes of the trust. The Commonwealth's discretion as to how to handle Pennsylvania's public natural resources is limited by these trustee duties and the purpose of the trust.</p><p>The Court also held that the proceeds from the sale of public natural resources, including the sale of oil and gas from public lands, are to be considered part of the corpus of the trust and must be dealt with in the same way as other public natural resources. Therefore, the Commonwealth is not entitled to spend that revenue on general budgetary items in any way it sees fit; those funds must be directed toward the purpose of the trust-conserving and maintaining Pennsylvania's public natural resources. Accordingly, the Court held that the budgetary provisions that took revenue generated from the sale of oil and gas on state lands and placed them in the General Fund without requiring the Commonwealth to put them toward conserving and maintaining public natural resources violated the ERA.</p><p>The remainder of the Court's decision, as well as several subsequent decisions, dealt primarily with characterizing the precise nature of the revenue generated by oil and gas leases and the precise scope of the activities that could be funded with that revenue. For example, in a later case, <strong>Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Foundation v. Commonwealth, 279 A.3d 1194 (Pa. 2022)</strong>, the Supreme Court held that a trustee is entitled to incur reasonable costs in administering the trust, and, therefore, oil and gas revenues could be used to fund general operating expenses of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources such as salaries, wages, and travel expenses for its employees.</p><h2>Recent Cases</h2><p>In the years since Robinson Township and the PEDF cases, Courts have tended to focus on language in those two seminal cases stating that the ERA protects only against unreasonable degradation of natural resources and ""does not call for a stagnant landscape"" or ""require a freeze of the existing natural resource stock."" Although Payne's explicit balancing test has gone by the wayside, courts have continued to view the Commonwealth's ERA obligations in terms of a balance between the duty to maintain and conserve natural resources for the benefit of all the people and other legitimate government interests. The effect has been that, when specific government actions have been challenged, courts have focused on whether the challenged action represents an appropriate balance between environmental interests and other concerns or is instead an unreasonable degradation of the environment. In nearly all cases, courts have decided that the appropriate balance has been struck and no unreasonable degradation has or will occur. Often, these decisions have resulted from what courts or local decision-making bodies have found to be inadequate evidence of alleged environmental harms. </p><p>One such case is <strong>Frederick v. Allegheny Twp. Zoning Hearing Bd., 196 A.3d 677 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018)</strong>. In this case, residents of Allegheny Township challenged a zoning ordinance that permitted fracking by right in all zoning districts, subject to various restrictions. The Commonwealth Court held that the challengers had not produced sufficient evidence that fracking was harmful to the environment or public health and, even if they had, Township had appropriately balanced those concerns against the economic benefits of fracking.</p><p>Courts have also doubled down on the principle, first articulated in <strong>Community College of Delaware County v. Fox</strong> in 1975, that the ERA does not give executive branch agencies like the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) additional powers or authority beyond what the General Assembly has given them by statute. On multiple occasions, courts have held that DEP and other agencies like it cannot create regulations, make decisions, issue or deny permits, or take any other actions based on ERA concerns if there is no state statute allowing them to do so. For example, the Commonwealth Court in <strong>Marcellus Shale Coalition v. Department of Environmental Protection, 193 A.3d 447 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018)</strong>, invalidated a regulation that required DEP to consider impacts to species of special concern when issuing permits for oil and gas development because the statute that created the permitting scheme only authorized DEP to consider impacts to endangered and threatened species.</p><p>The same applies to municipalities, who cannot act beyond the powers given to them by the General Assembly. For example, in <strong>Frederick v. Allegheny Township</strong>, the Court held that municipalities lack the power to replicate the environmental oversight that the General Assembly has conferred upon DEP and other state agencies.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Courts continue to wrestle with the ERA and the implications of Robinson Township and PEDF II. Courts have never directly addressed what preservation of the ""scenic"" and ""esthetic"" values of the environment means. The scope of what constitutes ""public natural resources"" also remains largely unexplored. Questions remain as to the nature of the Commonwealth's duty to act affirmatively to protect the environment by passing laws. Few cases have delved deeply into the question of what ""prudence, loyalty, and impartiality"" look like in the context of preserving and maintaining public natural resources. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not elaborated on the proper approach to balancing the rights guaranteed by the ERA with other legitimate government interests like promoting economic development, and it is unknown whether it will approve of the two-part test created by the Commonwealth Court in Frederick Township.</p><p>As these questions percolate through the courts, PennFuture's legal team is dedicated to protecting and defending our fundamental constitutional right to a healthy environment through litigation and regulatory commenting.

"The Delaware River has a pollution problem, and PWD can't scare it into going away",2/23/2024,"<p>Philadelphians received a troubling email from the water department over Presidents Day weekend, threatening higher water rates. Proposed new water quality standards will require the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) to reduce the pollution it discharges into the Delaware River in order to help improve water quality and save the endangered Atlantic Sturgeon. Instead of explaining this, PWD attempted to scare its customers and policymakers by tying a cleaner Delaware River to high rates. This is unconscionably false, and the PWD's missive failed to mention the pollution problem in the Delaware River it helped create, and used misinformed data to rile up ratepayers. If you got this email, you may have asked yourself, ""Why is my water department telling me that the benefits of clean water dont outweigh the costs?""</p><h3><strong>Excuse Me, How Much?</strong></h3><p>PWD operates three wastewater treatment plants on the River:</p><ul><li>Northeast Water Pollution Control Plant</li><li>Southeast Water Pollution Control Plant</li><li>Southwest Water Pollution Control Plant</li></ul><p>It needs to upgrade these plants to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s proposed new water quality standards. In its recent communications to ratepayers, PWD alleged that these upgrades would cost $3 billion and that PWD would raise rates by $265 per year to pay for them. These amounts are outdated, based on false assumptions, and designed to make Philadelphians afraid.</p><h3><strong>What Happened: The EPAs Involvement in the Delaware River</strong></h3><p>In December 2022, <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-and-Partners-Convince-EPA-to-Upgrade-Delaware-River-Water-Quality-Standards"">EPA granted PennFuture's and our partners petition</a> for a rulemaking to establish new water quality standards under the Clean Water Act for dissolved oxygen in the urban Delaware River. In layman's terms, the wastewater treatment plants along the Delaware River are old and using outdated technology. As a result, they fail to capture all of the pollution that enters it and instead dump that pollution into the river, including dangerous substances like ammonia, which dramatically lowers the amount of oxygen in the river through a process called ""nitrification."" This ensures that the river is not suitable for most wildlife to live-including the endangered Atlantic Sturgeon-as well as people to use the river for recreation. In other words, this pollution leads to the Delaware River being a deadzone in and around Philadelphia.</p><p>Then, in December 2023, <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/21/2023-27758/water-quality-standards-to-protect-aquatic-life-in-the-delaware-river"">EPA released a draft of revised standards for public comment</a>. With barely 48 hours remaining in the comment period, PWD chose to push out misleading information to its ratepayers, attacking the science behind the new standards, and claiming that it would enact exorbitant rate increases.</p><p>This is misinformation. PWDs scare tactics, financial threats, and ""either/or"" mindset do a disservice to Philadelphians who deserve a clean and healthy river. Philadelphians should not have to worry about whether their water provider is trying to fight against clean water.</p><h3><strong>The Science is Clear!</strong></h3><p>The major government agencies-EPA and the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC)- that watch over the Delaware River agree. Wildlife, including the endangered Atlantic Sturgeon, live in the urban reaches of the Delaware River, and they need higher <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/indicators-dissolved-oxygen"">dissolved oxygen</a> regularly to thrive. Stronger water quality standards that reduce pollution in the river and increase dissolved oxygen levels are essential to restore these majestic creatures to full population health, protect other fish vital to the river ecosystem, and support recreational and commercial fishing. You can read more about this in <a href=""/Files/Admin/2024.2.20%2DFinal%2DJoint%2DEPA%2DProposed%2DWQS%2DComments.pdf"">PennFuture's comments</a>.</p><p>Of course, getting the water to hold higher dissolved oxygen levels does not happen overnight. The dissolved oxygen levels in the Delaware River are low because of discharges from wastewater treatment plants.</p><p>To prevent this nitrification process from happening in the Delaware River, PWD needs to upgrade their wastewater treatment plants. The plants need to reduce the amount of ammonia they discharge, or nitrify it, before discharging it so it wont pull dissolved oxygen out of the Delaware River.</p><h3><strong>PWDs Eye-Popping $3 Billion Cost Estimate Is Too Bad To Be True</strong></h3><p>PWD's email to ratepayers told them that it would cost $3 billion to upgrade its three facilities. That number sounds shocking. PWD <a href=""https://delawarecurrents.org/2021/03/24/delaware-river-dissolved-oxygen/"">linked to some sources</a> connecting to a report that the <a href=""https://www.nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/NitrogenReductionCostEstimates_KleinfelderJan2021.pdf"">DRBC commissioned in 2021</a> to estimate conservative upgrade costs for PWD's plants, under four possible scenarios-and PWD's number only looks at the most expensive one. Again, this number is not based on the cost of the actual proposed regulation. A more realistic estimate would look at the specific requirements of the proposed regulation. What PWD has done here is like getting a single quote for a home-improvement project where you include every possible upgrade, just to see how much it'd all cost.</p><p>Importantly, EPA provided a different estimate for the costs of upgrading. <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/21/2023-27758/water-quality-standards-to-protect-aquatic-life-in-the-delaware-river"">EPAs estimate</a> for upgrading all of the impacted wastewater treatment plants-only three of which are PWD's-is $137 million per year. Let's repeat that: That is $137 million for all the plants along this stretch of the Delaware. EPA estimates that PWD's three plants will require approximately $78 million per year. But PWD told ratepayers it needs $3 billion for just its three plants and didn't provide ratepayers any sense of what that could mean per year. The math doesn't add up!</p><p>PWD didn't tell ratepayers, but later in the week wrote in its official comments to EPA, that it commissioned its own studies to get its own cost estimates. However, PWD hasn't made it clear what the basis is for its estimates. Without understanding how PWD got to the numbers it did, it is hard for anyone else to evaluate what the costs are and how to pay for them.</p><h3><strong>Why Water Rates Dont Need To Increase</strong></h3><p>Here's the kicker: PWD does not have to raise rates to pay for all of these upgrades. It can take advantage of significant state and federal infrastructure funding. Funds are available through several federal programs-the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and other sources-to make the necessary improvements to its wastewater treatment plants.</p><p>Municipalities and utilities like PWD have the opportunity to access federal funds for system upgrades. On February 20, 2024, <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-58-billion-president-bidens-investing-america"">the Biden administration announced over $5.8 billion</a> for states, Tribes, and territories to invest in drinking water and clean water infrastructure upgrades. The funding focuses on essential water infrastructure that protects public health and treasured water bodies nationwide. Almost half of this funding will be available as grants or principal forgiveness loans, ensuring funds reach underserved communities most in need of investments in water infrastructure.</p><p>In total, the Biden administration has invested $50 billion in the nations water infrastructure through the BIL. Pennsylvanias water infrastructure has already benefited-<a href=""https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-200-million-pennsylvania-drinking-water"">receiving $782,982,000 in investments from the BIL since 2022</a>.</p><p>The ARPA is another source of federal funds. Philadelphia received $1.4 billion from the federal government via ARPA to assist with relief efforts related to the COVID-19 pandemic and recession, and to invest in its water infrastructure. <strong>Philadelphia</strong><a href=""https://www.phila.gov/2022-11-03-what-the-american-rescue-plan-means-for-philadelphia/""><strong>must allocate $449 million by the end of this year</strong></a>. <strong>To date, it has not done so</strong>.</p><p>Philadelphia can use the ARPA funding to invest in long-term upgrades to our aging water infrastructure system and reduce the need to fund these projects through debt service or rate increases. It can do all this without negatively impacting PWD's ability to borrow money at the most favorable rates.</p><p>Indeed, PWD has already planned to do at least a portion of this work. PWD intends to <a href=""https://water.phila.gov/drops/virtual-presentation-for-planned-deammonification/"">build a sidestream treatment facility</a> to reduce the ammonia load moving through the Southwest Water Pollution Control Plant. PWDs own estimates are that this sidestream plant will solve 10% of the ammonia problem by itself. PWD plans to pay for this through a grant from Pennsylvanias PENNVEST fund, not through an increase in water rates.</p><h3><strong>Philadelphia Can-And Should-Have Both a Healthy Delaware AND Affordable Water Rates</strong></h3><p>PWD's actions to set up a false narrative is a loss for us all and greatly reduces our confidence in its ability to manage Philadelphia's aging water system. To start rebuilding trust, PWD should publicly rescind its e-mail and update its information to reflect the truth-upgrading its three wastewater treatment plants is necessary and can be done without raising water rates.</p><p>We all want the same thing-a healthy Delaware and affordable water rates. Instead of fear-mongering, PWD should figure out how to make the river cleaner and healthier and what resources are available to help fund that work. PennFuture will continue to hold PWD accountable for equitable rates and a healthy and productive Delaware River. Millions of people use the river for recreation, food, and work. Our goal is to ensure they can do so for years to come.</p>",Environment,"Emma Bast, Staff Attorney; Jessica O'Neill, Senior Attorney",,
"Zoning, Not Popular Vote, Should Determine 'Warehouse' Development",2/8/2024,"<div><span>A recently-proposed bill in the Pennsylvania legislature has attracted the attention of residents concerned about the proliferation of logistics facilities such as warehouses and distribution centers. This bill (HB 1960), proposed by Rep. Emrick of Lower Nazareth, Northampton County, would subject local land development approval of certain warehouses and distribution centers to a public referendum, effectively giving the public standardless veto power over this type of development. While this bill reflects an admirable response to community outcry and a desire for more control over a form of development that can cause significant traffic, aesthetic, health, and environmental impacts, the mechanism it offers misses the mark.</span></div><div>To see why this is the case, consider an illustration: You are driving through an unfamiliar town and see that the posted speed limit is 45 mph. You are cruising along at 40 mph and obeying all known traffic laws, so you are surprised when a police officer pulls you over and writes you a ticket. ""What's the problem, officer?"" you ask, ""The sign says the speed limit is 45 mph. I was only going 40 and haven't done anything else illegal that I know of.""</div><div>""I know,"" says the police officer, ""but, we have a law that says that a driver can be ticketed if local residents don't approve of the way they are driving, even if they are following the traffic laws. Some of the folks who live on this street called the station and said they didn't like how fast you were going, so I have to write you a ticket.""</div><div>""That's not fair!"" you exclaim. ""You're telling me I can get a ticket just because local residents 'don't like' how I'm driving?! How am I supposed to know what kind of driving they'll approve of? What keeps me from getting a ticket just because they don't like my car or the way I look?! How do I know they won't change their mind about what they approve of next time I drive through here?! If they wanted the speed limit to be lower, they should have gotten the law changed and put up new signs!""</div><div>""Maybe,"" says the police officer with a shrug, ""but they're the ones who live here and they agreed they don't like the way you're driving today, so that's the way it is. Have a nice day.""</div><div>If you were this driver, you would be right to think this was unfair. Most of us understand that we have a right to know ahead of time whether our actions are lawful and what specific standards we must follow to comply with the law. We have a right not to be subject to the whims of our neighbors on a case-by-case basis. In fact, this right is so fundamental to our understanding of how society works that it is enshrined in a constitutional amendment that prohibits deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. In the context of land development, due process means that a person's right to use and develop their property cannot be subject to arbitrary, standardless, case-by-case decision making, even if the decision makers are neighbors and community members.</div><div>This is why the type of public referendum put forth by HB 1960 cannot be the mechanism used to control logistics development. Neither landowners nor the community would know ahead of time what type of development would be permitted, and voters could reject or approve a proposed development for any number of reasons, including unfair and unlawful ones. Voters could reject a proposed development simply because they don't think the developer is the ""right"" kind of person, because they think their brother-in-law should get to develop the property instead, or because they think a different type of development would be more attractive or personally beneficial to them. Public referendums would also invite unsavory politicking by developers, who may try to influence voting with bribes or other unlawful incentives. All of this would amount to a deprivation of property rights in violation of due process.</div><div>But neighbors and community members do have a say in how our communities are developed. Communities' ability to guide and control logistics development resides not in public veto power over individual projects, but, as it always has, in municipalities' power to adopt zoning and land development ordinances. These ordinances set forth the standards governing land use and development so that everyone-land developers, decision-makers, and community members alike-know the rules ahead of time and apply them fairly to all comers. Clear standards, set forth in ordinances and applied by local decision-making bodies in public proceedings, prevent the kind of ""arbitrary and capricious"" decision-making that results from standardless public referendums. Landowners can consult ordinances and know with confidence what will and will not be permitted on their land, and neighboring community members can consult them to see what kind of land use and development they can reasonably expect on nearby properties.</div><div>Although ordinances may not seem as ""sexy"" as a direct public vote on individual logistics development projects, they can accomplish the same goals while keeping the appropriate constitutional safeguards in place. Through ordinances, municipalities can dictate where within a municipality logistics uses may be constructed and impose restrictions to ensure that the significant impacts caused by these facilities are appropriately minimized and mitigated. Pennsylvania residents who are concerned about the impacts of logistics development on their communities should encourage their local officials to review their land use ordinances and determine whether updates are necessary to appropriately control this development. PennFuture has drafted a <a href=""/files/galleries/PennFuture_Ordinance_Manual_7.pdf"">model ordinance and guidebook</a> as well as a community toolkit for just this purpose.</div><div>PennFuture applauds state and local officials like Rep. Emrick who have engaged with the issue of logistics development and listened to community members who desire more control over this highly impactful form of land use. While public referendums may not be the solution, Pennsylvania municipalities and residents still have the power to guide and control this development while protecting their communities and the environment from harm. We will continue to work with community members and state and local elected officials to see that this is accomplished.</div>",Community,"Brigitte Meyer, Staff Attorney",,
