From the CEO: PennFuture Priorities in 2018,12/19/2017,"<p>The PennFuture staff has been reflecting on 2017 as the year comes to an end. Many of us and our supporters tend to view the year as one marked by profound threats &ndash; to our climate system and our children&rsquo;sfutures, to our democracy, and to the institutions and laws that give us some measure of protection from pollution. Indeed, the year was marked by all of that, but also by counterbalances that can end up being similarly profound.</p>

<p>With the president&rsquo;s <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Statement-on-Paris-Climate-Agreement-Withdrawal"">withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Climate Accord</a>, we&rsquo;ve seen the Paris to Pittsburgh movement take shape, culminating in former Vice President Al Gore and the Heinz Endowments&rsquo; hosting of the largest ever Climate Reality Project training in Pittsburgh this past October. As a result, we have hundreds of new climate communicators in our state, ready to deploy and bring solid information about the climate crisis and its solutions to the public.</p>

<p>We have seen the PA State Supreme Court issue a second important opinion in <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-State-Supreme-Court-Rules-Leasing-Public-Land-for-Fracking-Betrayed-Governments-Constitutional-Duties""><em>PEDF v. Tom Wolf, Governor and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</em></a>, building favorable case law around the Environmental Rights Amendment to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Constitution. And the gerrymandering movement has tremendous momentum.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen environmental issues influence elections in places like Delaware County and Jessup, where voters turned pro-pipeline and pro-gas elected officials out of office and replaced them with clean energy visionaries.</p>

<p><strong>We are entering 2018 with a wind at our backs. Here is a look at PennFuture&rsquo;s priorities for the coming year:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Clean Energy Cities Initiative</strong><br />
In the wake of the Paris withdrawal, we&rsquo;ve witnessed Pennsylvania communities and elected officials step up by taking pledges and other actions that indicate their seriousness in taking their climate future into their own hands. What comes next for these communities, especially smaller ones that are willing but perhaps lacking the expertise and resources to take the next big step into renewables and energy efficiency? <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/careers-and-internships"">PennFuture is piloting a program in Pittsburgh</a> that we hope to expand to three new communities as support grows. PennFuture will be on the ground in communities, ready to offer technical and planning assistance, help design projects and find resources to move communities aggressively in the new energy space, bypassing the anti-environmental forces and climate deniers trying to hold this unstoppable movement down.</p>

<p><strong>Green in &rsquo;18 Campaign</strong><br />
As part of our new civic engagement program, formed as a result of our January 2017 strategic alliance with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/careers-and-internships"">PennFuture will launch its Green in &rsquo;18 campaign.</a> The campaign will elevate the public discussion around environmental issues in the upcoming elections. PennFuture and Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania are working with more than 30 environmental, land, water and recreation groups to design a common agenda of priority issues for our organizations. The Green in &rsquo;18 campaign will focus its attention on these issue priorities and find opportunities for all candidates in key elections to react to and discuss key issues in the water, air, and energy arenas.</p>

<p><strong>Using the Courts</strong><br />
PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team plans to explore ideas to be more creative and aggressive with our litigation activity. We will continue our good work in the enforcement and regulatory arenas, but can we push harder on litigation around the Environmental Rights Amendment and climate issues? PennFuture&rsquo;s legacy of impact around our legal work has been defined by selecting smart cases that have broad implications. We want our work defined by that criteria, but we want to use the courts fully, especially in times like these when the legislature is actively stymying our ability to advance a clean water, clean air, and clean energy agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Restoring the Ohio River Basin</strong><br />
The Ohio River is at a critical juncture, again named America&rsquo;s most polluted river according to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Toxics Release Inventory. But in comparison to our other great river systems, the Ohio Basin is underserved, especially when considering the threat of a multi-state petrochemical complex that will further degrade the basin&rsquo;s air, water and public health.</p>

<p>PennFuture currently is part of two large, multi-state coalitions working to protect local waters of the Delaware River, and the Susquehanna River, respectively. As part of these coalitions, PennFuture is coordinating a large number of state, regional and local groups active in Pennsylvania and in these two major watersheds. PennFuture and National Wildlife Federation seek to begin a closer examination of threats to the Ohio, and working with other organizations, academics and resource managers, begin to craft pathways to environmental health and economic prosperity.</p>

<p><strong>Your Support Makes it Possible</strong><br />
We hope you find these upcoming undertakings of PennFuture worthwhile and exciting, and worthy of your advocacy support and <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/donate"">financial investment in 2018</a>. This list only reflects a small portion of the excellent and impactful work and campaigns that will continue in 2018.</p>

<p>We will continue to build our presence in mid-size towns and communities throughout our state. We will put forth solutions and alternatives to economic development defined by dirty energy. Thank you for supporting our Toxic Neighbor campaign to protect Pittsburgh&rsquo;s air from polluters like U.S. Steel and Royal Dutch Shell. Thank you for supporting our newest office and staff in Mount Pocono, where we are working to protect the headwater streams of the Delaware River Basin. Thank you for making our ability to represent clients through our legal services a reality.</p>

<p>We have a big year planned, and I hope to see you along the way, perhaps at our Women In Conservation event in the Philadelphia area in April, or at our Fall 2018 Solar Tour in Pittsburgh. Together, we will continue to make a difference.</p>

Chesapeake Bay Efforts Headed in Right Direction for 2018,12/18/2017,"<p>As we approach the end of this crucial year for the Chesapeake Bay clean-up and efforts to meet its pollution reduction goals, Pennsylvania has taken a number of actions over the last month to capture the status of the state and provide input to the Environmental Protection Agency for the Total Maximum Daily Load&rsquo;s mid-point assessment.</p>

<p>Halfway to 2025, the decisions and efforts Bay watershed states make in 2018 will ensure that they remain (or get on track) to meeting those pollution reduction goals.</p>

<p>In November, the Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) Steering Committee for Pennsylvania recommended to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) that local goals for the WIP should be developed at the county scale and the level of effort for the Bay planning targets should be equal for all jurisdictions in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.</p>

<p>These decisions should be applauded, because they are strong, but feasible and realistic policy decisions for implementing changes and best management practices for Pennsylvania. Rich Batiuk at the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) office shared that he believes this was the right way for the Commonwealth, but recent discussions with EPA CBP Director Nicholas DiPasquale remind stakeholders that Pennsylvania should not lose sight of keeping a strong focus on York and Lancaster Counties specifically. Intentional and intensive focus must remain on the South Central Pennsylvania counties, which contribute the most load (nutrient pollutants and sediment) to the Susquehanna and Potomac River basins.</p>

<p>Over the last several months, DEP and EPA have collected &ndash; and continue to collect - a significant amount of data and continuously monitor and analyze information to better perform and make public policy decisions. But, it is important to effectively target and prioritize available funding, technical, and human resources. It is becoming more evident that Pennsylvania should leverage relationships with public-private partnerships, involve the private sector to meet goals, and include innovative technology in its path forward, but these strategies and tactics must be proven to work and be equitable.</p>

<p>At last week&rsquo;s December WIP Steering Committee meeting, stakeholders discussed other essential issues that need to be resolved for the Mid-Point Assessment of the Bay Program. Among these are Pennsylvania&rsquo;s take on the effects of climate change on the Bay watershed, sector growth, and the issue of the Conowingo Dam on the Susquehanna River.</p>

<p>While these are large topics that encompass a great deal of uncertainty, changing landscapes and input needs, Pennsylvania must step up and be a strong leader on climate change in the next WIP and its actions moving forward in the Chesapeake Bay clean-up. Though it should be a team effort with New York and Maryland, addressing the overflowing of sedimentation and pollutants at the Conowingo Dam must include Pennsylvania as an equal party to provide support in finding a solution.</p>

<p>In terms of sector growth, it is imperative that the Commonwealth be thoughtful and include its ramifications in all planning processes. Tomorrow, the Principals&rsquo; Staff Committee of the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program meets to take action on the TMDL mid-point assessment, and we urge strong policies be enacted on climate change, the Conowingo Dam, and growth in the Bay watershed.</p>

<p>It is long past time for Pennsylvania to step up and be a leader in the Chesapeake Bay clean-up, but recent actions provide some hope for next steps. As stakeholders and citizen advocates, we must continue to remind our legislators and executive officials that clean water matters in Pennsylvania. To restore and steward our beloved watersheds in the Commonwealth, we must hold fast our engagement and commitment to rigorous planning goals and targets.</p>

<p>Beside all requirements and goals, I long for the day I can share a few hours of crayfishing with my nephews in the currently impaired Conococheague and paddling in the impaired Susquehanna without fear of dirty water.</p>

<p>My New Year&rsquo;s resolution is to continue pushing hard for clean water in Pennsylvania and share my favorite waterways with friends and family more often. What&rsquo;s yours?</p>

"Proxy Battles, Bad Omens, and Small Victories: A 2017 Policy Retrospective",12/18/2017,"<div>A war against environmental protection is being waged in Pennsylvania and 2017 was about positioning for the next round of legislative attacks.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Proxy battles were waged through negotiations on the state budget and a proposed severance tax on natural gas, signaling larger efforts to come in 2018. And the legislature continued its dismantling of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).</div>

<div></div>

<div>The callous legislative attacks on foundational clean air, water, and public lands policies continue and are unrelenting.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s important to not lose sight of the victories in 2017 that are having tangible impacts and will improve local air quality and boost renewable energy and energy efficiency in the Commonwealth.</strong> Certainly, defending our communities and ecologies from bad legislation is a top priority, but advancing good legislation has been critical to re-engaging the public and policy community to show what good environmental laws can do for people&rsquo;s health, jobs, and living space.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>In retrospect, the headlines below best summarize the state of environmental policy in 2017:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gutting basic protections against oil and gas industry pollution.</strong> A major proxy battle over oil and gas regulations was (and is still being) fought through the severance tax debate. The Senate and Governor agreed to a deal in the summer that would have levied a small severance tax in exchange for weakening the DEP&rsquo;s ability to enact strong permits for industrial activity. In particular, it would have shifted some of DEP&rsquo;s permitting authority to industry-chosen third-party reviewers, as well as forced DEP to approve all permits within a certain period of time, no matter if they&rsquo;re deficient. This bill died in the House, but momentum for gutting DEP permits still remains.</li>
	<li><strong>Allowing unlimited methane pollution.</strong> The Governor has made it a priority to implement the Commonwealth&rsquo;s first ever limits on methane pollution and the legislature is doing its best to stop that from happening. A provision to give the legislature the ability to veto any methane regulations was passed by the Senate and proposed in the House. DEP is advancing new methane limits on new oil and gas infrastructure as I write this blog, setting up a significant battle in 2018 over its success, as well as efforts to implement methane limits on existing oil and gas operations.</li>
	<li><strong>The continued dismantling of DEP. </strong>The FY2017-18 state budget was similar to the last decade in that DEP&rsquo;s budget was cut another 6 to 7 percent, depending on the line item. This adds to the 40 percent already cut in DEP&rsquo;s budget over the last ten years. This hollowing out is having tangible impact, as we see fewer inspectors who can ensure water supplies are safe, fewer inspections of oil and gas activity, fewer permit reviewers, and a smaller number of scientists studying new sources of pollution. For a state with a long history of environmental degradation, it&rsquo;s a stunning and underreported story with long-term consequences, and these shortages leave everyone at risk.</li>
	<li><strong>New subsidies for nuclear plants put on hold. </strong>Nuclear industry efforts for new subsidies benefitting its five Pennsylvania plants didn&rsquo;t gain traction with the legislature in 2017. Instead, the industry pushed the legislature to provide its toothless support for the Department of Energy&rsquo;s (DOE) request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to immediately provide support for aging coal and nuclear plants. Depending on what FERC ultimately does with DOE&rsquo;s request dictates whether the nuclear industry will apply significant pressure to get state subsidies in 2018.</li>
	<li><strong>Solar receives a legislative boost. </strong>Solar energy finally received support from Harrisburg. A provision in the state budget (Administrative Code, House Bill 118) includes language to &ldquo;close Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar borders.&rdquo; What this means is that utilities must source solar energy projects housed in Pennsylvania to meet the Commonwealth&rsquo;s solar target (0.5 percent by 2020), rather than being able to source outside of the state. Under previous law, utilities were sourcing more than 70 percent of its projects from outside the state, stealing jobs and projects from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar industry.</li>
	<li><strong>Commercial PACE builds momentum.</strong> Commercial PACE (C-PACE), which provides new financing mechanisms for municipalities wanting to support commercial buildings becoming more energy efficient, took steps forward in 2017. The bill is cosponsored by nearly 2/3 of the state Senate and is poised for passage in 2018.</li>
	<li><strong>Protecting the Delaware River Basin from fracking. </strong>The Delaware River Basin Commission took its next steps toward officially banning oil and gas drilling in the Delaware River basin. While much of this process will play out through 2018, it was an important step toward protecting the important headwaters of the Delaware and the ecology it supports. As it currently stands, the proposed regulations aren&rsquo;t perfect and would still allow fracking fluid to travel from and through the basin. As such, more work needs to be done on the regulations, but the ban on fracking is a major step toward protecting this important water resource for the state.</li>
</ul>

<div>Many of these issues and battles will continue well into 2018, leaving no rest for the weary. There are bad omens signaling further attacks in the near future, but public engagement, perseverance, good science, and strong advocacy are helping turn the tide and beat back, at least some, bad legislation.</div>

<div></div>

<div>I personally started 2017 much more cynically toward what was to come. It had been a bruising 2016 and environmental protection was poised for more rollbacks. But I end 2017 on a positive note. <strong>I see a re-energized environmental community and a general public catching on to the bad deals they&rsquo;re being dealt. </strong>Furthermore, I see pathways to advancing new protections and stopping the agents of greed and environmental destruction from succeeding in making Pennsylvania a wild west for industry and pollution.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Onward and upward.</div>

The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is Not for Sale,12/14/2017,"<p>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge spans over 19 million acres, a third of which is designated as pristine Alaskan wilderness and is a habitat for polar bears and dozens of other species. Hundreds of thousands of porcupine caribou, native to Alaska, migrate each year through the Coastal Plain. (1) The Arctic Refuge is an incredible example of America&rsquo;s natural legacy and is a symbol to the world that the United States has historically been one of the great stewards of the wilderness.</p>

<p><strong>However, that legacy may soon be tarnished by greed and profit.</strong> On Nov. 16, the House of Representatives passed the first version of the tax bill, which did not include anything regarding the Arctic Refuge. A week later, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) added a provision to the Senate version of the Tax Bill that essentially opens the Arctic Refuge&rsquo;s Coastal Plain to oil and gas drilling through an auction of lease sales.</p>

<p><strong>The resulting profit would cover only a fraction of the deficit that will result from the deep tax cuts that congressional leaders are proposing. </strong>The Coastal Plain is an ecological center for the wildlife that lives in the Arctic Refuge. Selling off these lands to oil and gas corporations to support tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans makes little economic sense and endangers a national treasure, which will never be able to be replaced once it is gone.</p>

<p>On Dec. 2, the Senate passed its version of the tax bill, which included Senator Murkowski&rsquo;s Arctic Refuge provision. In a process called &ldquo;Reconciliation,&rdquo; representatives from each congressional chamber have been tasked with reconciling differences between the House and Senate versions. Once complete, this compromise bill will return to the House of Representatives for a vote. Unfortunately, reports say that the Arctic Refuge provision will be included in the &ldquo;reconciled&rdquo; bill.</p>

<p>The Arctic Refuge has been imperiled before, but the decision to open the Coastal Plain is a deeply unpopular one. Environmental groups and conservationists across the country are critical of the tax bill, in part because of this provision.</p>

<p>Collin O&rsquo;Mara, President and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, of which PennFuture is a state affiliate, is one of those leaders who has worked to mobilize action on behalf of preserving this habitat for so many species of animals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drilling in the arctic will forever scar one of the remaining truly wild places on earth with a maze of well pads, roads, and pipelines. Destroying critical habitat for imperiled polar bears, porcupine caribou, and musk oxen, not for national security reasons, but for short-term tax breaks that benefit the few, is simply wrong. Some places are too special to drill. We urge members of Congress to defend the Arctic,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Mara said.</p>

<p>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a wildlife refuge first and foremost. It should remain fully protected for the many generations to come.</p>

Pittsburgh's Dirty Open Secret: Air Pollution,12/12/2017,"<p><em>Pictured: Greg Cooper and Colleen Sohn outside of their former home in Bellevue.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>By Colleen Sohn, Guest Blogger and Former Pittsburgh Resident</strong></em></p>

<p>Shortly after ringing in 2015, in the wee hours of the morning, I awoke to an acrid burning. In the moment of dread and terror before shaking my husband and hopping from bed, I thought: Weve only lived here a month and havent even unpacked all the boxes.</p>

<p>Lightning quick, we dashed around the house, upstairs and downstairs, finding no flame. My husband unearthed a flashlight, and champion that he is, ran outside, clad only in underpants. There, he realized it was neither the house, nor the garage, but the sky, our neighborhood cloaked in a cloud of toxic air.</p>

<p>We were born and raised in Colorado, and had spent the previous 16 years living in Portland, Oregon. It was not as though pollution was entirely foreign to us. Denvers brown cloud of our youth was an ugly brute that often kept kids inside and friends and relations from burning fires in winter. Wed caught dreadful whiffs of air from the paper plant located upriver from our home in Portland. Sadly, these were mere kittens to the beast we would experience in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>My husband and I consider ourselves to be adventurous and easy going. We love to travel, to experience new places. After spending the first half of our lives in the West, we decided it was time to better know the East. From all we read online, it seemed Pittsburgh was the place to do it. Like Portland, it is a river city, fancies itself &quot;green,&quot; and has a burgeoning restaurant scene. Theres great architecture, a gorgeous skyline, and world renowned institutions of learning. Its also a mere day-long (or less) drive from practically every city and town we hadnt yet had the opportunity to explore. Perfect on paper.</p>

<p>I arrived in October to buy a house. The skies were clear and bright and the winds were favorable. I never caught so much as a whiff of the air that would come to be my tormentor. I looked at houses in practically every neighborhood, too distracted by the task at hand to notice the chemical plants and factories along the rivers. I settled on a 1908 brick beauty in the borough of Bellevue. We could walk to the library, shops and restaurants, and zoot easily downtown. Again, perfect on paper.</p>

<p>Then, that fateful night, everything changed. At first, we thought it was a fluke. Then, we were taken aback, again and again, out to get groceries, visiting friends, a myriad of awful scents on the breeze. We asked around. &quot;I dont smell anything,&quot; they said. &quot;Its pollution from Ohio,&quot; they said. &quot;Its trains passing,&quot; they said. And then we saw it, Neville Island, and knew.</p>

<p>We learned about black carbon, part and parcel of PM2.5 - known to increase risks of lung cancer, asthma, and heart attacks, Pittsburghs dirty open secret. We also came to know what we called the Pittsburgh mantra: &quot;You should have seen it before. Its better than it was!&quot; We heard the &quot;hell with the lid off&quot; stories, the businessmen who changed their soot stained shirts at lunchtime stories. And so it was better, and yet so awful.</p>

<p>As our interests and circle of friends widened, we further explored the city, secretly hoping we would find that magic spot where the pollution would not find us and perhaps move there. We had fun evenings in Mount Lebanon, saw movies in Regent Square and Lawrenceville, ate burgers on the South Side Flats, perused the murals of dahn-tahn, walked in Frick and Schenley Parks, and were assaulted. We met friends at an outdoor classical music concert on the most gorgeous of summer days in Highland Park, spreading our blankets in the warmth of the sun, only to be assaulted, yet again. We complained amongst ourselves and were on the receiving end of the evil eye from surrounding concert-goers. How dare we speak the truth out loud.</p>

<p>We kept a calendar, rating the air from zero to four. Zero was a lucky day, one where we could walk the neighborhood, dash off to the Phipps or the cookie shop and not feel our nostrils burning. A four had our HEPA filter on full blast. Our calendar showed more one to four days than zeroes, a whole lot more.</p>

<p>And so it went, any time we questioned or saw anyone else question the polluted air, we heard the Pittsburgh mantra, it was blamed on Ohio, or were told, &quot;Hope the door kicks you on the way out.&quot; And so we left, just over a year after moving into our lovely home. Were back in the West, Colorado Springs. The air is some of the cleanest in the country, and each day we breathe a literal sigh of relief that we were among the lucky ones. We could leave.</p>

<p><em><strong>Colleen Sohn is a bit of a renaissance woman. A former teacher, she is a photographer, writer, gardener, and ace cook. Born and raised in the West, shes happy to be back in her home state of Colorado. She and her husband lived in Pittsburgh for one year, between 2014 and 2015.</strong></em></p>

Your Donation Keeps Eagles Safe in Their Nests,12/12/2017,"<p>PennFutures work to protect and sustain the natural habitats of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s wildlife is effective - and sometimes that hard work leads to other environmental benefits &ndash; like a new park!</p>

<p>A 600-acre woodland set high on a hilltop overlooking the Monongahela River in Pittsburgh, known as Hays Woods, has long had an amazing diversity of wildlife that called it home. So, when Hays Woods became a high-profile, proposed location for a strip mine intended to level its hills and fill its stream valleys to pave the way for a race track and casino, PennFuture&rsquo;s Vice President of Legal Affairs, George Jugovic, Jr., led the way to protect it.</p>

<p>PennFuture partnered with neighbors, grassroots organizations, activists, university students, and concerned decision makers to fight to protect the woodlands and streams for local wildlife. The work that began in 2003 culminated in a 2009 major legal victory for Hays Woods and Pittsburgh&rsquo;s environment.</p>

<p>Then in 2013, eagles began nesting in the forested hillsides of the property. Thirty years ago, there were only three nesting pairs of bald eagles in all of Pennsylvania. Today, more than 270 pairs nest in our state. Their recovery in Pennsylvania, and throughout the nation, is one of our great wildlife conservation stories. Habitats like that of Hays Woods are critical for their continued recovery.</p>

<p>And today, Hays Woods takes another step to being the newest park in Pittsburgh, something that would not be possible if not for the good work of PennFutures lawyers, which prevented mountain top mining on the Hays Woods site more than 14 years ago.</p>

<p>Our legal work is more critical than ever and <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2017dec/index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=fba1a123-4ab3-4243-b044-d50e8ac2c2ab&amp;eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=4173f0bf-87f6-4917-bf94-cd69ec19f3de""><strong>your tax-deductible gift to PennFuture </strong></a>is a powerful investment as we fight on your behalf to protect our parks, wildlife and special habitats for generations to come.</p>

How Pending Federal Appropriations Might Affect Chesapeake Bay Watershed,12/7/2017,"<p>As our federal government approaches Friday&rsquo;s deadline to avoid a government shutdown, we wanted to check-in on how pending federal appropriations proposals will affect the Susquehanna River Basin and larger Chesapeake Bay watershed in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The health of the Susquehanna River basin and the Chesapeake Bay watershed in Pennsylvania is something that PennFuture works hard to protect and fight for every day through policy, litigation, communications, and outreach. For the past several years, PennFuture has led the fight for listing the lower Susquehanna River as impaired after the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission found signs of sick aquatic life, advocating for increased conservation dollars for farmers, and cutting back on the overuse of fertilizer. Not only does PennFuture lead the Commonwealth&rsquo;s clean water advocacy efforts at the state level, but our constant presence and relationships forged with our federal legislative offices have forced the slow-down of regulatory roll-backs and the draconian gutting of critical funding for the Susquehanna River basin.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the White House released its 2018 federal budget proposal, which included massive cuts to investment in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Alarmingly, President Trump&rsquo;s proposal slashed the EPA&rsquo;s annual Chesapeake Bay Program budget from $73 million to $0. If the proposed budget had been enacted, it would have been impossible for Pennsylvania to meet its pollution reduction obligations required by the U.S. Clean Water Act to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and restore local streams in the Susquehanna River basin.</p>

<p>Chesapeake Bay Program funding for restoration comprises nearly 55 percentof its total budget. Under President Trump&rsquo;s proposal, Pennsylvania would have lost nearly $12 million in aid through Chesapeake Bay Implementation grants and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Stewardship grants. If the Bay Program&rsquo;s almost $41 million of on-the-ground grant funding disappeared, the state of Pennsylvania would be left without the resources necessary to guarantee clean water to local communities and businesses. At a time when there is broad-based support to work on pollution reduction compliance goals, this funding is crucial to support a wide range of watershed efforts, including agricultural best management practices for farmers, green infrastructure and stormwater management for municipalities, and protecting riparian buffers along streams.</p>

<p>Despite 63 percent of Americans having a favorable view of the EPA, under President Trump&rsquo;s proposal, the EPA&rsquo;s budget would take the hardest hit of any agency. Its 31 percent budget cut would eliminate more than 3,000 staff and discontinue a number of programs critical to the survival of America&rsquo;s wildlife.</p>

<p>Without full funding, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waters are put in jeopardy by nutrient pollution, erosion, sediment, and run-off. A healthy and robust Chesapeake Bay Program budget is an integral part of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s effort to ensure clean water for its citizens and the Susquehanna River basin.</p>

<p><u><strong>Fortunately, we can tell a different story.</strong></u></p>

<p>Through the spring, summer, and fall, PennFuture has been actively working with congressional offices across the state and in Washington to reinstall the EPA funding for the Chesapeake and Susquehanna. We learned in October that the House Interior Appropriations bill has approved returning $60 million to EPA&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Program, and just before Thanksgiving, we heard that the newly passed Senate Interior Appropriations bill has included $73 million for the Chesapeake Bay Program, with $6 million for each grant program ($12 million in total).</p>

<p>PennFuture extends deep thanks to our champions for Chesapeake funding in the House of Representatives for their work in seeing the Bay Program&rsquo;s budget secured and renewed &ndash; namely, Congressman Glenn Thompson, Congressman Charlie Dent, Congressman Lloyd Smucker, and Congressman Matt Cartwright. PennFuture thanks Senator Bob Casey, as well, for his continued support for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Chesapeake and Susquehanna funding.</p>

<p>Our pollution reduction goals for the Chesapeake Bay watershed cannot be realized without continuing to make these clean water investments in our communities. We are asking our federal legislators and President Trump to support funding for programs that provide aid to Pennsylvania, local governments and communities, and farmers throughout our region. A strong EPA is essential for the restoration and stewardship of the Susquehanna River basin. We ask our members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation to bring back full, dedicated funding for our clean water in upcoming appropriations legislation.</p>

<p>Anyone who spends time in the outdoors knows that Pennsylvania has abundant water resources. With more than 86,000 miles of streams, we&rsquo;re second only to Alaska. Unfortunately, there is a water crisis in Pennsylvania, and a united voice of citizens is needed to press back and remind our federal legislators that funding for clean water is non-negotiable. Six million Americans rely on the Susquehanna River for their drinking water, but that has been put at risk. Elected officials have failed to protect the water we drink by failing to protect our waters and streams, and as a result, Pennsylvania ranks third in most reported drinking water violations.</p>

<p>We have a constitutional responsibility to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and that includes protecting and maintaining our rivers and streams.</p>

<p>We must support a responsible budget and EPA&rsquo;s role in protecting the Susquehanna and the Bay. We must remind our Representative and Senators that we oppose President Trump&rsquo;s plan to slash the Chesapeake Bay Program budget and support the recent Senate bill to fully restore the $73 million for the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean water depends on it.</p>

November Snapshot: Chesapeake Bay Clean-Up Efforts,11/28/2017,"<p>It has been a busy autumn in terms of addressing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s water quality challenges.</p>

<p>Since the kick-off of the Steering Committee for the Watershed Implementation Plan&rsquo;s Phase III in early June and the large success of Penn State University&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ag Progress Days&rsquo; in August, stakeholders and voices for clean water across the Commonwealth have provided critical feedback and scores of public comments to the PA Department of Environmental Protection on how and what to address with the Chesapeake Bay clean-up.</p>

<p><strong>In late August, the Wolf administration rolled-out an announcement regarding the first year of the Chesapeake Bay Agricultural Inspections Program and wrote about how the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, in partnership with Pennsylvania&rsquo;s conservation districts, &ldquo;not only exceeded federal expectations for numbers of acres inspected, but also found that a majority of farms are complying with state planning requirements.&rdquo; </strong>The executive branch agencies working on the current Chesapeake Bay clean-up efforts should be lauded for their 60 percent farm inspection completion rate, but this means about 40 percent of the Keystone State&rsquo;s 60,000 farms have yet to be inspected. This means that more than three million acres of agriculture land has gone the last year without ascertaining whether these properties are compliant with conservation and maintenance requirements. With yet another shaky and delayed state budget this year &ndash; at times agriculture preservation and conservation dollars in jeopardy &ndash; these missed opportunities underscore the importance of increased staffing and funding in our state agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Through September and October, the WIP Steering Committee met regularly to start to answer the larger questions and establish the stage for the development of the Watershed Implementation Plan.</strong> Key workgroups on funding, agriculture, wastewater, stormwater, forestry, and local area goals, priorities, and practices have begun to meet in earnest. As Pennsylvania&rsquo;s WIP Steering Committee has begun to dig deeper to address current water quality challenges, a few members reflected on the experience of Phases I &amp; II. Chief among these reflections were that Pennsylvania policymakers, in Phase III, should break down the larger target numbers of the EPA expectations to a more local, and tangible level. It was also recommended that the third phase, helping Pennsylvania meet its TMDL pollution reduction goals by 2025, should ensure that the current local water cleanup efforts be accurately tracked and the data shared with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>

<p><strong>Perhaps the clearest proposal to keep in mind moving forward is the need to identify the value (economic, cultural, spiritual, aesthetic, etc.) and stacked benefits of cleaning up our local waters.</strong> In reports this fall presented at the Susquehanna River Symposium at Bucknell University, hosted by the Susquehanna River Heartland Coalition for Environmental Studies, the University of Michigan and Penn State University state that, when we monetize and think in terms of economic value of a natural resource, the Susquehanna River Basin is worth nearly $2 billion annually. Investing in our watershed should not be about the Bay, but instead about restoration and stewardship of our own waters. As an Amish farmer from Lancaster County told me this fall, &ldquo;Our conservation is not about meeting requirements &ndash; it&rsquo;s all about taking care of our home.&rdquo; The cost of inaction far outweighs the abundant benefits of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s renowned outdoor recreation, beverage industry, sustainable agriculture, energy, and forestry, and clean water supply.</p>

<p><strong>What remains to be clear is that Pennsylvania is far behind in meeting its pollution reduction goals for nitrogen, phosphorous, and sedimentation.</strong> Thanks to generous help and leadership provided by the University of Maryland, United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC), and the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program, Pennsylvania stakeholders, policymakers, and members of the WIP Steering Committee are starting to understand the way forward better. Large-scale and in-depth efforts are underway to collect and analyze data in order to create local water cleanup plans with the greatest possible impacts and it has become a priority of the groups at play to focus on the top load-producing watersheds.</p>

<p><strong>A newly released report entitled &ldquo;Boots on the Ground&rdquo; from the Chesapeake Bay Commission further points out the severe need for more technical assistance to farmers implementing best management practices in the Bay watershed &ndash; including Pennsylvania &ndash; along with increased need for incentives and funding.</strong> As 2017 begins to draw to a close, EPA Chesapeake Bay Program staff are starting to determine how Pennsylvania is doing and what actions must &ndash; and should &ndash; be taken to get the state on track again for 2025. The TMDL mid-point assessment does not look good for Pennsylvania, and that is before we think about other factors inhibiting progress that are knocking on our door: addressing climate change&rsquo;s effects on the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the Conowingo Dam issue, the potential impairment of the lower Susquehanna, pipeline infrastructure, and development and forest fragmentation taking place at rapid paces.</p>

<p><strong>And this all brings us back to the age-old problem in Penns Woods: funding.</strong> While the state budget dilemma for FY2017-18 has been resolved, albeit four months overdue, state dollars for conservation practices and staffing at our state agencies charged with clean water responsibilities seem to be cut on an annual basis. Members of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s General Assembly have dug in their heels on not investing in and prioritizing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean water and next year&rsquo;s budget process is likely to be slow coming, as well.</p>

<p>As this Watershed Implementation Plan process continues to unfold, make sure to take a stand for clean water. Follow our upcoming regular blogs on the WIP, frequent check-ins on the Bay watershed clean-up and upcoming policies we&rsquo;re pushing. Tell your state and federal legislators we need a strong DEP and EPA. This holiday season, #OptOutside - explore your watershed&rsquo;s headwaters and plant your holiday trees. Stay tuned.</p>

What You Need to Know in Advance of the Issuance of DRBC’s Fracking Regulations,11/27/2017,"<p>The Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) has directed its staff to issue regulations regarding unconventional natural gas extraction activities, namely, the horizontal, hydraulic fracturing method, also known as fracking,within the Delaware River watershed.Those draft regulations are to be issued no later than this Thursday, Nov.30.</p>

<p><strong>This blog post is intended to provide you with background information and to prepare you for the upcoming public commenting period.We want everyone to be engaged to protect the Delaware River from the environmental and human health risks posed by fracking.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Brief History of DRBC&rsquo;s Regulation of Fracking</strong><br />
<a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Moratorium-on-Fracking-in-the-Delaware-River-Basin-is-Critical-to-Protect-Our-Water"">We recently wrote about how the DRBC&rsquo;s long-standing moratorium on fracking is critical to protecting the Basin&rsquo;s resources.</a>In that blog, we briefly discussed why the DRBC was formed and what it does to protect the Delaware River.We also explained how the7-year &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; moratorium came to pass. We concluded by pointing out that DRBC had identified specific and serious concerns about the risk of harm posed by unconventional natural gas development in the Basin, and has held off on allowing such risky extraction unless and until it can ensure the protection of the water resources of Basin. Considering the precious nature of the Basin&rsquo;s resources, and the possible long-term impact that natural gas development can have on water resources, PennFuture supports a permanent ban on fracking in the Basin. </p>

<p><strong>What to Expect</strong><br />
The DRBC will draft regulations prohibiting the production of natural gas via fracking within the Basin, but will allow other fracking-related activities to occur within the watershed.In particular, the DRBC will allow both (1) the storage, treatment, disposal, and/or discharge of fracking wastewater within the Basin, and (2) the transfer of Delaware River water outside of the Basin for use in fracking.Both of these activities have the very real possibility of impacting both the water quality and water quantity of the Delaware River, andthese are the regulations that PennFuture is most concerned about.</p>

<p>When the draft regulations come out, we expect an in-depth review of the regulations regarding fracking wastewater and inter-basin water transfers will be needed.Based on our 2010 reviewof the then-draft DRBC regulations, we anticipate that the regulations will not be strong enough to sufficiently protect the critical headwaters and wetlands of the Delaware River.</p>

<p>At this point, it is unclear how long the public comment period will be, but PennFuture expects it to be at least several months, since DRBC has indicated its intent to hold several public hearings throughout the Basin.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do</strong><br />
As we review the draft regulations and the public comment process moves forward, PennFuture will be providing you with information and ways to get involved to protect the Delaware River Basin.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/donate"">please consider supporting PennFuture&rsquo;s efforts</a> to protect the sensitive, high-quality headwaters of the Delaware River Basin.</p>

Making a Difference with Momentum,11/27/2017,"<p>This month has turned out to be an extraordinary time for all of us who care deeply about our environment.</p>

<p><strong>We are beginning to see important shifts in power, both in the political realm and in the realm of our democracy in action.</strong> These shifts must become more pronounced, and must be sustained if we are to win back the safeguards that ensure cleaner air and water. The attempted theft of these hard-won laws, regulations and rights seems finally to be slowing. It is up to all of us to continue the fight, and hasten the shift back to a sane and balanced Commonwealth, where citizens can determine their clean energy future, assisted by responsible elected officials.</p>

<p>Thanks to the diligent and inspiring leadership of PennFuture&rsquo;s former director of policy, recently named Vice President and Chief of Staff Matt Stepp, along with Joanne Kilgour, director of the Pennsylvania Chapter of Sierra Club, and other groups active on the legislative front, we saw a near-disastrous state budget season turn net-positive.</p>

<p><strong>Not only was the environmental community able to fight off horrendous proposals to fundamentally change the state&rsquo;s approach to environmental permitting, and to stop raids on environmental funding, we had a win. </strong>We secured legislation to &ldquo;close the borders&rdquo; on solar credits. This means that solar energy that gets counted towards Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean energy goals must be generated within our state, somewhat incentivizing solar production right here at home. These measures were fought and won with the help of a cohesive and core group of pro-environmental legislators, who joined with PennFuture in taking a firm stand against the antis, holding that first line of defense, and perhaps for the first time, hanging tough as a core group to win the day.</p>

<p><strong>This month also saw diverse and pro-environmental candidates winning in the general election. </strong>A former Riverkeeper is now mayor of York. Every one of the candidates endorsed by our partner organization, Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, prevailed, and my colleague there, CVPA Executive Director Josh McNeil, is ready to bring more environmentally friendly candidates into the critical 2018 elections.</p>

<p><strong>In Western Pennsylvania, PennFuture&rsquo;s Toxic Neighbor campaign had material impact on holding to account the most egregious air polluter in the region &ndash; U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Clairton Coke Works.</strong>Recently joining me in speaking before the Allegheny County Health Department board and staff were a group of tenacious, smart and strategic community leaders who have been fighting for cleaner air in Pittsburgh for many years. Volunteer leaders with powerful messages are emerging through this campaign, including East End resident Lisa Minetti, <a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2017/11/12/Reality-check-Pittsburgh-s-air-is-still-highly-toxic/stories/201711120024"">who joined forces with PennFuture to write an op-ed that appeared in the Sunday edition of the Nov. 12th Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</a> Lisa&rsquo;s voice, our collective work, and this campaign is beginning to make a difference.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, <a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2017/11/14/US-Steel-Edgar-Thomson-mill-Pittsburgh-Braddock-on-notice-pollution-equipment-violations-EPA-ACHD/stories/201711140148"">we saw a glimpse of leadership</a> from the Allegheny County Health Department and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency when the agencies issued a notice of violation to U.S. Steel around another abomination in our right to clean air, the Edgar Thomson steel mill. <a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2017/11/19/Something-in-the-air-Violations-cannot-stand-at-local-U-S-Steel-plant/stories/201711300023"">And on Sunday, Nov. 19, we saw the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette state in an editorial that these continued air quality violations by U.S. Steel &ldquo;cannot stand.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Finally, emerging from the COP23 Climate Change Conference is a very important group of Pennsylvania mayors from Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Allentown, Ambler, Bethlehem, Easton, Ferguson Township, Lancaster, Swarthmore and West York Borough. These mayors have stated their commitment to support local climate action in the absence of federal and state leadership.</p>

<p>Is the tide truly turning? Do we have the collective will and energy to keep this momentum going? Can we beat back the next volley of anti-environmental measures that the legislature will surely try to put in place to protect the interest of the fossil fuel industry? Will more pro-environment leaders emerge in communities, to speak out, or stand for elected office? Will more climate-conscious mayors take their communities&rsquo; clean energy future into their own hands and stand with the Paris Climate Agreement? Will more elected officials join that core of pro-climate and pro-public health legislators and fight alongside PennFuture? The answer must be yes.</p>

<p>As I transition from running PennFuture, as its former Chief Operating Officer, to leading PennFuture as its president, I want you to know that I, and the rest of the staff, are privileged to lead the state&rsquo;s top watchdog for clean air, water and a healthy climate.Every day, we embrace our work, and the trust you have in us, with energy, passion and seriousness. We know you look to us for leadership, and turn to us for good information and assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Know that we look to you, too, for inspiration. </strong>You are making a difference with every vote you cast, every letter you write, every conversation you have with your family, friends or colleagues. With every check you write supporting PennFuture, with every solar panel you install, or light bulb you change out, and with your social media activism, you make a difference. So, keep up the good work, and I assure you that we at PennFuture will do the same. </p>

Environmental Impacts and the PennEast Pipeline,11/14/2017,"<p><em>PennFuture Staff Attorney Abigail M. Jones is pictured.</em></p>

<p>Last Thursday, a local Carbon County environmental organization hosted a press conference to bring to light concerns surrounding the anticipated approval of the PennEast pipeline.</p>

<p>Save Carbon County Coalition, along with PennFuture and the Lehigh Gap Nature Center, gave testimony on this issue at the Carbon County Courthouse Annex building in Jim Thorpe, PA after the commissioners meeting.</p>

<p>The group is anticipating that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), will give PennEast pipeline the certificate it needs to proceed with the pipeline construction following a meeting scheduled for Dec.21.</p>

<p>With this in mind, Save Carbon County President Linda Christman organized this press conference to highlight the environmental impacts that will follow pipeline construction. The impacts include clear cutting trees in Carbon County, treats to waterways and wildlife, along with eminent domain struggles for landowners. Save Carbon County will be holding frequent meetings with landowners to inform them of their rights at every step of the Eminent Domain process.</p>

<p>Lehigh Gap Nature Center&rsquo;s program specialists Chad Schwartz and Brian Birchak spoke about the clear cutting trees issues and how it will affect farmland, wetlands, and invite invasive species to inhabit the area. Clear cutting trees will create an edge for the regional/ native species that live in the area. This &ldquo;edging&rdquo; will offer space for invasive species, such as the spotted lantern fly and tree of heaven to take over the clear cut areas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While PennFuture has many concerns with the increased pipeline infrastructure in Pennsylvania &ndash; including climate change and cumulative environmental impacts &ndash; our focus is on the price that our environment and individual landowners are forced to pay as a result, even before the pipeline route is finalized,&rdquo; said Abigail M. Jones, PennFuture Staff Attorney. &ldquo;In our state, we are seeing an alarming lack of protection for the environment at the hands of the expansion of natural gas pipelines&hellip; it is estimated that Pennsylvania could have upwards of 10,000 miles of Marcellus Shale gas pipelines crisscrossing the state by the end of the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jones also highlighted: &ldquo;Our environmental rights are as fundamental as our right to free speech. Yet DEP&rsquo;s pipeline policy fails to protect our environmental rights from pipeline construction and &lsquo;pre-construction&rsquo; activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PennFuture, Save Carbon County, and Lehigh Gap Nature Center came together to educate the public and bring to light major concerns about the clear cutting process during preconstruction of the PennEast pipeline. This not only affects wildlife and nature, but the pipeline and tree clear cutting will affect the natural, scenic, historic, and aesthetic values to the environment throughout Carbon County and the rest of the PennEast pipeline routethat brings economically valued tourism and a beautiful place to live in the Lehigh Valley and beyond.</p>

<p>We love what we do at Goat Rodeo Farm and Dairy - raising our 100+ goats and making award-winning cheeses that people across Pennsylvania and the region love.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what you can accomplish in a few years. We have a beautiful, 130-acre farm located in a designated Agricultural Zone (AgZone) in Indiana Township, just 10 miles and a short 20-minute ride north of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p><strong>We worked hard to secure this designation. But today, Duquesne Light Company (DLC) is planning new construction of high-power transmission lines and monopoles for its northern region. Our AgZone falls within two routes under consideration.</strong></p>

<p>RESPECTAgZone is a community group of people who work and live in Indiana Township&rsquo;s Agricultural Zone. We&rsquo;re strongly opposed to Duquesne Light&rsquo;s routes that cross the AgZone because it will devastate our businesses, recreation areas and the environment.</p>

<p><strong>There is a viable alternate route that makes use of current rights of way and infrastructure corridors, and we&rsquo;re petitioning DLC to proceed with construction along this eastern route that follows the Pennsylvania Turnpike north to the West Deer area. It is an environmentally conscious route that will save small businesses like ours, recreation areas used by thousands, and 1,000 acres of agricultural land.</strong></p>

<p>The RESPECTAgZone community organization is doing everything possible to persuade DLC of the Pennsylvania Turnpike route. Turnpike engineers have told us they believe it is a viable, good route. And our state legislator and Turnpike officials are also supportive.</p>

<p>We welcome your support, too! Please visit <a href=""https://www.respectagzone.org/"">www.RespectAgZone.org</a> to learn more and sign our online petition to save this treasured farmland, a short 20-minute drive to the city. Also, we invite you to write to State Senator Randy Vulakovich and State Representative Frank Dermody to let them know this issue is important to you and it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. You can also copy Jessica Rock and Zach Merritt of Duquesne Light on your letters.</p>

Five Years After Superstorm Sandy,11/6/2017,"<p>On Tuesday, Oct.31, PennFuture commemorated the fifth anniversary of Superstorm Sandy by hosting a statewide telepresser exploring the relationship between climate change and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.</p>

<p>Larry J. Schweiger, President Emeritus, and Rob Altenburg, Director of the PennFuture Energy Center, discussed the climate impacts of governmental inaction as well as the enormous costs that taxpayers bear in the wake of increasingly severe weather events.</p>

<p>During the call, Schweiger addressed the combination of massive and widespread damage from this season&rsquo;s hurricanes, along with the California wildfires that were exacerbated by a warmer climate, and caused FEMA and other governmental emergency response groups to be strained financially and operationally.</p>

<p>Schweiger highlighted that over the past decade, the government has spent $350 billion responding to extreme weather and fire events, made worse by climate change, according to a <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/extreme-weather-climate-change-costing-taxpayers-billions-n813431"" target=""_blank"">recent report from the Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO). Additionally, as regulations are rolled back and our climate response is effectively halted, the cost of these storms will only increase.</p>

<p>Altenburg provided his expertise around environmental, climate, and energy policy that are essential to advancing clean energy solutions for Pennsylvania, and highlighted recent work in the state to improve our energy profile and move us towards a renewable future.</p>

<p>Altenburg also gave updates on the state of solar in PA and pointed to the Finding PA&rsquo;s Solar Future project as an ongoing effort by PennFuture to find a pathway to achieving 10 percent of our in-state generation from solar power by 2030.</p>

What It Means to Live Near Big Polluters,11/1/2017,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><img  src=""/Files/Admin/Blaine%2Dand%2DLisa%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 562px; height: 750px;"" /></p>

<p>We moved to Pittsburgh for many reasons: a slower pace of life, the kind of friends who will linger after dinner, and the chance to have a backyard garden.</p>

<p>Fifteen months into this Pittsburgh life, we have all of that and more. Unfortunately, there was one surprise that wasnt so welcome. Two days after landing here last July, we awoke to crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa, my wife, woke up with an asthma attack and a splitting headache. </strong>I woke up to the sound of her slamming the windows shut to our home in the East End. We hadnt yet unpacked the HEPA filter that we brought from New York. What was that smell? It was a blend of rotten eggs and burning metal. Whatever it was, we knew we had a big problem.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;The smell,&rdquo; as we have come to call it, is most noticeable early in the morning hours, and it is often weakened by noon. Beyond the nuisance of smelly air, this pollution gives Lisa respiratory distress and headaches. Exercising outdoors on a bad air morning is out of the question, and sometimes we have to cancel preplanned activities when bad air comes in.</strong></p>

<p>Our experiences led us to start investigating just what was producing this polluted air. Our search led us to the <a href=""http://www.achd.net/air/enforcement.html"">Allegheny County Health Department website</a>, which showed that there are four non-compliant industrial facilities in the county.</p>

<p>The smoking gun in our research was PennFutures investigation, finding 6,700 Clean Air Act violations by one of these facilities, Clairton Coke Works, in a 3.5 year period. During this period, Clairton Coke Works violations average to more than five air quality violations per day. </p>

<p>We know that the Allegheny County Health Department has repeatedly fined Clairton Coke Works for air quality violations. These fines have not stopped the violations or the resulting public health crisis. <strong>When a facility commits 6,700 air quality violations in 3.5 years, that suggests an operating strategy more than a series of accidents.</strong></p>

<p>PennFuture is a leader in the movement to help make sure our elected and appointed officials represent the environmental interests of the millions of people imperiled by industrial pollution in our community. <a href=""/ToxicNeighborPgh""><strong>We first noticed PennFutures Toxic Neighbor Campaign</strong></a> as a Facebook ad focused on the Clairton Coke Works. <strong>We were so inspired that the campaign was addressing the two most pressing local air quality issues &ndash; <a href=""/ToxicNeighborPgh"">the long emergency of the Clairton Coke Works</a> and the impending emergency of the <a href=""/toxicneighbor"">Shell Ethane Cracker Plant in Beaver County</a> &ndash; that we immediately sent a donation to help PennFuture amplify this campaign.</strong> PennFuture has been doing great work across the state for decades, and it is great to see them taking on some of our most significant environmental threats in Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Of course, the history of the coking and steel industry is one of flagrant local air pollution. <a href=""http://[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Donora_smog"">During the 1948 Donora Smog</a>, 20 people died as a result of U.S. Steels Hydrogen Fluoride and Sulfur Dioxide emissions, accumulating during a 4-day weather inversion. The disaster was partly limited by cooperation between local officials and plant managers who agreed that the plants had to be shut down for the duration of the weather inversion. Where is this kind of cooperation today?</p>

<p>Seventy years later, the air is cleaner in Pittsburgh than it was in the 1940s, but far from acceptable. In the 1940s, Mayor David Lawrence and banker Richard Mellon worked together to help check a smoke problem that was wildly out of control. Thanks in part to them, that coal door in my basement goes unused, and I dont have to change my shirt mid-day due to sooty air.</p>

<p>Today, we have the Clean Air Act and a better scientific and medical understanding of the health effects of emissions from coke and steel making. <strong>Unfortunately, we also have a situation in which industrial polluters can continue to pay fines to operate outside of Clean Air Act standards.</strong></p>

<p>The Allegheny County Health Department, ACHD Director Dr. Karen Hacker, and County Executive Rich Fitzgerald must lead us as David Lawrence and Richard Mellon did in the 1940s.They must act more aggressively to stop the toxic emissions that harm our most vulnerable populations, up to and including revoking emissions permits for non-compliant facilities. Until they do, Pittsburgh and Allegheny County will fall short of its potential to be a great, healthy place to live.</p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Leadership-Transition-Announced"">Last week, I became president and CEO</a> of PennFuture, a 20-year-old statewide organization fighting for your rights to clean air, pure water, and a healthy climate.</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d use this blog post to briefly introduce myself to you. I also want to personally thank everyone who supports PennFuture through activism or financial support. We will always need more of both, and I will strive to say thank you over and over again along the way, if I am lucky enough to meet you in person, and through these notes.</p>

<p>I hail from northeastern Pennsylvania, the anthracite coal region &ndash; Hazleton to be exact. I grew up surrounded by family &ndash; five of the seven houses on my block were occupied by my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins, and at one point, I could count more than 200 family members living in the Hazleton area. The view from our upstairs window was one of coal breakers, abandoned mineland, strip mines and even a steam shovel or two. Several of my uncles were active with the United Mine Workers and worked oiling the buckets at the end of the behemoth shovels&rsquo; arms. One of my uncles died tragically when ground underneath the steam shovel he was operating gave way. I was too young to absorb the breadth of this tragedy, which occurred around the same time that &ldquo;hard coal&rdquo; began to see its demise in the early 1960&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I left Hazleton the day after high school graduation to begin college at Penn State&rsquo;s main campus and soon began hiking, and doing a little birdwatching. That was the start of my real love of the outdoors and the wanderlust that has taken me to so many special parts of our state, the country, and beyond. After graduating from Penn State with a degree in English, I lived out west for a spell, working in Arizona and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where I ski bummed and became a river guide. After returning to my hometown, being outdoors and in nature as much as I could was a part of my essence as a person, and I spent a lot of my time around the Nescopeck Creek. The area&rsquo;s array of wildlife, natural communities and unique flora revealed itself to me in so many special experiences and observations over the many hours I spent there. I fell unabashedly in love with the place and could not believe I grew up so close to it, truly appreciating it all for the first time at the age of 26.</p>

<p><strong>My heart was broken when I learned that the state had plans to flood the valley of the Nescopeck, and condemn those gorgeous bottomland forests, wetlands, and miles upon miles of brook trout habitat to watery oblivion. I said to myself: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let them do it.&rdquo; And that was the day I became an activist, sometimes warrior, for our environment. I was able to build a large coalition of local, regional and national sportsmen and wildlife groups, supported by a list of state and national natural resource agencies with missions to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nature and biodiversity, and together, we stopped the dam at what is today Nescopeck State Park.</strong></p>

<p>In the early days of that fight, I met Larry Schweiger, who I now succeed as PennFuture&rsquo;s president. Larry offered me my first professional position in the environmental field, and I joined him at National Wildlife Federation&rsquo;s Washington D.C. office as he became head of its national field operation. Since then, Larry and I have worked together twice more over my 32 year career. We collaborated when he brought me into Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, and most recently at PennFuture, where I served as executive vice president and chief operating officer prior to my promotion to CEO. I am humbled to be taking the baton from himat this critical time for our planet.</p>

<p>In the coming months and years, I will have much more to share with you about this amazing organization, PennFuture, and the work of my gifted staff and volunteers. For now, let me fast-forward five decades from when I looked out the window of my home.</p>

<p>Today, when I peer out the window of my parents&rsquo; home in Hazleton, the mineland in the foreground of my view just this past year has been reclaimed, and the dangerous pits are filled in, graded, and covered with warm season grasses.</p>

<p>Now, I know that at the base of the next ridge over, Nescopeck Creek flows freely, and the next ridge further west of the Susquehanna River is making its way to Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>And while there is so much more work to be done &ndash; another part of the Nescopeck Creek receives the largest mine drainage on the east coast, and the Susquehanna River is being used to cool Talen Energy&rsquo;s Susquehanna Nuclear Power Plant -- let me tell you what lies on the furthest ridge out that I can see.</p>

<p>I see a long line of wind turbines, churning out renewable, clean energy: a symbol of our future, our children&rsquo;s future and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Future.</p>

Time for Solar,10/27/2017,"<p>On Saturday, Oct. 14, we joined a bus tour hosted by PennFuture and sponsored by Levin Furniture that featured three homes in the Pittsburgh area with solar power.</p>

<p>The first house was a solar passive house that made maximum efficient use of &quot;free&quot; energy from the sun.</p>

<p>The second house had a double array of 40 solar panels in the backyard of a homeowner who is driving an electric car (Nissan Leaf) and also has two electric Teslas ordered. He can fill-up at home for &quot;free!&quot;</p>

<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/bob1%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 750px; height: 422px;"" /></p>

<p>The third house featured 16 solar roof panels that provided about half their electric needs during most months of the year. Like the previous homeowners, they were very excited about their role in reducing air pollution and dependency on fossil fuels, while adding some energy independence to their own lives.</p>

<p>According to our tour guide, there is still time to save money on solar installations with a 30-percent federal tax credit extending through the end of 2019, while a reduced tax credit extends a year or two beyond that.</p>

<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/bob2%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 750px; height: 422px;"" /></p>

<p>Beyond the immediate benefits to the environment, homeowners estimate their investments will reach the financial break even point in 15 years.</p>

<p>Most of the panels have a 30-year guarantee and the average installation cost per roof panel is approximately $1,000 (before the 30% federal tax credit). Ground arrays cost more due the extra cost of posts and supports.</p>

<p>Imagine the beauty of lower electric bills while benefiting the environment, a win-win!</p>

Meet the Donor: Joseph Morinville – EIS Solar,10/27/2017,"<p>As PennFuture celebrated its 7th Annual Pittsburgh Solar Tour, which was held Oct. 14, I had the opportunity to speak with one of our long-time donors who has supported the event for several years &ndash; Joe Morinville of Energy independent Solutions (EIS Solar).</p>

<p>Joe is originally from Minnesota and came to Pittsburgh when he met and married a local lady! While he originally missed his hometown, he told me, &ldquo;Now you couldn&rsquo;t drag me out of here. I love Pittsburgh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked him why he started his business and what made him interested in renewable energy. Joe said there were two main events that turned him on to all things solar and renewable. The first was when he was a high school student back in Minnesota. His dad was interested in solar and Joe found himself taking a solar training course. He thought it was the coolest technology and really liked how it worked.</p>

<p>But in the early 2000&rsquo;s, the second event happened that really strengthened Joe&rsquo;s resolve. He and his wife were looking for some property to build a home in the Pittsburgh area and thought they had found the perfect place. But Joe noticed that the ponds on the beautiful property looked strange and sadly, he found out that the ponds were heavily contaminated. Doing some more research, Joe learned that the property had been owned by a coal company that had strip mined it and then went bankrupt. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection had been brought in to do a cleanup not once, but three times. Joe and his wife decided not to build their home there. Even today, Joe told me, the land is still vacant and unusable because of its legacy with chemical waste that remains in the water and surrounding ground.</p>

<p>All of that led Joe to really think about the impact and legacy of coal. It was not cheap, he thought. The cleanup costs and health impacts were enormous.</p>

<p>He then became involved in Oil Free Farms (O.F.F.), a nonprofit, before starting EIS in 2008. He had been in financial services for 11 years but was very interested in farming. He always liked agriculture and that combined with clean energy led him to the idea of farmers growing their own energy! He wanted to help farmers become more energy efficient and he began working with a team of folks on biomass projects.</p>

<p>One evening, he and his team were in a discussion group and a large general contractor came in and asked Joe&rsquo;s group to do an audit of their building. It turned out that the Massaro group wanted solar on their building, but as Joe said, at the time, he was not certified to do that. Rising to the challenge, Joe changed direction. He went from nonprofit to for-profit, got himself certified to do solar work, and EIS Solar was born! He&rsquo;s never looked back.</p>

<p>One of the projects he is very proud of&mdash;he calls it the quintessential project for EIS Solar &ndash; was at Phipps Conservatory. At the time, EIS Solar was small and many believed he and his team didn&rsquo;t have the capacity to complete the job. Joe would go to events and people would come up to him and say &ldquo;If you and your team can finish at Phipps&hellip;&rdquo; and he would always respond, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t fail.&rdquo; But Joe knew they had to prove themselves, and they did. They have also worked on Phase 2 and Phase 3 at Phipps Conservatory&rsquo;s Living Building.</p>

<p>EIS Solar has completed work on five Living Building projects. Those types of buildings are harder to do than regular LEED buildings in terms of code compliance because the building has to create all of its own energy and clean its own water.</p>

<p>Joe says what makes his renewable work so gratifying is: &ldquo;our people.&rdquo; EIS Solar has assembled a team of phenomenal individuals &ndash; local to Pittsburgh &ndash; whose quality and workmanship is fantastic. His team, he said with pride, is the secret to their success.</p>

<p>From a clean energy perspective, Joe reminded me, you never accomplish all of your goals, but EIS Solar is where they want to be at this point in time.</p>

<p>When I asked him about what he hoped for the future of clean energy, Joe said, &ldquo;EIS Solar is always pursuing the cutting edge of things and we make sure we can build the most beautiful functional projects.&rdquo; But he noted Harrisburg is all about policy &ndash; and all the policy and all the technology in the world do not make clean energy &ndash; you have to actually build it!</p>

<p>Joe, thank you and your team for your clean energy leadership and your support! We&rsquo;re glad you are standing with us.</p>

ACE Program Volunteers Engage Legislators on Environmental Issues,10/13/2017,"<p>After the 2017 presidential election, Brian Polilli knew he needed to get involved in the democratic process to make a difference on environmental issues &ndash; he just wasn&rsquo;t sure where to turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Post-election, I was pretty aggravated about the direction of the country and since then, we have seen a lot of environmental standards being relaxed. The global warming issue is something we can&rsquo;t continue to drag our feet on,&rdquo; Polilli said. &ldquo;I have always been concerned about these issues and the election motivated me to take a further look at what I could do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he found PennFuture&rsquo;s newly created Advocates for Conservation and the Environment (ACE) Program, he discovered an outlet and the guidance needed to take the first steps to meet with his elected officials. This program enables volunteers to voice their concerns about environmental issues directly to their elected representatives in their home district offices.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s ACE program organizes teams of volunteers to educate their state and federal legislators about conservation and environmental issues. ACE volunteers provide policy makers with an opportunity to learn from concerned citizens who live in their respective districts about environmental and public health issues that affect their communities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;ACE committees meet with Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, to advocate policy rather than to advance an ideological agenda,&rdquo; said Jay Andrews, Ph.D, PennFuture&rsquo;s Director of Outreach. &ldquo;Such pragmatism is not just for show; it is an effective way to realize tangible benefits for our members, for the public, and for the environment. ACE is about policy, not partisanship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Polilli, 39, of Phoenixville, Pa., is a scientist with Johnson &amp; Johnson. As an ACE volunteer, he recently participated in two meetings that engaged State Rep. Becky Corbin&rsquo;s (R-155) office, and State Sen. John Rafferty&rsquo;s (R-44) office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These meetings are valuable no matter what happens. When you show your elected officials that enough people are concerned, it matters,&rdquo; Polilli said. &ldquo;We are trying to educate them and I learn something more as well in terms of the process. It helps when you participate in conversations and have experience with your elected official, rather than just reading about them in an article.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PennFuture outreach staff worked with Brian and other volunteers prior to the meeting, providing talking points and information about key environmental issues in his district, including education on methane pollution, watershed protection, and policy proposals that advance energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Polilli&rsquo;s biggest takeaway from the program is that the process is not as daunting as others may think. He is also more aware than ever that regular citizens need to voice their concerns about the environment to their elected officials to make sure progress is made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just assume the right thing is going to get done,&rdquo; Polilli said. &ldquo;That is frequently not the case. If you really believe certain things should be done, complaining about it on Facebook doesn&rsquo;t do anything. This is an opportunity. It is far less intimidating in the moment than you might think. These are professional people who are pleasant to talk to. If you go in to have a conversation, they will listen. If you know a little bit of information and are reasonably engaged on an issue, it&rsquo;s easy enough to talk about it.&rdquo;</p>

Join PennFuture's 7th Annual Solar Tour!,10/10/2017,"<p>Ever wonder how solar energy works in a city as cloudy as Pittsburgh? And even if it does work, is it affordable?</p>

<p><strong>All of your solar-related questions can be answered this Saturday, Oct. 14 at <a href=""http://pghsolartour.org/"">PennFuture&rsquo;s Seventh Annual Pittsburgh Solar Tour</a>, sponsored by Levin Furniture.</strong></p>

<p>During this event, you will have the chance to meet home and business owners who went solar for various reasons throughout the Greater Pittsburgh Area. For instance, Fred went solar to help fight climate change, Bryan wanted to save money on his electric bills, and Marybeth wanted a stronger energy approach for her family.</p>

<p>Others on the tour went solar because their neighbor made the switch, which isn&rsquo;t an uncommon reason. In fact, two researchers at Yale and the University of Connecticut found the single most important factor driving people to go solar happened to be peer influence.</p>

<p>With the Pittsburgh Solar Tour&rsquo;s interactive online map, you can take a look to see if someone in your neighborhood went solar and get insight on how it works for their home. The Pittsburgh Solar Tour strives to make sure you have all of the resources available when making the decision to use clean energy from solar panels.</p>

<p>While homeowners will be able to talk about their perspective of what the process was like for them, and perhaps show you some recent energy bills, you will also have the opportunity to speak with various installers from companies including Energy Independent Solutions, Scalo Solar, and SolarCity. They will be able to explain and suggest if a solar loan or power-purchase agreement is a better fit for your needs.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s tour features: Phipps Conservatory, Homewood&rsquo;s Oasis Farm &amp; Fishery Bio Shelter, The Aquaponics Project at Repair the World, Levin Furniture&rsquo;s Wexford location, and the Telsa showroom in the North Hills of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Solar Tour doesn&rsquo;t just promote solar energy. As Adam Haas of Phipps Conservatory states in our video, &ldquo;Sustainability isn&rsquo;t a destination, it&rsquo;s a journey. There&rsquo;s always something else to improve.&rdquo; By featuring other sustainable facets such as aquaponics and geothermal energy on the tour, even folks who have already switched to using solar panels can learn about next steps to take in their clean energy journeys.</p>

<p><strong>There are many different venues a person can take to participate in this year&rsquo;s tour. You can:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Take a free bus ride from noon to 2 p.m. and/or from 2 to 4 p.m. from the Frick Environmental Center, led by solar experts.</li>
	<li>Join the guided 2 p.m. East End Bike Tour, led by Solarize Allegheny&rsquo;s Sharon Pillar. The tour will start at solar homeowner Fred Kraybill&rsquo;s house at 7211 Thomas Boulevard in Point Breeze and end at the East End Brewing Company.</li>
	<li>Download our free mobile app or use the online interactive map to do a self-guided tour</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Be sure to secure your spot and register at <a href=""http://pghsolartour.org"">pghsolartour.org</a>.</strong></p>

<p>This tour istimely as Environmental Protection Agency ChiefScott Pruitt recently announced,<a href=""http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/354594-epa-chief-id-do-away-with-wind-solar-tax-credits""> &ldquo;I would do away with these incentives that we give to wind and solar,&rdquo; </a>referring to solar&rsquo;s investment tax credit.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s critical that we create more incentives for people to go solar, including better tax credits, rebates, performance payments, and property/sales tax exemptions as, solar only powers 5 percent of Pennsylvania. By participating in the Pittsburgh Solar Tour, we hope you&rsquo;ll see the enthusiasm these home and business owners possess and how we can continue to solarize Pennsylvania.</p>

PennFuture Opposes Any Repeal of the Clean Water Rule,9/27/2017,"<p>Today, <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2017-09-27-PennFuture-Clean-Water-Rule-Repeal-Public-Comments-%28EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203%29.pdf""><strong>PennFuture submitted public comments </strong></a>urging the Trump Administration not to repeal the federal Clean Water Rule.Repealing the Clean Water Rule would threaten Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean water, outdoor economy, and safe drinking water for millions of citizens.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of the Clean Water Rule is its protection of the sensitive, smaller waters critical to safeguarding water quality and wildlife throughout Pennsylvania.Small headwater streams and wetlands provide the greatest connections between land and water, trapping and storing nutrients, providing critical habitat, storing floodwaters, contributing to drinking water supplies, and filtering out pollutants. These streams are essential to protect drinking water; in Pennsylvania 58% of the streams that provide water for surface water intakes that supply public drinking water are intermittent, ephemeral, or headwater streams.But just as importantly, headwater streams have biological, chemical, and hydrologic connections to downstream waters.Scientific studies repeatedly demonstrate that the health of downstream lakes, rivers, and estuaries are directly tied to the health of their smaller headwater streams and wetlands. Leaving these critical headwaters vulnerable to pollution puts the health of all of our rivers and the communities that depend upon them at risk.</p>

<p>Case in point: according to a recent analysis, repealing the Clean Water Rule would result in a loss of Clean Water Act protections to 55% of all stream miles in the Delaware River Watershed.These intermittent, ephemeral, and headwater streams in the Delaware River Watershed provide not only clean drinking water but are also spots for outdoor recreation and esthetic enjoyment of the natural environment. A repeal of the Clean Water Rule would put all of this at risk.</p>

<p>And although Pennsylvania has the Clean Streams Law, which protects the &ldquo;waters of the Commonwealth,&rdquo; this federal Clean Water Act jurisdictional issue can directly impact water quality protections in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>For example, Section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires that any federally-permitted project that may discharge into a &ldquo;navigable waterway&rdquo; (the definition of which includes &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo;) cannot proceed unless the state certifies that the discharge will not violate state water quality standards. Quite simply, should the federal government narrow the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States,&rdquo; smaller but ecologically important streams and wetlands, which likely suffer greater impacts from these projects than larger waters, will lose this protection under the Clean Water Act. An important aspect of the 401 Water Quality Certification process is that states may deny a certification or impose conditions as part of its certification to ensure that the applicant complies with any applicable state law. These conditions then become a part of the federal permit. If a project avoids the need for state certification because the federal government narrows the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States,&rdquo; the states lose this ability to protect their waters by either denying the certification and halting the project or imposing federally-enforceable conditions to ensure that the project will not harm state water resources.</p>

<p>Additionally, and as a very practical matter, this loss of clear protection at the federal level for these critical headwaters and wetlands could result in the future weakening of protections in Pennsylvania as well, especially where the state environmental regulatory agency is so underfunded and under-staffed. <br />
PennFuture&rsquo;s comments made clear that we will not accept any repeal of the Clean Water Act protections that keep our waters, our economy, and our communities healthy.<br />
Background</p>

<p>Promulgated in 2015, the Clean Water Rule clarified the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; under the federal Clean Water Act, and notably extended clean water protections for small, intermittent and ephemeral streams and wetlands that had a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; to traditionally navigable waters.</p>

<p>The 2009 United States Supreme Court split decision in Rapanos v. United States, 547 U.S. 715 (2006) (&ldquo;Rapanos&rdquo;) left regulators and the regulated community confused about which waters fell under the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s jurisdiction because a majority of the Supreme Court did not agree on a definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States.&rdquo; The Clean Water Rule sought to clarify this confusion by adopting a definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; that was consistent with Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy&rsquo;s opinion in Rapanos, which protected any waters that had a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; to navigable streams.</p>

<p>In adopting the Clean Water Rule, EPA engaged in an almost 7-month public comment period, met with over 400 stakeholders, and received over one million comments on the proposed rule, with over 87% of them in favor of the agencies&rsquo; proposal. More than 50,000 Pennsylvanians supported the Clean Water Rule, including business owners, local officials, farmers, and health professionals.</p>

<p>PennFuture strongly supported the Clean Water Rule because it not only protected the larger streams used directly for drinking water by millions of Pennsylvanians -- it also protected sensitive headwater streams and wetlands that makeup thousands of miles of streams in the Commonwealth.</p>

Meet the Donor: Dawn Gorsline,9/26/2017,"<p>When Dawn and Brian Gorsline purchased property in Fairfield Township, they were overjoyed.</p>

<p>In 1999, Dawn and Brian were looking for property that would allow them to build a home to raise a family in a healthy and safe environment - a place where they could conserve land, grow Christmas trees and watch generations of their family experience the beauty of nature at its fullest.</p>

<p>Their search led them to an area in Fairfield Township, Lycoming County, zoned Residential-Agriculture. Dawn had grown up in the area and her family still lived there. &ldquo;It was the perfect place with the best people living in it,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Little did she realize that several years after building her dream home, Dawn&rsquo;s desire to protect her family&rsquo;s way of life would involve her in a constitutional law case that would lead all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In 2013, a neighbor mentioned to Dawn that a company, Inflection Energy, was looking at locating a shale gas well pad near their homes, and that a township meeting had been scheduled.Dawn recalls the meeting. &ldquo;It was filled with angry people who had a lot of questions&quot; she said.It was at this meeting that she met one of PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team members, who, after studying the township&rsquo;s zoning ordinance, said, &ldquo;We have a case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because the township&rsquo;s ordinance did not expressly regulate oil and gas development, in order to allow shale gas development in its R-A district, the township had to find that use of the land for construction and operation of a well pad was &ldquo;similar to and compatible&rdquo; with other land uses expressly allowed in the district.Despite opposition from those most impacted by the well, the township&rsquo;s board of supervisors approved use of the land to construct and operate the well pad. Within 3,000 feet of the pad were 126 drinking wells. The owner of the property on which the well pad would be located lived in another township. PennFuture, representing the Gorslines and their neighbors, the Batkowskis, challenged the township&rsquo;s decision in Common Pleas Court.</p>

<p>Dawn and her neighbors quickly experienced the impacts associated with construction of a gas well pad in a residential neighborhood.Seismic &ldquo;thumper&rdquo; trucks showed up unexpectedly; strangers with chainsaws appeared in backyards without permission; helicopters hovered overhead and dropped cables across those same properties. It generally felt like life had gone from predictable to chaos in a few short months.</p>

<p>When Inflection began constructing a holding pond for the well pad despite the pending appeal, PennFutures legal team sprang into action and obtained an injunction to prevent further construction activities until the judge could rule on PennFuture&rsquo;s challenge.After deliberation, Judge Mark Lovvechio issued a decision in favor of the Gorslines and Batkowskis, reversing the township&rsquo;s conditional use application.Judge Lovvechio believed that Inflection had failed to show that the proposed land use was &ldquo;similar to and compatible with&quot; other land uses expressly allowed in the district.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, Inflection appealed its loss to the Commonwealth Court.After written and oral argument, a three-judge panel of the Court reversed the Common Pleas Court&rsquo;s decision.The opinion was extraordinary in that the Court held that an industrial land use that uses heavy machinery, large diesel engines, and involves the storage of highly flammable material, toxic waste and explosives, and generates waste characterized as industrial by the state of Pennsylvania, was &ldquo;similar to and compatible with&rdquo; other land uses expressly allowed in the R-A district, such as single family homes.The ruling effectively cut an exception in the zoning ordinance so wide that it would result in shale gas development being allowed everywhere, regardless of the nature of the zoning district.It was an outrageous demonstration of judicial overreach.</p>

<p><strong>Not giving up, PennFuture sought allocator permission to have the case reviewed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Only a small percentage of these types of petitions are granted by the Court, but this one of them.The case presents for decision the issues of whether shale gas development constitutes an industrial land use, and whether the government violates the constitutional rights of existing property owners who relied on the township&rsquo;s zoning scheme by allowing incompatible land uses in the zoning district in which the residents reside.The case was argued on March 8, 2017.The case has the potential to establish statewide precedent on a number of important environmental and public health issues facing Pennsylvania.</strong></p>

<p>Dawn feels strongly that clean air and clean water should never be threatened and that we - all of us - need to fight for our basic rights to protect those natural resources and public health and safety. Dawn teaches third grade and environmental science at her primary school and regularly emphasizes to her students that &ldquo;wherever you step, there is life where you walk. You cannot just abuse the land and expect good results.&quot;</p>

Environmental Rights Amendment Forum Sparks Timely Conversation,9/25/2017,"<p>Nearly 200 citizens gathered on Sept. 14 at WHYY Studios in Philadelphia for PennFuture&rsquo;s &ldquo;Environmental Rights Amendment Forum.&rdquo; Attendees heard from legal experts, legislators, and current and former state officials who shared their perspectives on Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, an often-misunderstood provision commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Environmental Rights Amendment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Article I, Section 27 states: &ldquo;The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvanias public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the course of the evening, Forum panelists stimulated thoughtful dialogue about what&rsquo;s at stake for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s citizens and illuminated for a general public audience what had been, for many that attended, an obscure legal issue. Forum panelists reflected on the historical context in which the Amendment emerged, explained relevant case law, discussed needed enforcement, and considered the future implications of the Amendment for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s citizens and environment.</p>

<p>The evening began with Franklin Kury, the former state legislator who conceived the Amendment in 1969 and helped shepherd it through enactment in 1971. Noting that the Amendment was a bi-partisan response to the environmental degradation scarring Pennsylvania as a result of unregulated industry, Kury expressed great satisfaction that, 46 years after enactment, the State Supreme Court, in its monumental PEDF decision this summer, finally read the plain language of the Amendment as originally intended, reinvigorating Article I, Section 27.</p>

<p>Next, John Dernbach, Professor of Environmental Law and Sustainability at Widener University, walked the audience through the text of the amendment. In a concise yet engaging PowerPoint presentation, Professor Dernbach explained the nuances of each of the Amendment&rsquo;s three sentences, and how courts have construed them since 1971, culminating in the recent PEDF decision.</p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-How-the-Environmental-Rights-Amendment-Strengthens-Our-Impact""><strong>A panel of expert environmental attorneys then discussed the meaning and substance of Amendment case law since 1971</strong></a>, such as Payne v. Kassab, Robinson Township v. Commonwealth, and Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Fund v. Commonwealth. The panel focused on why PEDF is so significant, explaining that the Court has now said that the state does not own our public natural resources as a proprietor, but instead manages them as would a bank that manages funds in a trust.</p>

<p>Both the history and legal panels provided an ideal segue for a bi-partisan panel of state legislators, who considered the Court&rsquo;s assertion that the state has an &ldquo;affirmative obligation&rdquo; to prohibit the degradation, diminution, and depletion of public natural resources in Pennsylvania. Specifically, they addressed the Court&rsquo;s assertion that the state must act via the legislature to protect the environment as well as why so many legislators, despite the PEDF decision, remain reluctant to do.</p>

<p>Finally, John Childe, the attorney in the PEDF case, and John Quigley, former Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Secretary, provided thoughtful insights about where we go from here. They asserted that, in the wake of PEDF, a new era of environmental legal victories may be near. To be sure, they, like all of the evening&rsquo;s panelists, elevated the conversation about a complex topic with a clarity and gravitas too often missing in public discussions about conservation and the environment.</p>

Update: Finding PA's Solar Future Project Moves Forward,9/19/2017,"<p>The<a href=""http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/SolarFuture/Pages/Finding-Pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-Solar-Future.aspx""><strong> Finding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future project</strong></a> is a collaborative effort between the U.S. Department of Energy and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. PennFuture is working closely with project partners and stakeholders to find a pathway to achieving 10 percent of our in-state generation from solar power by 2030.</p>

<p>On Sept. 14, we held our third stakeholder meeting at the Inn at Villanova in Radnor, PA. Among the 81 people who attend in person and 25 who participated through a webcast, we had representatives from the solar industry, electric utilities, government, academia, nonprofit groups, and consumers.</p>

<p>This meeting represented a transition. Our first two meetings put a lot of emphasis on the details of our scenario modeling and our projections for what markets will look like in the future. This session focused more on specific issues that were identified as &ldquo;pivotal factors&rdquo; for achieving 10 percent in-state solar generation by 2030.</p>

<p>Prior to this meeting, we held a webinar on alternative ratemaking where Karl Rabago, the  Executive Director of Pace Energy and Climate Center; Eric Miller of the Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance; and Alan Cohn, Manager of Regulatory Strategy, at PECO discussed how different options for the rates we pay to electric utilities can impact the deployment of new technologies like solar.</p>

<p>At the in-person meeting, we had a panel discussion between Ethan Case of Cypress Creek Renewables and John McCawley of PECO Energy. This started the conversation on how solar generation will be split between large utility-scale installations and smaller distributed installations like rooftop solar systems. </p>

<p>While larger systems will continue to benefit from economies of scale and have lower installation costs in terms of dollars-per-watt, smaller distributed systems can still be cost-effective for consumers, are less subject to transmission losses, can help alleviate congestion, and can provide other benefits. </p>

<p>We also heard from our Keynote Speaker, Ken Schyuler of PJM, the Valley Forge based company that manages the electric grid for 13 states throughout the Midwest and mid-Atlantic and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>As we move forward on our project, it will be critical that our pathways to increased solar generation consider the needs and the abilities of our power grid to provide reliable electricity throughout the region.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not too late to be part of the discussion.

How Can You Protect Lake Erie?,9/19/2017,"<p>On Saturday, Sept. 9, Erie residents gathered at Perry Monument Pavilion at Presque Isle State Park to discuss how to save a beloved body of water: Lake Erie.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s Save Our Lake Erie event included everyone from Erie natives to young professionals who just moved to the area. The crowd was eager to learn about the environmental factors contributing to the degradation of Lake Erie and what they could do to alleviate these problems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lake Erie used to be the fishing capital in the United States, and now we&rsquo;ve found some fish species are endangered. Not only is Lake Erie a place for us to recreate, it&rsquo;s a place for us to protect. We must ask our state representatives to protect it for future generations,&rdquo; said Save Our Native Species (S.O.N.S.) of Lake Erie Fishing Club President, Jerry Skrypzak.</p>

<p>Several speakers addressed the crowd, including Jerry and myself, who spoke about an array of issues that need local, state, and national attention.</p>

<p>We learned that bad policies such as the Renewable Fuel Standard needs reforming to decrease the amount of ethanol used in gasoline, which would decrease the phosphorous used in corn production, and therefore decrease the agricultural runoff into Lake Erie causing the toxic, green algal blooms.</p>

<p>We also learned from Steve Porter of NW Page that climate change is increasing the temperatures of our bodies of water, including Lake Erie, which makes it easier for these algal blooms to stay in the water even longer, exacerbating this environmental problem, hurting our drinking water and potentially harming thousands of marine life.</p>

<p>Lastly, Anna McCartney of the Pennsylvania Sea Grant spoke about the harmful effects that microbeads have on the fish within Lake Erie. Scientists have proven that toxic chemicals such as PAHs and PCBs can damage DNA and cause neurological damage in aquatic animals. With the use of microbeads in personal care products becoming more popular, it&rsquo;s more than likely that they will make its way into Lake Erie.</p>

<p>All of this can be extremely overwhelming for one person to digest. How can one person begin to tackle all of these issues that need collective action? I decided to break it down to an action list by issue:</p>

<p><strong>Reforming the Renewable Fuel Standard:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>PennFuture will meet with Senators Casey and Toomey&rsquo;s Erie office to talk about ways to reform this legislation. You can email me at <a href=""mailto:regan@pennfuture.org"">regan@pennfuture.org</a> if you&rsquo;re interested in attending!</li>
	<li>We are looking for individuals to submit letters to the editor about this issue to educate the public. <a href=""http://customerservice.goerie.com/service-by-department/comments-feedback-letters-to-the-editor/"">Consider writing a letter to your local paper!</a></li>

Be a Watershed Watchdog with New Pocket Guide,9/5/2017,"<div>Imagine yourself in this scenario: you&rsquo;re walking along a trail in your favorite park when you approach a creek. You decide to walk closer to the bank to admire the fish, insects, and plants surrounding the area when you notice that something doesn&rsquo;t seem right.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Instead of the cold clear water that you usually see in the creek, you notice the water is cloudy and that there is more sediment and small rocks along the riverbed than usual. When you walk further down the creek, you notice a few fish floating by the bank. Feeling increasingly concerned, you look around to see if there are any other hikers along the path to consult with or for an information kiosk to see if there is a nearby environmental center, but find neither. <strong>Would you know what to do?</strong></div>

<div></div>

<div>PennFuture has a brand new resource to help you know what to do. The <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/FINAL-BE-A-WATERSHED-WATCHDOG-PDF.PDF""><strong>&ldquo;Be a Watershed Watchdog&rdquo; pocket guide</strong></a> is a portable, waterproof wallet-sized guide that helps you to identify pollution in your waterways and directs you on what you can do.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Pennsylvania has more than 86,000 miles of streams and rivers in the state, 19,900 of which are listed as impaired in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s (PA DEP) <a href=""http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/CleanWater/WaterQuality/Integrated%20Water%20Quality%20Report-2016/Pages/default.aspx""><strong>2016 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report.</strong></a> With the United States Environmental Protection Agencies&rsquo; efforts to <a href=""/News-PennFuture-Statement-Trump-Rescinds-Clean-Water-Rule""><strong>repeal the Clean Water Rule</strong></a> and the PA DEP <a href=""/News-State-Spending-Bill-Poses-Threat-to-Environment-Conservation-and-Public-Health""><strong>lacking the capacity and funding</strong></a> to adequately monitor water quality standards, we need all hands on deck to support and protect our waterways.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The &ldquo;Be a Watershed Watchdog&rdquo; pocket guide is the perfect tool for outdoor enthusiasts, sportsmen, students, citizen scientists, and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nature lovers. We all have a shared responsibility to be stewards for our environment, and knowing what to do and who to contact upon discovering pollution or an illegal discharge in a local creek or waterway is a critical first step.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The guide identifies six easily identifiable signs of potential pollution to look for:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Water discoloration,</li>
	<li>Unusual odors,</li>
	<li>Dumping,</li>
	<li>Fish kills, and</li>
	<li>Algal blooms.</li>
</ul>

<div>If you see one or more of these signs of potential pollution, you should take photos and/or videos, look for a potential source of the pollution, record your location, the time(s) of discovery, and your observations. These details can then be reported to the PA DEP, your <a href=""https://pacd.org/?page_id=59""><strong>County Conservation District</strong></a>, and to PennFuture.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Our waterways are the common property of all Pennsylvanians. Together, we can help to stop pollution as we see it and protect our waterways for the benefit of our communities and generations to come.</div>

Meet the Donor: Carl Balis,8/28/2017,"<p>Carl Balis, longtime supporter of PennFuture, was actually born in Japan while his father was stationed overseas. But he said he has no real memory of his time in that country, since his parents moved back to Philadelphia and Germantown while he was still an infant. These days, Carl calls Delaware County his home, and says that in his heart, he knows he fully became aware of environmental issues as soon as he could really look around.</p>

<p>&quot;If your eyes are open, it does kind of hit you in the face,&rdquo; he said. As world events and local issues affecting the environment kept rising to the forefront, Carl also noticed that there were huge changes to the beautiful open spaces near his hometown in Delaware County. So much of what he remembered as a young person was gone, swept up by developers. As he got older, he felt there was constant destruction and construction with no thought for the environment.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when he asked himself what he could do to make a difference. Carl realized that funding is a big factor to preserving land, and thats when he decided to start contributing to a variety of environmental groups, including PennFuture. Carl chose to donate to PennFuture because of the organization&rsquo;s local angle. He believes that the entire environmental movement is made up of a series of little accomplishments and victories, and he thought about how he could make a bigger impact locally. </p>

<p>Here in Pennsylvania, he has a personal stake in the issues, and he can affect change by supporting PennFuture. &ldquo;I wanted to take care of environmental issues in my own backyard where you can really put your hands on things, including calling local representatives and going to meetings,&rdquo; Carl said.</p>

<p>He was delighted to hear about PennFutures alliance with the Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, because that will have more of an impact on our work to protect public health and the environment. When I asked him what he would say to people to encourage them to support protecting the environment, he was very clear. &quot;You live in it. The people you love live in it. You are in it from the day you are born. If the environment goes down, you go down with it. It is your home. You need to get involved, contribute funds and vote! You can make a difference,&rdquo; Carl said.</p>

<p>He is very concerned with the loss of open spaces in our state. He asked, &quot;Why would you put poison in the water and air and annihilate the beautiful open spaces with development?&rdquo; Hes not against development, but feels there has to be better planning when encroaching on public lands. &quot;Once they begin developing, they dont spare anything until every square inch is taken. That is what happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carl also said he is disgusted by the Pennsylvania legislators inability to implement a true extraction tax for our state. He feels that tax is something people can relate to -- but by not getting this tax passed, &ldquo;the legislature is effectively letting big companies pay less, so we, the taxpayers, pay more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lastly, he is looking forward to attending our <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/91417environmentalrightsamendmentforum/index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=bb401717-4b11-495d-95cb-b5c040754d73""><strong>Environmental Rights Amendment Forum on Sept. 14</strong></a>, particularly because the recent June decision by the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court finally puts &quot;some teeth&quot; to the state constitutional provision. </p>

Experience the Aquaponics Project at Pittsburgh Solar Tour,8/28/2017,"<p><em>The Aquaponics Farm is a stop on PennFutures upcoming Pittsburgh Solar Tour, which will be held Saturday, Oct. 14. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2017solartour/index.html"">Click here for more information and we look forward to seeing you there!</a></em></p>

<p>Aquaponics is a sustainable agricultural practice built upon naturally occurring relationships. This system relies on the built-in checks and balances within ecosystems, allowing for optimal production while maintaining suitable living conditions for the entire ecological community.Aquaponics harnesses these incredibly powerful biological processes and marries them to cutting edge technology to create a controlled, profitable, and entirely sustainable system of food production.</p>

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>

<p>Two years ago, a small group of students from the University of Pittsburgh, myself included, formed The Aquaponics Project. <strong>Our objective was to build Pittsburgh&rsquo;s first portable aquaponics farm.</strong> We recognized Pittsburgh&rsquo;s status as a food desert, defined by a shortage of supermarkets and other stores that carry affordable healthful food, as well as many issues with traditional farming practices. We were able to find a solution to both problems in aquaponics.</p>

<p>Aquaponics allows us to grow plants and fish within the same system and capitalize on the symbiotic relationship between the two. The plants are grown in water alone; all nutrients the plants require are provided by the fish waste and, in turn, the plant roots purify the water, creating a healthy aquatic environment. It is a closed loop system in which every bit of energy is conserved and put to use. The only input is fish food, and the output is a lofty 600 pounds of vitamin-rich greens and protein packed fish per month with no waste, no pollutants, and no large footprint on the community.</p>

<p><strong>With this practice, soil is unnecessary, allowing for a more efficient use of space. This can save acres of forests, meadows, and wetlands from destruction for the purpose of being converted into farmland.</strong></p>

<p>Our team was able to come up with a design which recycles old shipping containers and uses them as the base for our greenhouses. The bottom level contains a 300 gallon tank of fish and the top holds about 35 vertical grow towers capable of producing 700 plants. The entire container only takes up 20&rsquo; x 8&rsquo;, allowing it to be placed in practically any community in need of fresh produce without creating a disturbance to the land or property values. It is also compact enough to be moved from location to location as an educational tool.</p>

<p>Our greenhouse has already made an appearance in Downtown Pittsburgh by the Gateway T Station and Manchester Park in the North Side. Next, we will be partnering with Repair the World and 412 Food Rescue to tackle food insecurity issuesin East Liberty.</p>

<p><strong>Embracing Modern Technology</strong></p>

<p>Every technological advancement we make to our design is meant to optimize yield, efficiency, and ease of use. Yet, increasing productivity does not have to mean increasing one&rsquo;s carbon footprint. In order to optimize our production, we have put into place a number of monitoring systems to collect data on PH levels, temperature, and growth. Additionally, as with all decisions we make regarding this project, we draw inspiration from natural processes. In order to support our electrical needs, we installed solar panels on the roof of our structure. We simply took note of what the plants in our greenhouse had been doing since the beginning of life itself; converting light waves into energy.</p>

<p>The sun is an inexhaustible source of energy that has been largely untapped. With the invention of photovoltaic cells and the recent decrease in production cost, harnessing the power of the sun has never been more accessible. Along with promoting healthy food choices, buying local, and eliminating food waste, The Aquaponics Project is proud to support the solar movement in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><strong>If you have yet to take a tour of our facility, we are excited to be a stop onPennFuture&rsquo;s Solar Tour this Oct.14, so drop by!

<p>PennFuture members have inquired why the state Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in Robinson Township v. Commonwealth did not result in an immediate change in how state and local governments make decisions.When issued, the Robinson case seemed to breathe new life into Article I, Section 27 of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Constitution (the Environmental Rights Amendment or ERA). Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion, in particular, was widely quoted and frequently praised by those in the conservation community, but it seemed to be largely ignored by lower courts and government agencies.</p>

<p><strong>To understand the reason for the differing responses, this blog explains the concept of &ldquo;legal precedent&rdquo; and how it took four years and another Supreme Court decision to transform Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion from a learned treatise into binding Pennsylvania law.</strong></p>

<p>In 2013, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in Robinson provided hope that, for the first time since the ERA&rsquo;s ratification in 1971, the judiciary would play a critical role in ensuring protection of citizens&rsquo; environmental rights. Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion, which exhaustively reviewed the history of environmental degradation that led to the adoption of the ERA, sought to establish a framework that recognized the fundamental nature of citizens&rsquo; environmental rights, and imposed conservation obligations on the government&rsquo;s management of public natural resources. The opinion seemed to many a siren&rsquo;s song for vigorous protection of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s natural resources. But that did not turn out to be the case - at least not immediately.</p>

<p>Legal precedent is a fundamental principle of the American legal system. It means that a ruling in a particular case, under certain circumstances, controls a subsequent decision in another case involving similar facts and issues. One of the circumstances is that a majority of the judges of the court agree on the rationale for deciding the case. If that happens, that majority decision controls how subsequent cases with similar facts and issues are decided, thus increasing its impact.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, a majority of the court agrees on the outcome of the case, but not on the reason for the decision. When that happens, those in the majority will write multiple opinions explaining their decision. The opinion that gets the most judges, but short of a majority, is referred to as the plurality opinion.Unlike majority opinions, plurality opinions are not binding on subsequent courts.</p>

<p>Such was the case with the Robinson decision. Four of seven justices voted to overturn parts of the Oil and Gas Act, but only three justices agreed that the provisions should be overturned because they violated the ERA. The fourth justice in the majority agreed that the provisions were unconstitutional, but he preferred to rely on a constitutional principle known as substantive due process. Because Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion was issued on behalf of three of seven justices, the opinion did not result in &ldquo;precedent&rdquo; that required future courts to interpret the ERA in the same manner.</p>

<p><strong>More than 40 years before Robinson, the Commonwealth Court, in a case known as Payne v. Kassab, explained how it would decide whether a government action violated citizens&rsquo; rights under the ERA.</strong>The court held that a court could not overturn a government action unless it determined that the action violated a statute or regulation, failed to incorporate reasonable efforts to reduce environmental harm, or caused environmental harm that clearly outweighed the benefits of the action. <strong>This three-part test, known as the Payne test, was exceedingly deferential to the legislative and executive branches of government. </strong>Unless the government acted in some patently egregious manner, courts would not find that citizens&rsquo; rights under the ERA had been violated. Not surprisingly, in more than 40 years since the adoption of the Payne test, Pennsylvania courts had not struck down a single government action as violating the ERA. </p>

<p>Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion in Robinson excoriated the Payne test, declaring that it was made from whole cloth and did not adequately protect citizens fundamental constitutional rights. Chief Justice Castille favored an approach that featured courts more prominently in protecting citizens&rsquo; environmental rights, just as if they were being asked to protect other fundamental rights such as the right to vote, or free speech. The courts, Chief Justice Castille said, should focus their evaluation on the reason for the government action and the extent to which citizens&rsquo; rights to &ldquo;clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment&rdquo; have been impaired.</p>

<p><strong>Following Robinson, PennFuture and other organizations argued in a variety of cases that, because of its sheer persuasiveness, courts should adopt the reasoning in Robinson. </strong>Our opponents, however, argued that Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion was not binding on the courts, which should reject Robinson in favor of continuing to use the Payne test. The lower courts, as well as government agencies - sided with our opponents - no matter how sound the reasoning, Robinson&rsquo;s plurality opinion was not binding in subsequent cases. </p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-State-Supreme-Court-Rules-Leasing-Public-Land-for-Fracking-Betrayed-Governments-Constitutional-Duties""><strong>All of that changed on June 20, 2017, when the state Supreme Court issued its decision in Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Fund v. Commonwealth.</strong></a> The Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Fund (PEDF), a nonprofit organization, challenged the constitutionality of a series of state laws that changed how revenue from the lease of oil and gas rights on public lands was being used. The revenue had previously been used solely to support conservation efforts associated with the public lands. The legislation changed that by transferring those funds to the general fund, where it would be used to support a wide variety of public purposes.</p>

<p>The ERA provides that the Commonwealth holds our public natural resources in trust for the benefit of all people, including future generations.PEDF argued that any revenue derived from the disposition of those public natural resources must remain a part of the trust and be used to further the purposes of the trust. <strong>The Supreme Court agreed, holding that funds derived from the lease of oil and gas rights on public lands must remain a part of the trust and be used to further the public&rsquo;s right to &ldquo;clean air, pure water and the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.&rdquo;</strong> The state, the Court said, does not own our public natural resources as a proprietor, but instead manages them as would a bank that manages funds in a trust.</p>

<p><strong>The Court&rsquo;s decision was monumental, but equally so was the Court&rsquo;s rationale.</strong> Unlike Robinson, a clear majority agreed that the laws violated the ERA.In making that decision, the Court squarely rejected the continued use of the Payne test, and just as squarely adopted, instead, the rationale described by Chief Justice Castille in Robinson.</p>

<p>Justice Baer acknowledged the change in direction embarked on by the Court: &ldquo;Through today&rsquo;s decision, this Court takes several monumental steps in the development of the Environmental Rights Amendment &hellip; [including] dismantling of the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s Payne test &hellip; [and] solidify[ing] the jurisprudential sea-change begun by Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s plurality in Robinson Township v. Commonwealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>So it came to be that, four years after Robinson, the state Supreme Court converted Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s plurality opinion from an eloquent essay on the meaning of the ERA into binding legal precedent in Pennsylvania.</strong></p>

Farmers & Clean Water Need State Lawmaker Leadership on Funding Priorities,8/17/2017,"<p><em><strong>This blog post is <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-We-Are-All-the-Watershed-Ag-Days-in-Happy-Valley"">one in a series</a> from Ag Progress Days, an eventhosted by Penn State University&rsquo;s College of Agriculture Sciences.</strong></em></p>

<p>Wednesday at Penn State&rsquo;s Ag Progress Days brought state and federal policymakers to Centre County. The show&rsquo;s site was busy with farmers and members of the agriculture and conservation communities, but public officials and legislators hustled and bustled around the grounds to check out the displays and taste the food.</p>

<p>The morning held an informational meeting for a joint group of Pennsylvania House and Senate Agriculture &amp; Rural Affairs committee members to talk about the recent updates on the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Phase III of the Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). Present were Chairman Sen. Elder Vogel, House Chairman Martin Causer, House Minority Chairman Eddie Day Pashinski, Rep. Sid Kavulich, Rep. Pam DeLissio, Rep. Stephen Bloom, Rep. David Millard, Rep. David Zimmerman, Rep. Russ Diamond, Rep. Dan Moul, Rep. John Lawrence, Rep. Rich Irvin, Rep. Mark Keller, Rep. Mike Tobash, and Sen. Sharif Street. The participation of the committees at Ag Progress Days speaks to the importance of understanding water quality concerns in Pennsylvania and making real changes with solutions that may be difficult.</p>

<p>The committees heard from Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Patrick McDonnell and Department of Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding on the current status of the Watershed Implementation Plan for the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Secretary McDonnell shared that to date, 12 percent of all Pennsylvania farmland has been inspected by the DEP or partners and staff members in the state&rsquo;s Conservation Districts (280 total; assessing almost 246,000 acres), which the Wolf administration has touted as being a very successful first year of agricultural inspections for nutrient management and erosion and soil plans on hand.</p>

<p>One great statistic to hear from Secretary McDonnell is that 60 percent of all Pennsylvania farms have plans in place, but more work is needed in this regard. To address the remaining 40 percent of farms, McDonnell and Redding asked the legislators for help to figure out a good way to collaborate and provide support to farmers. <strong>Here, more funding for technical assistance to farmers at the state level is critical and more incentives for developing and implementing management plans would go a long way.</strong></p>

<p>Highlighted during the hearing was the fact that Pennsylvania has its own unique challenges to overcome, but the state is required to meetwater quality goals not only due to the federal government&rsquo;s Total Maximum Daily Load &ndash; a pollution diet &ndash; the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, and the Environmental Rights Amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution, but because Pennsylvanians believe in the right to clean water. Pennsylvanians deserve all streams, creeks, and rivers to be swimmable and fishable once again. Making real changes and investments by the state and federal governments would make significant progress in meeting our water quality goals.</p>

<p>As of the hearing, Pennsylvania is responsible for 69 percent of the remaining basin-wide nitrogen load reduction that is needed by 2025, and more than 80 percent of this is because of agricultural run-off, our state&rsquo;s largest non-point source pollution.</p>

<p>The state&rsquo;s agency officials did bring some good news, however; the water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and our local waterways are largely getting better. This is happening as a direct result of farmers, conservationists, environmental professionals, and governments at every level coming together to brainstorm and put solutions in place.</p>

<p>The past year was successful in that the Penn State University College of Agricultural Sciences executed a farm conservation survey that showed farmers are doing a great deal of best management practice work on their own dime, but it is more evident that the state needs to step up. Our conservation districts are doing great work at relying on their relationships with farmers to collect data and empower farmers to be good stewards with help, and the DEP Chesapeake Bay office noted recent successes, such as setting up an urban stormwater cost-share program, agricultural best management practice special projects, an established WIP Steering Committee, and a road map for execution.</p>

<p>Secretary McDonnell stressed the importance of taking state and federal dollars and spending on conservation practices in specific, targeted watersheds which could use the most help. Secretary Redding made a great point to the legislators at Ag Progress Days by noting though the state receives funding from the federal Farm Bill and the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program, there is a very real gap in funding for agriculture best management practice implementation. <strong>Much more money is needed from public private partnership involvement, but primarily more money needs to be invested by the state government.</strong></p>

<p>Following the legislative meeting at the College of Agricultural Sciences building, state legislators and the agency heads joined Governor Tom Wolf for remarks at the College&rsquo;s Ag Government and Industry luncheon. Congressman Glenn &ldquo;GT&rdquo; Thompson and Congressman Dwight Evans also took part in the lunch, and later spoke at a town hall discussion on agriculture issues from Pennsylvania stakeholders.</p>

<p>Governor Wolf reminded attendees that, &ldquo;Clean water is a problem for everyone in this state,&rdquo; not just for the agriculture sector, or for those in certain parts of the state. Wolf nudged his colleagues in the legislature in a friendly manner to finish the state budget and make sure that there is more money for clean water and fixing this crisis in the Commonwealth. Wolf went on to say that he wants to make sure that Pennsylvania is a place for agriculture to thrive and wants to make sure that the state government is not standing in the way&hellip;especially because it may be lacking financial resources to help, which is now a recurring, and unacceptable, theme in the Keystone State.</p>

<p>Secretary Redding and Secretary McDonnell were adamant in their take that the goals should be coequal and not competing. We need to do whatever we can in Pennsylvania to advocate for viable farms and champion clean water at the same time. We don&rsquo;t have to choose, but our state needs leadership and dedicated funding for our water resources to make this happen.</p>

<p><strong>State legislators, you&rsquo;re up to bat.</strong></p>

<p>As was mentioned again during the hearing today, we all contribute to our state&rsquo;s waterway impairment problems, so we can &ndash; and must &ndash; all be part of the solution.</p>

We Are All the Watershed: Ag Progress Days in Happy Valley,8/16/2017,"<p>The annual <a href=""http://agsci.psu.edu/apd"">Ag Progress Days</a>, hosted by Penn State University&rsquo;s College of Agriculture Sciences, kicked off Tuesday morning in Furnace, Pa. Each year, the college and hundreds of partners, including nongovernmental organizations, governments, and businesses, join together to discuss, demonstrate, and display advances in agriculture.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s events highlight the growing importance of water quality and conservation efforts needed in the agriculture sector. Much has been done to advance sustainability in recent years by farmers, but more work is ahead.</p>

<p><strong>As I serve as PennFuture&rsquo;s Campaign Manager for Watershed Advocacy, I am spending this week at Ag Days learning from farmers and agriculture professionals, as well as talking to partners and educating participants about the essential connection between environmental stewardship in farming and clean water.</strong></p>

<p>Pennsylvania boasts more than 85,000 miles of rivers and streams. These streams flow through farms, backyards, cities, and towns. No matter where we live, we each play a unique and essential role to protect our water. The exhibits, lectures, and eventsthis year are educating attendees about riparian buffers on farmland, linking land preservation to water quality goals, and implementing best management practices, including no-till farming, streambank fencing, and tree plantings.</p>

<p><strong>The theme that has resonated with me throughout the day, from driving through the mountains of Huntingdon County, over the Juniata River, and alongside the famous and pristine Spruce Creek in Centre County, is the idea of connecting the land ethic of farmers to a culture of stewardship for our streams, creeks, and rivers.</strong></p>

<p>I began the day with a session on using drones for agriculture and conservation practices, and participated in a town hall meeting with the PA Department of Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding on the high priority issues facing Pennsylvania agriculture and water quality. As the day unfolded, I heard from head Penn State University researchers who developed and executed the recent PA Farm Conservation Survey, learned about using live stakes for stream restoration, trees for trout, and creating community partnerships to make a difference.</p>

<p>Today, the Pennsylvania State House Agriculture Committee will discuss the latest on clean water goals as part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed clean up efforts, and Governor Tom Wolf will host a luncheon to discuss agriculture and conservation in the Commonwealth.Congressman Glenn &lsquo;GT&rsquo; Thompson (PA-5, R) will host a&quot;Barnyard Discussion,&quot;to hear directly from stakeholders from various sectors of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s agriculture.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about this show each year is the fact that people come together in partnership with environmental conservation groups, agriculture trade associations, alliances, and coalitions across the gamut of school of thought and background. Local, state, and federal government representatives also come together to talk about the state of agriculture, farming life, and conservation in Pennsylvania. And we are all working together for solutions.</p>

<p>I was reminded repeatedly through the visits to the seed and machinery companies, the farmers asking the tough questions about the best cover crops for clean water, and the college students presenting on livestock and baling hay:<strong> we all make up the watershed.</strong></p>

<p>Each one of us is a member of a specific watershed with a home and a real effect on our streams. While working to restore and protect our public natural resources may seem like a daunting challenge with many complexities, we can each do our part by supporting our local farmers, planting trees, participating in stream clean-ups, joining watershed associations, and reminding our state and national legislators the importance of standing up for our water.<br />
<br />
Through collective action and public participation, we can all make a difference. We are all the watershed.</p>

From Despair to Determination: An Inconvenient Sequel,8/15/2017,"<p>As I made my way to the movie theater for a free screening of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huX1bmfdkyA"">An Inconvenient Sequel</a>, Al Gore&rsquo;s follow-up documentary to the game-changing original, I braced myself.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it. Environmental advocacy work in the last six months has felt a lot like an emotional rollercoaster, one in which the Trump administration has attacked almost every aspect of in terms of our rights to clean air, pure water and a healthy climate. The situation at the state level looks just as bleak at times, with the power of oil and gas at the forefront of the state budget battle. I needed some kind of a mental boost, and wasn&rsquo;t sure what this documentary had in store for me.</p>

<p>The free Friday night screening, generously provided by The Heinz Endowments and Climate Reality, pleasantly surprised me in the way it inspired hope, despite the significant challenges ahead.</p>

<p>The film walks viewers through current scientific facts surrounding the threat of extreme weather, sea level rise, the impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable people, and Gore&rsquo;s personal road to his current position as global climate change leader. There are incredible scenes featuring leaders from both sides of the aisle who see the issue of climate change as an opportunity to invest in clean energy, proving that working in a united way is possible if we just take the time to be open. The film is also as much about never giving up as it is about the climate crisis, and I appreciated Gore&rsquo;s personal reflections on the fact that oftentimes, the plans we have for life are not exactly what life has planned for us.</p>

<p>I felt personally connected to the film as Gore said outright that he knows many environmental advocates grapple with despair and moving forward on an almost daily basis. Sometimes, the uphill battle to protect our environment seems like one that will never reach the top of the mountain. But in the end, the film highlighted the undeniable progress that has been made in terms of clean energy, and it lifted my spirits and motivated me more than ever.</p>

<p>What I walked away with as I left the movie theater was so much more powerful than the despair I had initially expected. I walked away with the knowledge and the belief that this movement &ndash; our movement working towards a clean energy future &ndash; is so much larger than President Donald Trump. While we are certainly up against the powerful interests of dark money and a democracy crippled by the oil and gas industry &ndash; one man simply cannot stop a world of people working for change.</p>

<p>President Trump can deny climate change all he wants, but as I watched the tireless, thankless policy work that went into the formation of the Paris Climate Agreement, watched hundreds of leaders buckling down to find shared solutions, to find a healthier future that the world can see collectively as one, I realized: it&rsquo;s not up to President Trump to stop us.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s up to us to keep going.</strong></p>

<p>Our work matters. Your work matters. Whether it&rsquo;s at the borough level, the city level, or the state level, it is up to each one of us to make individual choices that move towards a clean energy future. No step is too small, and together, we can continue our momentum and progress.</p>

Protecting Lake Erie and Reforming the Renewable Fuel Standard,8/8/2017,"<p>Forty-five years ago, Lake Erie was so polluted that TIME Magazine stated it was, &ldquo;in danger of dying by suffocation.&rdquo; Although there was a massive clean-up effort on the local, state, and federal level, Lake Erie once again experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in recorded history in 2011, with a peak intensity over three times greater than any previously observed bloom.</p>

<p>Where are these algal blooms coming from? Although there are many causes, increased corn production in recent years is an important factor. Corn is one of the most chemical dependent crops. It loves phosphate fertilizers, and so does algae. When it rains, the water that runs off of corn fields can be loaded with extremely high volumes of phosphorous nutrients. When this pollution lands in the shallow western basin of Lake Erie, it promotes rapid and massive growth of unhealthy, even toxic green slime.</p>

<p>In 2014, the city of Toledo, Ohio suffered a drinking water shortage affecting half a million residents for three days, thanks to yet another toxic algal bloom in Lake Erie. This event was even worse than the 2011 occurrence. Recorded algae levels were 1,000 times higher than levels deemed safe for drinking water by the World Health Organization. The disaster closed down beaches, which had dramatic effects on fishing, tourism, and recreation industries, all while killing and pushing marine life out of its way.</p>

<p>As someone who grew up in Erie, this deeply concerns me because so much of my life has revolved around the lake and its tributaries. When I was young, my grandfather taught me how to fish at the mouth of 4-mile creek. I probably earned most of my Boy Scout Merit Badges at Presque Isle, and of course, I&rsquo;ll never forget that perfect first date as we went to the top of the Bicentennial Tower at the Dock and watched the sun set over the bay. </p>

<p>I also remember observing just how fragile our ecosystem was when transoceanic ships introduced zebra mussels to the lake in the early 90&rsquo;s. Just like algal blooms, this invasive species had a swift and devastating effect on the lake and all of us who lived near it. As a young person, I took all of these things for granted, but now I worry that my grandchildren won&rsquo;t have the luxury of making these sametypes of memories. We&rsquo;re all connected to the lake in one way or another, and I believe that it is our duty to preserve it for generations to come. </p>

<p>The Renewable Fuel Standard was a federal mandate passed into law in 2005 to blend renewable fuels into conventional gasoline. The authors of the law meant to drive innovation and development of truly renewable cellulosic fuels, but have instead driven more and more conversion of natural areas to corn fields.</p>

<p>Although the law was passed with good intentions, it has resulted in a major transformation of the landscape with devastating effects, including degrading the water quality of the Great Lakes with corn-fertilizer driven algal blooms. This occurs as a result of agricultural runoff during storms.</p>

<p>We must reform the Renewable Fuel Standard so it gives farmers more choices to manage agricultural runoff and so that it promotes biofuels made from sources other than corn to protect our Great Lakes that we cherish and call home.</p>

Moratorium on Fracking in the Delaware River Basin is Critical to Protect Our Water,8/7/2017,"<div>The Delaware River is the longest un-dammed river east of the Mississippi. Over 15 million people across four states - Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware - rely on the river for a variety of consumptive and non-consumptive uses, including for drinking water, agricultural, recreational, and industrial uses. In Pennsylvania, this great water resource brings millions of dollars in recreation and tourism.</div>

<div></div>

<div>And yet, there is controversy in Pennsylvania over whether to open up this critical Basin to natural gas development, in particular the unconventional horizontal, high-volume hydraulic fracturing method, commonly known as &ldquo;fracking&rdquo;. So far, the interstate commission that oversees the use and protection of the Delaware River resources &ndash; the Delaware River Basin Commission (&ldquo;DRBC&rdquo;) &ndash; has not allowed fracking in the basin, citing the known short- and long-term risks and lack of proven protections of water resources. But the pressure has been mounting on the DRBC to allow natural gas extraction in the Basin. </div>

<div></div>

<div>PennFuture supports the current moratorium on fracking in the Delaware River Basin, is advocating for a permanent ban on natural gas extraction in the Basin, and has partnered with Conservation Voters of PA and others to get thousands to sign onto a petition asking DRBC to permanently ban unconventional natural resource extraction in the Basin. PennFuture will resist any proposal that threatens this great water resource in Pennsylvania.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>The Delaware River Basin Commission</strong></div>

<div>Established in 1961, the Delaware River Basin Commission created a federal Compact between the four Basin states and the federal government with the purpose of managing and restoring water quality to the Delaware River. </div>

<div></div>

<div>Before the DRBC was created, the Delaware River was largely considered to be an open sewer. The water was so polluted that it peeled paint from ships, made people ill just from the smell, and, in parts, could not sustain fish and other aquatic life. But now, the Delaware is hailed as one of the world&rsquo;s top water quality restoration success stories, and its improved water quality has allowed river-based recreation to become one of the major economic drivers for the four-state area. This success was made possible by the DRBC, which allows for a unified approach to managing a river system without regard to political boundaries.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>How the DRBC Protects the Basin Resources: the Compact</strong></div>

<div>The Compact charges the Basin states with developing and adopting water resource programs. Commission programs include water quality protection, water supply allocation, regulatory review, water conservation initiatives, watershed planning, drought management, flood loss reduction, education/outreach, and recreation.</div>

<div></div>

<div>One of the more critical programs, designed to &ldquo;keep the clean water clean,&rdquo; is the Special Protection Waters program, which prevents degradation in streams and rivers considered to have exceptionally high scenic, recreational, ecological, and/or water supply values through stricter control of wastewater discharges and reporting requirements.</div>

<div></div>

<div>In addition to developing water resource programs, the DRBC has the authority to regulate certain activities in the Basin in order to protect and restore the water quality of the Delaware. According to Section 3 of the Compact, the DRBC must review and approve applications for any projects that may have a substantial effect on the Basin&rsquo;s water resources, and approval may only be given when the Commissioners find and determine that the project would not substantially impair the water resources. Specifically, in recognizing the importance of protecting high quality waters &ndash; such as Special Protection Waters &ndash; the DRBC has the discretion to require project sponsors to obtain DRBC approval even where those projects may not meet other review and approval thresholds.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>The Substantial Risks to Basin Resources from Gas Drilling</strong><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></div>

<div>Pennsylvania is no stranger to natural resource extraction. But high pressure hydraulic fracturing used to produce natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations poses substantial risks to fresh water resources. The process uses several million gallons of water, sand and chemical additives, under immense pressure, to release natural gas from deep inside the earth. Estimates vary, but about ten percent of this chemical mixture returns to the surface as what the industry refers to as &ldquo;flowback water.&rdquo; The fluids are high in dissolved solids and may contain sand, heavy metals, oil, grease, man-made organic chemicals and radioactive elements. This fluid would cause serious pollution if discharged into Pennsylvania waters without treatment. This means that millions of gallons of contaminated water must be stored and eventually transported off-site across Pennsylvania for treatment or disposal. </div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>The DRBC has identified three significant areas of concern regarding fracking in the Basin:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Withdrawals of groundwater and surface water for drilling projects in the Marcellus Shale may reduce the volume of water available for other purposes, such as drinking water supply, aquatic life, and recreation;</li>
	<li>Drilling operations may result in additional discharge of pollutants into groundwater; and</li>
	<li>The flowback water requires disposal and treatment which has the potential to pollute Delaware River Basin waters.</li>
</ul>

<div>While running for office, Tom Wolf, the current Governor of Pennsylvania and one of the five Commissioners, made it a campaign promise to continue supporting a moratorium on fracking in the Delaware River Basin, and recently reiterated his position that gas production should not take place in the Basin.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Thus, it&rsquo;s no wonder the DRBC has been hesitant to allow fracking to occur within the Basin.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Current Status of Fracking in the Basin: The &ldquo;De Facto&rdquo; Moratorium</strong></div>

<div>In response to the noticable increase in the number of active and planned natural gas extracion projects within the Delaware River Basin, between 2009 and 2010, the Executive Director of DRBC issued several formal determinations that set the stage for the current moratorium on natural gas development in the Basin. Citing the potential significant environmental and water quality impacts, these decisions prohibited any natural gas extraction project (including associated infrastructure and exploratory wells) from occuring in the Basin within the drainage area of Special Protection Waters wihtout first applying for and obtaining DRBC approval. The determination also stated that DRBC would be promulgating regulations pertaining to natural gas development projects in the Basin.</div>

<div></div>

<div>In 2010, the DRBC issued draft Water Quality Regulations (Article 7) to protect the water resources of the Delaware River Basin during the construction and operation of natural gas development projects. The draft regulations apply broadly to all &ldquo;natural gas development projects,&rdquo; including the construction and operation of all natural gas wells in the Basin, regardless of the target geologic formation, whether a well is for production or exploration, or whether high-volume or low-volume hydraulic fracturing is contemplated. The DRBC received approximately 69,000 public comments on the draft regulations. Despite revisions in 2011, the Commissioners declined to take a final vote on adoption of the draft regulations, citing the need for more information on the potential harmful environmental impacts. This delay has resulted in the current &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; moratorium on gas development in the Basin.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Court Ruled: DRBC Has Authority to Regulate Fracking</strong></div>

<div>In May 2016, a group of mineral rights owners sued the DRBC in federal district court in Pennsylvania, challenging the Commission&rsquo;s authority to regulate gas development in the Basin. In a decision issued this March, the federal court concluded that the DRBC has the authority to regulate natural gas extraction activities, including well pads and related drilling, fracturing, and operation of natural gas wells under the Compact. Wayne Land and Mineral Group, LLC v. DRBC (M.D. Pa, Mar. 23, 2017) WLMG filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on April 7, 2017. The Court of Appeals has not yet issued its decision.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Under the District Court&rsquo;s ruling, WLMG, and any other person seeking to undertake natural gas development projects in the Basin, must obtain the DRBC&rsquo;s approval before undertaking those activities. And the DRBC has indicated that it will not consider or approve any natural gas extraction projects in the Basin without final regulations.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>

<div>The DRBC has identified specific and serious concerns about the risk of harm posed by unconventional natural gas development in the Basin, and has held off on allowing such risky extraction unless and until it can ensure the protection of the water resources of Basin.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Considering the precious nature of the Basin&rsquo;s resources, and the possible long-term impact that natural gas development can have on water resources, PennFuture is calling on the DRBC to issue a permanent ban on fracking in the Basin. </div>

<div></div>

<div>We cant afford the risk of serious environmental harm that may result from wide-spread natural gas development in the Basin. It&rsquo;s taken the DRBC over half a century to bring the Delaware River back from the brink of collapse, and now is not the time to jeopardize those efforts.</div>

<div></div>

Improve Your Community’s Stormwater Pollution Problem,8/3/2017,"<div>Pennsylvania has a great opportunity to improve water quality by reducing pollution in the coming years through the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s new Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit.</div>

<div></div>

<div>MS4 communities operate separate storm sewer systems, which includes storm drains that take in rain water from streets, leading it directly to local waterways.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Those MS4 communities that release stormwater into polluted waterbodies in their areas, as well as those located in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, are required to submit Pollutant Reduction Plans (PRP) or a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Plan to address the steps they will take to reduce water pollution over the next five years.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Municipalities must submit these PRP and TMDL plans in addition to their permit applications to PA DEP by September 16, 2017 following a 45-day public participation period. These plans detail the steps municipalities will follow to reduce known water pollutants, including sediment and phosphorus in the coming years.</div>

<div></div>

<div>In addition to the plans, municipalities are required to follow best management practices and document their progress under six minimum control measures, including:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Public education and outreach</li>
	<li>Public participation and involvement</li>
	<li>Illicit discharge detection and elimination</li>
	<li>Stormwater runoff control at construction sites</li>
	<li>Post-construction stormwater management</li>
	<li>Pollution prevention and good housekeeping</li>
</ul>

<div>Many of these municipalities have already made their plans available for public comment in order to meet the September deadline. Watershed community members, advocates, and experts have the chance to help shape the effectiveness of these plans by writing and submitting comments to their municipalities&rsquo; PRP and TMDL plans.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Luckily, there are resources available to assist those reviewing and commenting on these plans. <strong>Here are a few resources created by PennFuture and the Pennsylvania Campaign for Clean Water Stormwater Workgroup to help individuals, groups, and organizations to write and submit comments on these plans:</strong></div>

Take Action: Stop Trump's Repeal of Clean Water Rule,8/1/2017,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency has opened a public comment period to consider repealing the Clean Water Rule. If repealed by the federal government, the rivers, streams, and wetlands that provide Pennsylvanians with safe drinking water, outdoor recreation activities, and water-based tourism will be at risk.</p>

<p>Marking yet another assault on the environment by President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration, we need your help in letting our leaders know that clean water is a right that all people share.</p>

<p>The Clean Water Rule protects those small streams and wetlands that nearly 8 million Pennsylvanians rely on for safe drinking water. It also protects nearly 11,000 miles of creeks and streams across the state, which contributes more than $4 billion to our economy through outdoor recreation, breweries, and other sources.</p>

<p>In addition, this regulatory roll-back would adversely impact Pennsylvanians. 63% of Pennsylvanians get their drinking water from sources that rely on small streams that are protected by the Clean Water Rule. With this Rule, protections were restored to 10,720 miles of streams that feed into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s drinking water sources and thousands of acres of wetlands that provide flood protection, recharge groundwater supplies, filter pollution, and provide essential wildlife habitat are safeguarded.</p>

<p>Americans want the Clean Water Rule. During its 200 day public comment period, over 800,000 Americans submitted positive comments and recent research from the League of Conservation Voters shows that 79% of voters want to allow the Clean Water Rule to move forward. Further, the Clean Water Rule is based on sound science, including 1,200 peer-reviewed studies and extensive stakeholder outreach. This Rule is also good for business. The American Sustainable Business Council found in a survey that 80% of small business owners favor federal protections for clean water in small streams and headwaters. Repealing this rule would endanger more than 20 million acres of vital wetlands across the country.</p>

Shifting Away from Coal Toward Renewable Energy,7/31/2017,"<p><em>This opinion piece appeared in the <a href=""http://www.observer-reporter.com/20170729/commentary_we_should_shift_away_from_coal_toward_renewables"">Washington Observer-Reporter </a>on July 29, 2017 in a point / counterpoint feature about the coal industry in Pennsylvania.</em></p>

<p>Any conversation about the future of coal must be candid about a number of realities. Our energy system is changing rapidly toward clean energy and away from fossil fuel. Our political class can either lead toward economic and environmental success or continue to bury its head in the sand and be defeated. Part of the problem is the public debate on coal has been layered with myths, misdirection, and lies that have derailed a forward-looking discussion on how we harness and use energy, as well as how it impacts hardworking Americans.</p>

<p>First, we must discuss the reality of climate change. The facts are clear: we cannot hope to keep the world&rsquo;s temperature at a safe level if we continue to rely on carbon-intensive fossil fuels like coal. The United States has already emitted more carbon pollution than any other country in history, and has a moral and ethical responsibility to do its fair share to mitigate the danger. Instead, our climate policy is rife with weakness, denial, and obstruction, rather than providing an economically beneficial pathway to a cleaner, prosperous energy future.</p>

<p>Second, coal remains dangerous to the communities that surround it. Burning coal releases a wide variety of cancer-causing, lung-damaging pollutants, including mercury, acid gases, and smog-forming pollutants, which result in hospitalizations and deaths. Coal mining itself permanently scars our environment and damages our land and water &ndash; just ask anyone in the old coal towns scattered around Pennsylvania. Coal isn&rsquo;t clean, and we can&rsquo;t forget how it has harmed generations of workers and communities.</p>

<p>Third, there is no such thing as a &ldquo;war on coal.&rdquo; Tree huggers, former presidents, and government regulations aren&rsquo;t killing coal. Rather, simple economics are leading to its demise as cheaper alternatives replace it in the market. Natural gas and renewable energy are winning the day. As a result, coal industry leaders are trying to cut every corner they can find. They&rsquo;re using automation to replace workers. They&rsquo;re spending money they say they don&rsquo;t have to lobby for even more government subsidies. And, in some high-profile cases, they have been caught cutting corners on their safety and environmental responsibilities. Underneath all of the war-on-coal rhetoric is a textbook case of industry trying to skirt its responsibilities to its workers and environment to make a few more dollars. We all pay the price.</p>

<p>Fourth, don&rsquo;t be duped by promises of metallurgic coal. Coal has been the main source of power for our blast furnaces and steel mills, but even so, its future is not assured. Steel manufacturers, such as U.S. Steel, are already publically discussing plans to replace coal and coke used in steel mills with natural gas as a cost-cutting measure, and the rise of international carbon tariffs could limit international markets for steel made in coal-fired mills.</p>

<p>Fifth, political leaders are doing coal workers a disservice. Rather than recognizing that the United States is under a generational shift in energy and providing support for its workers and a path to more prosperous jobs, they&rsquo;re instead providing lip service, myths, and false hope.</p>

<p>Policymakers should be passing legislation to rebuild old coal communities, fund reclamation of abandoned mining operations that are polluting our streams, and provide new job opportunities for coal miners. Coal workers have provided a critical service to society by lighting our homes and providing heating for our families. We should ensure that those workers are treated with respect and provided with good-paying jobs in new industries.</p>

<p>With the industry in a permanent state of decline, there are policy choices to be made. Doing nothing is probably the worst decision. If we take that path, we will face not only the worst effects of climate change, but the workers and the communities that rely on coal will continue to suffer.</p>

<p>Further subsidizing coal is an equally terrible choice. In Ohio, coal plant owners have lobbied to force consumers to pay above-market prices for coal power. Taking a similar path in Pennsylvania might keep coal plants profitable a little while longer, but will raise electricity prices. With many coal plants near the end of their expected lives, that would only be a short-term solution. When the inevitable collapse comes, the fall will be that much harder.</p>

<p>The best alternative is to provide real support to coal workers and provide them a path to work in next-generation energy industries. We must also account for the environmental and public health damage caused by coal and include that in the price &ndash; ending a significant subsidy to coal that it has benefitted from for more than 100 years. Pennsylvania can use that revenue from the cut subsidies to help coal communities rebuild their economies, clean up their coal piles, and provide cleaner, more prosperous jobs for its families.</p>

Legislators Target a Severance Tax – in Name Only,7/26/2017,"<p>Over the last few weeks, state legislators have <a href=""/Blog-Item-Harrisburg-Punts-on-Environmental-Protection-in-the-State-Budget-Again"">prioritized raiding conservation funds </a>and cutting environmental protection agencies under the guise of getting serious about balancing the budget.</p>

<p>This was no more evident than when the House of Representatives recently considered a &ldquo;severance tax in name only,&rdquo; in which legislators proposed changing the name of the natural gas &ldquo;Impact Fee&rdquo; to &ldquo;severance tax.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>In other words, the House proposed last minute legislative deception to make it look like it passed new revenue.</strong> It&rsquo;s like saying they balanced the state budget by passing a law that changes the word &ldquo;debt&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;surplus,&rdquo; or rebranding carbon pollution as &ldquo;good for farmers and agriculture&rdquo; and calling it <a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/article/295098/carbon-emissions-are-good-robert-zubrin"">promising for the planet.</a></p>

<p><strong>The Fake Severance Tax Gambit</strong></p>

<p>On Saturday, July 21, the House was convened to develop, debate, and vote on bills that would raise enough revenue to pay for the budget the legislature passed a few weeks earlier. (i) Of environmental concern, legislators proposed taking money from funds dedicated to land conservation, supporting parks, farmland preservation, and water pollution projects to balance the budget. (ii)</p>

<p>The legislature doesn&rsquo;t have to take a sledgehammer to these programs as it has many other revenue options at its disposal, including some that have significant support among the general public. <strong>One of those ideas is implementing a severance tax on natural gas drilling, which has received support from <a href=""http://www.politicspa.com/rmu-poll-finds-support-of-same-sex-marriage-and-extraction-tax/58349/"">58 percent of the public when polled.</a></strong></p>

<p>As such, the House called an Energy and Environmental Resources Committee hearing on July 22to vote on severance tax proposals &ndash; House Bill 113 (Rep. Harper, R) &ndash; which would levy a 3.5 percent severance tax and use the revenue to pay down the pension liability and help balance the budget.</p>

<p><strong>Rather than take up the bill on its merits, House legislators concocted a plan to replace the bill with language that renames the already existing &ldquo;Impact Fee&rdquo; on gas wells a &ldquo;severance tax.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><u><strong>I&rsquo;ll state that again so it sinks in:</strong></u><strong> Instead of debating a real severance tax, the legislature wanted to rename an existing fee, and call it a good day&rsquo;s work.</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, the House didn&rsquo;t follow through with the fake severance tax gambit because members were sent home after an overall budget agreement couldn&rsquo;t be made. But it&rsquo;s indicative of how many more of our legislators are interested in gutting conservation and environmental protection rather than coming up with an equitable budget solution that doesn&rsquo;t require doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania Doesn&rsquo;t Have a Severance Tax</strong></p>

<p>The fake severance tax gambit highlights the common myths holding back its passage, the most prominent being industry&rsquo;s charge that Pennsylvania already levies a severance tax and instead calls it by a different name &ndash; an &ldquo;Impact Fee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s true that the Commonwealth charges a fee on gas wells, it&rsquo;s much different than a severance tax, and the distinction means Pennsylvania taxpayers are leaving hundreds of millions of dollars in potential revenue on the table.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Impact Fee is an annual charge on gas wells that is tiered to the price of natural gas and declines over time. It&rsquo;s structured to provide more revenue as the number of gas wells increases. Revenue flows back to municipalities to invest in fixing infrastructure degraded or oversubscribed by increased industrial use. It&rsquo;s a popular program and serves an important purpose, supporting local municipalities with small local tax bases to deal with rising infrastructure costs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a severance tax charges a percentage of the average market price of the gas extracted, plus a flat fee for every thousand cubic feet of gas extracted. It&rsquo;s structured to provide more revenue as the price of gas increases, or as the amount of extracted gas increases.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s easy to see why the gas industry doesn&rsquo;t want a severance tax and pushes the argument we already have one.</strong></p>

<p>Their top goal is to increase the price of natural gas in Pennsylvania to increase their profits. They&rsquo;re doing so by limiting new drilling, and building new pipeline projects to sell the gas outside of the state and, more importantly, outside of the United States at a higher price.</p>

<p><strong>As the value of gas increases, a severance tax would become more lucrative, whereas Impact Fee revenue would remain static or decline. Keeping the Impact Fee is more profitable to an already very profitable gas industry.</strong></p>

<p>This act of corporate trickery is having a ripple effect throughout the state budget.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.pennbpc.org/no-matter-how-you-figure-it-severance-tax-generates-more-revenue-impact-fee-and-clearly-better-deal"">The Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center estimates </a>that the Commonwealth would raise at least $480 million more revenue per year through a severance tax than the Impact Fee.</p>

<p>In other words, Pennsylvania is leaving a significant amount of budget revenue on the table by not levying a severance tax and are instead cutting core environmental protection programs to try and balance the budget.</p>

<p><strong>Calling a Spade a Spade</strong></p>

<p>To be fair, balancing the budget always includes a mix of budget cuts and new revenue. Both are needed to equitably close a <a href=""http://www.witf.org/state-house-sound-bites/2017/06/breaking-down-the-budget-the-political-path-to-pas-structural-deficit.php"">$3 billion structural deficit</a> that has dragged on too long. Calling a spade a spade, the legislature isn&rsquo;t acting fairly and is eviscerating environmental protection and conservation programs and selling it as needed budget cuts.</p>

<p>For over a decade, the legislature has stripped to the bone the Commonwealth&rsquo;s environmental protection programs and support for our parks and forests. These agencies currently can&rsquo;t complete their most basic functions, like protecting the public&rsquo;s <a href=""http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2017/02/02/u-s-warns-pennsylvania-over-safe-drinking-water-violations/"">drinking water</a> or cleaning up the <a href=""http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/pennsylvania-lags-on-chesapeake-bay-cleanup/article_2ff5229e-40ba-11e6-98be-df8ac8dc9c42.html"">Susquehanna River basin</a>. Parks and forests are understaffed and are sitting on years of past maintenance backlog <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2013/02/senate-budget-hearing-dcnr-has-1.html"">exceeding $1 billion.</a></p>

<p>Certainly, times are tough for state budgeting, but these fundamental state programs have given <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2017/06/house-senate-governor-agree-on-31996b.html"">more than enough</a> toward balancing the budget. Rather than dangerously cutting environmental protection programs yet again, as well as taking dedicated money from land conservation and water projects, legislators need to look elsewhere to balance their budget.</p>

<p><strong>This includes taking a hard look at their rhetoric around a severance tax (and other potential revenue raisers) and asking whether protecting <a href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/26/can-the-marcellus-shale-continue-fueling-big-profi.aspx"">soaring</a> gas industry profits is worth harming the Commonwealth&rsquo;s environment and public health.</strong></p>

<p><em>(i)Note that the legislature already slashed environmental investments this year. The FY2017-18 budget cuts water, land, and air protection and conservation programs by 2 percent to 7 percent compared to last year&rsquo;s budget (and up to 33 percent compared to these budgets 15 years ago).<br />
(ii)Specifically, the legislature was targeting: (1) Environmental Stewardship Fund, which supports everything from greenways, trails, and community parks to water cleanup and wildlife habitat protection; (2) Keystone Recreation, Park, and Conservation Fund, which is the chief way Pennsylvania conserves and protects public lands and historic sites as well as invests in libraries, public parks, and new lands for recreation; and (3) Farmland Preservation Fund, which is how state and county governments purchase conservation easements to preserve Pennsylvania farms to slow the selloff of those lands for development.</em></p>

Meet the Donor: Rodney Gasch,7/25/2017,"<p>Rodney Gasch, a retired freelance writer and current president of the Latin American Children&rsquo;s Fund and president of Historic Harmony, Inc., has been a long-time PennFuture donor. In 2016, Rodney and his wife, Laurie, decided to change things up and become monthly supporters.</p>

<p>As Rodney said, &ldquo;Giving once a year is important, but PennFuture, like most nonprofits, has expenses 12 months a year.&rdquo; It was an easy decision for he and his wife to make the switch.</p>

<p>Rodney grew up in eastern Wisconsin on a small family dairy farm. His father participated in land conservation and farmed carefully to avoid soil erosion, giving Rodney the bird&rsquo;s eye view to learn about the importance of both stewardship of the land, and erosion control.</p>

<p>On their farm, they practiced contour tillage (tilling perpendicular to a slope), strip cropping (alternating long strips of row crops, such as corn, with long strips of dense hay crops) and utilized grass waterways (broad, shallow channels planted in grass that move surface water across slopes without causing soil erosion).</p>

<p>In 1993, Rodney and his wife moved to Pennsylvania as Laurie accepted a position at the University of Pittsburgh. They bought a non-functioning farm with a great barn and nice farmhouse. Most of the land had grown in with trees. While it is beautiful to look at, Rodney says the most successful plants on the farm seem to be poison ivy, multi flora rose, and autumn olive, the latter two growing into dense thickets that can crowd out native species. Rodney worked in marketing communications as a freelance writer, specializing in product literature and direct mail for agricultural and equipment manufacturers.</p>

<p>Rodney and Laurie are the proud parents of William and Noah, whom they adopted from El Salvador and Guatemala, respectively. Their first adoption 27 years ago spurred an interest in the boys cultures, but Rodney did not get heavily involved in charity work in Central America until 2006.</p>

<p>At the Latin American Childrens fund, Rodney and his team raise money for a rural medical clinic in El Salvador, as well as helping the poor with micro enterprises that build economic stability and self-worth. In Guatemala, a program provides scholarships to help children continue their educations past the sixth grade. Working with local charities that have &ldquo;boots on the ground,&rdquo; they direct their efforts toward issues that are way beyond the reach of rural poor and subsistence farmers.</p>

<p>Historic Harmony, Inc. was founded in 1943, and operates eight properties, including the 1809 Harmony Museum building, which interprets 250 years of rich history in western Pennsylvania. The group provides presentations that include the topics of George Washingtons 1753 mission, the Harmonists, Mennonites, and the Ball Collection of outstanding sporting rifles by 19th century Harmony gunsmith Charles Flowers. Historic Harmony is also home to the oldest Mennonite meetinghouse west of the Allegheny Mountains. It was recently added to the National Register of Historic Places.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Historic Harmony, Inc. asked for PennFuture&rsquo;s help to take on a developer who planned to fill and develop a farm field in a flood plain. While Historic Harmony, Inc. wasn&rsquo;t able to stop the entire process, with PennFuture&rsquo;s help, the organization gained a better understanding of what it could do to prevent the size and scope of the development. Through these efforts, Historic Harmony, Inc. was able to identify and protect several acres of wetlands and prevent the development in the flood way.</p>

<p>Rodney first became interested in supporting PennFuture when Marcellus gas development became a larger statewide topic. Rodney and his wife were some of the first people to sign a Marcellus gas lease in Butler County, long before Marcellus, fracking, and horizontal drilling became household terms. They quickly learned that without strong rules and vigilant oversight, gas companies were prone to cut corners, especially on environmental issues. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Their goals are speed and profits, not land stewardship,&rdquo; notes Rodney. He and his wife felt it was fitting to put some of the money they received from gas development back into a group that would strive to enforce those rules, and be the watchdog over gas drillers and the legislature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We got to thinking, whos going to speak for the environment? Businesses speak for their bottom line. Gas folks can influence the legislature. Who speaks for the land and the water and the air?&rdquo; Rodney thought PennFuture was the best group to stand up for those issues.</p>

<p>In terms of gas drilling, Rodney is not opposed to resource development, but feels that development must be done with a keen eye toward long-term environmental impact.</p>

<p>&quot;Initially, the technology of gas extraction was way ahead of the rules. We have made some progress, but if we didn&rsquo;t have an organization like PennFuture pushing back against the gas drillers and pipeline companies, we could easily repeat the environmental mistakes made In Pennsylvania in the 19th and 20th centuries&mdash;mistakes that gave us acid mine drainage, methane leaks, and abandoned strip mines,&rdquo; Rodney said.<br />
<br />
PennFuture thanks Rodney and Laurie for their monthly support.</p>

Oil Trains: What is the Threat?,7/12/2017,"<p>People have lived amongst trains for more than 200 years. Trains are by far one of the oldest and most successful vehicles of world history, delivering goods and people quickly and efficiently across the United States and beyond.</p>

<p>While it is an incredible machine navigating an incredible rail system, I am often struck by a different perspective of the train, the goods they can carry, and what they represent.</p>

<p>I began to wonder and really think about oil trains about two years ago, when I discovered oil trains have been running through my community. Since then, oil trains have become one of my all-time favorite talking points, and learning about them has changed my life.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny to me now that I have been hearing the whistle of these trains in the far away distance at night since I was a kid. I grew up in Southwest Philadelphia, and oil trains have been a part of my life for years even though I didn&rsquo;t know about them.</p>

<p>Now that I recognize oil trains&mdash;which can have more than 100 cars at one time&mdash;they are hard to miss. Just knowing the cars that they carry are filled with volatile crude oil has changed the way I see these trains.</p>

<p>Seeing the black tanker cars feels like a slap in my face, and an annoyance that keeps popping up in the most unexpected places. These black, pill-shaped disasters-just-waiting-to-happen continuously show up in our neighborhoods. I no longer have to search for them; instead it feels like they are looking for me.</p>

<p>The presence of oil trains in my city, and in the other communities is the embodiment of intimidation. My relationship with these black tanker cars has transformed into one that feels strange and slightly personal. In my head, oil trains are the physical representation of the terms, ideas and institutions that shape our reality. When I see oil trains, I hear the tanker cars whisper, &ldquo;capitalism,&rdquo; &rdquo;classism,&rdquo; &ldquo;colonialism,&rdquo; &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;industry deregulation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;powerlessness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>See, in my eyes, fractivism (anti-fracking activism), and activism around the reality of oil trains are spiritual practices. There is a subliminal message that each tanker car delivers to the communities that they travel through, and a destructive aura that each tanker car exudes. When I look at these trains and listen to their sounds, I hear them spew messages like: &ldquo;This is how things are and will continue to be.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are powerless to change our fossil fuel economy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your health and safety means nothing to the interests of industry and their beneficiaries.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are inferior to the systems that uphold destructive power dynamics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the movement and saying, &ldquo;STOP OIL TRAINS!&rdquo; have become a war cry for activists like me for this very reason. Halting the use of oil trains has the potential to end a lot of the negative things that travel with them. It can end community members having to ask questions like: &ldquo;What is in these tanker cars?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Where are these trains coming from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And ultimately, if we stop oil trains, it can end community members having to ask, &ldquo;What will happen if one of these trains derails?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am currently attending school in Kutztown, Pa. and I still see oil trains traveling through a nearby town named Topton. I haven&rsquo;t heard anyone in this area speak up against oil trains, which feels similar to my experience living in Southwest Philly, and even how I feel now living in Southeast Delaware County (where I have also seen many oil trains passing through).</p>

<p>One consistent observation that I&rsquo;ve had in all of these communities is that the people most impacted and most vulnerable to an oil trains disaster know little to nothing about the existence of them. And that is by far the most frustrating (and motivating) part of this work.</p>

<p>Whenever I travel or move I find oil trains and community members who don&rsquo;t yet know the danger traveling with those tanker cars.</p>

<p>We must inform the people who don&rsquo;t know about the presence and dangers of oil trains and get them involved in standing up for their communities. If we can take that first step together, and if everyone living in a neighborhood next to these oil train routes can also see the reality of oil trains that I see (as a slap in the face to all communities with a right to a safe environment), then I believe that we can begin to make a bigger push to move away from reckless fracking and fossil fuel transportation.</p>

Managing Stormwater: A Leading Cause of Pollution,7/7/2017,"<div>Believe it or not: Stormwater is a leading cause of water pollution.</div>

<div></div>

<div>When it rains or snows, the water flows on the ground, runs off solid (impervious) surfaces collecting pollutants (such as oil, pesticides, sediments, bacteria, and other pollutants) that are on those surfaces, and carries them into our waterways. This &ldquo;runoff&rdquo; can make our waterways an unhealthy place to live, work, and play. Untreated stormwater runoff entering our streams can result in the contamination of our drinking water supplies; prohibitions on swimming, fishing or boating uses; injury or death to aquatic plants and animals; dangers to public health; and increased flooding. </div>

<div></div>

<div>In many places, this stormwater runoff is conveyed through distinct sewer pipes that bypass the wastewater treatment plants and discharge the polluted runoff directly into our streams and lakes. This system is known as a &ldquo;municipal separate storm sewer system&rdquo; or MS4.</div>

<div></div>

<div>In addition to the damage to water quality from MS4s, local governments spend millions of dollars each year trying to rectify the damage to public and private property caused by uncontrolled stormwater runoff. This damage includes repairs to roads, culverts, water, sewer line washouts, flooded homes and yards, the removal of deposited sediment and debris on properties and roads, and repairs of damage to bridges.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Luckily, there are laws out there that protect our waters from polluted stormwater runoff. For example, stormwater from &ldquo;urbanized (define here what that means) areas&rdquo;, which are densely settled area that have population of at least 50,000 as designated by the U.S. Census Bureau, is controlled through a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit under the federal Clean Water Act. Under the NPDES program, the Environmental Protection Agency began issuing Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permits almost 30 years ago. </div>

<div></div>

<div>In order to obtain coverage under an MS4 permit, permittees, including municipalities, must implement a Stormwater Management Plan (&ldquo;SWMP&rdquo;). These SWMPs must include the development and implementation of &ldquo;six minimum measures&rdquo; that prevent or reduce stormwater pollution to the maximum extent possible. The six minimum control measures are:</div>

<ol>
	<li>Public Education and Outreach on Stormwater Impacts</li>
	<li>Public Involvement/Participation</li>
	<li>Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination (IDDE)</li>
	<li>Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control</li>
	<li>Post-Construction Stormwater Management (PCSM)</li>
	<li>Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping</li>
</ol>

<div><a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/FINAL-Guidelines-for-Reviewing-and-Commenting-on-Municipal-Separate-Storm-Sewer-System-Minimum-Control-Measures.pdf""><strong>You can learn more about the MS4 program and the six minimum control measures here</strong></a>.</div>

<div></div>

<div>In Pennsylvania, the Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) administers the MS4program. PADEP issued its first general permit for MS4s in 2003. Although each permit is only supposed to be effective for five years, the PADEP&rsquo;s second MS4 general permit did not become effective until 2013. Even then, after over 10 years of the program&rsquo;s implementation, this second MS4 permit was woefully insufficient. PennFuture took issue with the inadequacy of the PADEP&rsquo;s MS4 program and filed an appeal of PADEP&rsquo;s approval of coverage under the MS4 general permit for Upper Gwynedd Township. (PA Environmental Hearing Board Docket No. 2013-105-L). You can read more about <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/cases"">PennFuture&rsquo;s claims here</a>.</div>

<div></div>

<div>After over a year of negotiations, PennFuture and PADEP entered into a settlement which addressed PennFuture&rsquo;s most important objections, including providing an opportunity for public participation and requiring a demonstration that designated pollution reductions would occur. Thanks to PennFuture&rsquo;s diligence, PADEP was required to include these more stringent conditions in its next MS4 general permit proposal. Many of these conditions were incorporated into <a href=""http://www.elibrary.dep.state.pa.us/dsweb/Get/Document-112608/3800-PM-BCW0100d%20Permit%20SAMPLE%20with%20Signature%20(Final).pdf)"">the new five-year MS4 general permit,</a> which became final in June 2016 and goes into effect in March 2018.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Even though the new MS4 general permit does not go into effect until March of 2018, there are things that must be done now. This summer (2017) municipalities must prepare pollution reduction plans (PRPs) and make these plans available for public review and comment. The PRPs assist MS4 municipalities to understand their obligations regarding &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; waters and must include the following:</div>

<ul>
	<li>A detailed map,</li>
	<li>An explanation of the current pollutant loads in local waterways,</li>
	<li>A description of best management practices (BMPs) to be implemented over the five year term of the permit and demonstration that these BMPs will reduce pollutants by specified amounts,</li>
	<li>A description of how the municipality expects to pay for implementation of their plan, and</li>
	<li>A description of the operation and maintenance of proposed BMPs.</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture will be reviewing and commenting on some of these MS4 PRPs this summer, but we need engagement from community members to ensure that stormwater doesn&rsquo;t harm our waters. </p>

Oil Trains and the Threat to Our Communities and Environment,7/6/2017,"<p>Oil trains are dangerous. On July 6, 2013 &ndash; exactly four years ago today - a runaway oil train brought tragedy and devastation to a community in in Lac-M&eacute;gantic, Quebec when it derailed and ignited 1.5 million gallons of crude oil, destroying buildings and ending the lives of 47 people.</p>

<p>On this four-year commemoration of that tragic event, trains continue to travel through Lac-M&eacute;gantic and many other communities, serving as a reminder of the risk we face when our reliance on dirty energy trumps the safety of our communities.</p>

<p>More than 700,000 Philadelphia residents (and more statewide) live in proximity to the rail routes that run crude oil near their yards, past their hospitals and childcare centers, and alongside their bike paths and highways. Trains carrying hazardous and highly flammable liquids even run alongside and cross our drinking water sources, even though the consequences of a spill or accident could impact the public health and safety of millions of people. In Pennsylvania, there is poor oversight of railroad bridges, a lack of transparency, and minimal access to rail maintenance records, along with insufficient penalties for regulatory violations.</p>

<p><strong>We cannot wait for another disaster to hit before taking action. </strong>We need stronger safeguards to protect our communities and our environment. As the federal government continues to pursue a regulatory reform agenda to &ldquo;alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens,&rdquo; (1) we will continue to see threats to our health, safety, and natural resources in the pursuit of dirty energy production. One of the first things we can do to come together to defend our communities is to speak up with them. Jeremy Griffin is one Philadelphia resident who has decided to do just that, and share his story on oil trains and the risks that we face.</p>

<p><strong>Here at PennFuture, we fight the big polluters and hazards that impact every community&rsquo;s access to clean water, clean air, and a safe environment.

Harrisburg Punts on Environmental Protection in the State Budget (Again),6/30/2017,"<div>At the 11th hour, the House, Senate, and Governor&rsquo;s office agreed to a General Appropriations budget for FY2017-18 that continues a funding crisis for environmental protection that started more than a decade ago.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The chief environmental protection agencies &ndash; Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) - have been systematically underfunded. Under the auspices of tough budget times and belt tightening, key programs have been cut or eliminated. Staffing has been reduced, putting public health at even greater risk. Yet, the environmental challenges impacting Pennsylvania continue to grow.</div>

<div></div>

<div><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-A-Primer-on-Pennsylvanias-Water-Crisis-Challenges-Impacting-Every-Community"">For example, the Commonwealth&rsquo;s water pollution challenges are growing in every corner of the state</a>, yet the DEP&rsquo;s Operational Budget, which supports water programs, was cut another 3.85 percent from the previous year. Since 2002-03, DEP&rsquo;s Operations Budget is down nearly 34 percent. Growing Greener investments through the Environmental Stewardship Fund have decreased by 75 percent. And the budget deal cut the critical water commissions, including the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC) and Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), by a whopping 50 percent.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>There is truly only one way to describe the overall budget deal: it&rsquo;s awful for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment.</strong> It ensures that the biggest challenges facing our public lands, water, air, and climate will not be addressed for at least another year, and probably longer.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Specifically, the following are some of the major concerns from the budget deal:</div>

<div></div>

<div><u><strong>Department of Environmental Protection</strong></u></div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The overall General Fund DEP budget ($147.72 million):</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>2.04% cut compared to the FY16-17 budget</li>
		<li>38.93% cut compared to the FY02-03 budget</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>DEP General Operations budget ($13.394 million):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>3.85% cut compared to the FY16-17 budget</li>
		<li>33.88% cut compared to the FY02-03 budget</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Water Commissions take a devastating budget cut:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>SRBC, DRBC, Rivermaster for the Delaware River, Interstate Commission for the Potomac River Basin, and Interstate Mining Commission all take a 50% cut compared to the FY16-17 budget</li>
		<li>Chesapeake Bay Commission budget held steady at $275,000</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</strong></u></p>

<p>The overall DCNR budget:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>6.29% cut in General Fund appropriations compared to the FY16-17 budget</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>7.8% cut in General Fund appropriations compared to the FY02-03 budget</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Budget deal shifts money from Oil and Gas Lease Fund</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The budget takes $50 million from the oil and gas royalties on state lands and provides it for General Operations</li>
		<li>It provides an additional $11.2 million from royalty revenue to the operations of State Parks and State Forests, which is an 83% reduction compared to the original House and Governor budget proposals</li>
		<li>The continued use of oil and gas royalty revenue for general operations raises questions due to the recent Supreme Court decision on interpreting Article 1, Section 27 of the state constitution.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Additionally, the budget deal does not include, at this time, the bond proposal introduced in the Governor&rsquo;s budget that would have increased DCNR&rsquo;s water program budgets significantly.</li>
</ul>

<div>For many of the issues impacting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment, the costs will only continue to increase the longer they go unabated. One only has to look at the decades of inaction around coal mining impacts on our waterways and the $15 billion liability to the Pennsylvania taxpayer currently estimated to clean up those culm piles and streams. We&rsquo;re making similar mistakes with Pennsylvania&rsquo;s drinking water, unconventional drilling, climate change, and air pollution challenges.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>State budgets are the ultimate reflection of policymaking priorities and for over a decade, environmental protection has been cut, and in many instances eviscerated. Our state priorities are out of whack and need to be changed before the problems become intractable and the harm to our citizens grows more severe.</strong></div>

Part II: A Primer on Pennsylvania’s Water Crisis - Solutions,6/28/2017,"<p><em>This is Part IIin a series providing a brief history of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s policy fight for clean water, a description of the water pollution challenges impacting Pennsylvanians, and the potential solutions toward providing clean water for all. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-A-Primer-on-Pennsylvanias-Water-Crisis-Challenges-Impacting-Every-Community"">Click here to read Part I.</a> For a deeper dive into our state&rsquo;s history of water pollution challenges, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Pennsylvanias-History-with-Water-Pollution-Policy"">click here.</a></em></p>

<p>Luzerne County communities are banding together to solve an expensive problem &ndash; uncontrolled stormwater pollution of local streams and the Susquehanna River. The substantial costs of installing stormwater controls, separating stormwater pipes from sewer pipes, and adopting the best ways to minimize stormwater pollution, like street sweeping, will be shared among 37 municipalities, lowering the expenses for the taxpayers. It will be funded by a stormwater fee assessed on each property of between $3.00 and $4.50 per month.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania&rsquo;s famously fractured local government system, it&rsquo;s a rare, great example of inter-governmental cooperation. You&rsquo;d think that the local officials involved would be boasting to taxpayers about how they can cooperatively clean up local waterways at reduced cost. Instead, they complained. One local official said, &ldquo;The public has to understand this is another unfunded mandate, and either their municipality is going to do it or the Wyoming Valley Sanitary Authority.&rdquo; This is simply not true.</p>

<p><strong>Clean Water is Not an Unfunded Mandate</strong></p>

<p>Clean water is not an unfunded mandate and this pervasive myth needs to end. Under Pennsylvania law and our state constitution, keeping our water clean is the responsibility of state and local government. Clean water is essential for health, industry and agriculture. But, let&rsquo;s be honest. Clean water is not free. It costs money to protect clean water, and it costs even more to clean up polluted water. That money has to come from somewhere. If we want clean water, we will have to pay for it.</p>

<p>The bad news is that the cleanup costs are daunting. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Susquehanna River/Chesapeake Bay cleanup - $647 million a year;</li>
	<li>Replace Pittsburgh&rsquo;s lead water pipes - $411 million;</li>
	<li>Clean up streams polluted by coal mining - $ 1 billion;</li>
	<li>Eliminate combined sewer overflows statewide - $28 billion.</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that, like the innovative, cooperative effort in Luzerne County and similar projects in other counties, including York and Lancaster, there are solutions that are ready to be implemented that minimize costs, and there are proposed solutions that would provide the resources to tackle our water protection and cleanup challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Investment is Critical</strong></p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s the duty of state and local governments to address water pollution challenges, the federal government also plays a role. In particular, the federal government has an obligation to address pollution challenges that cross state boundaries, such as those impacting many of our watersheds, through federal oversight and adequate funding.</p>

<p>Yet, federal policymakers have not made it easy on the states by continually cutting or underfunding key water pollution programs. For example, Congress must fully fund the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Chesapeake Bay Program. The EPA and Bay Program provide about $140 million a year to Pennsylvania farmers and municipalities to finance water pollution control projects. The Trump administration has proposed slashing the EPA budget by 30 percent and eliminating the Chesapeake Bay Program. These funding cuts would be devastating to the Susquehanna River cleanup effort, just as the federal Bay pollution limits are starting to show water quality improvements.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Congress could play a significant role in helping clean up acid mine drainage sites by passing the RECLAIM Act (H.R. 1731), which would accelerate the disbursement of $1 billion from the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund over five years. For Pennsylvania, this would mean more than $60 million in additional funding for mine reclamation each year for five years &ndash; an enormous increase in projects that would clean up water pollution as well as provide local economic benefits.</p>

<p><strong>State Policymakers Need to Aggressively Lead on Eliminating Water Pollution</strong></p>

<p>For its part, the Pennsylvania legislature has to really step up and lead. For too long, policymakers have cut water pollution programs &ndash; and environmental programs in general. As a result, water programs are run understaffed, without many inspectors, and little funds to provide reasonable oversight.</p>

<p>As such, state policymakers should increase funding to the Department of Environmental Protection so it has the resources to carry out its mission. DEP received $246 million in state funding in 2002. This year, the Governor&rsquo;s proposed budget earmarks only $152 million.</p>

<p>The House Budget bill (HB 218) calls for a 10 percent cut to general operations, which funds the agency&rsquo;s water pollution programs. Years of declining funding have left the agency woefully understaffed to the point where it cannot adequately review permit applications in a timely manner or do the number of inspections of drinking water treatment, wastewater treatment and agricultural operations to ensure compliance with pollution control laws.</p>

<p>But, state lawmakers shouldn&rsquo;t stop at simply making DEP&rsquo;s budget whole again. They should also provide more funding for clean water projects across the Commonwealth through dedicated revenue streams, including those to address pollution problems in the Susquehanna River watershed as well as lead, pharmaceutical, and PFOA pollution issues. For example, Governor Wolf&rsquo;s proposed budget once again included levying a severance tax on Marcellus shale gas drilling - a 6.5 percent tax on gas production would bring about $293 million into state coffers rising to about $500 million by 2020. A portion of that should be dedicated to water pollution control.</p>

<p>Another way to fund water projects is through a water user fee. Rep. Mike Sturla (D-Lancaster) has introduced legislation to enact a fee on water users that use more than 10,000 gallons of water per day to create a Clean Water Fund. Such a fee would generate about $245 million a year for clean water projects. Earlier this year, Pennsylvania legislators who are members of the Chesapeake Bay Commission endorsed the concept in a letter to other members of the Pennsylvania House and Senate.</p>

<p>The General Assembly should also renew the Growing Greener program, which provides grants directly to municipalities, restoration organizations and farmers to do local water quality protection and cleanup projects. Since the $625 million Growing Greener II bond was overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2005, funding for Growing Greener has declined by 75 percent. The Growing Greener Coalition has identified the need for $315 million a year for farmland, open space protection, and water restoration and protection projects.</p>

<p><strong>Local Governments Should View Water Pollution as a Central Challenge</strong></p>

<p>Finally, local governments should adopt policies and implement projects to control polluted runoff, which would in turn help guide farmers who need more information and assistance in complying with pollution control laws and adopting agricultural practices that minimize pollution.</p>

<p>Municipalities can adopt ordinances that require developers to maintain a vegetated setback from streams for residential and commercial developments. They can also participate in joint projects like the ones in Luzerne, Lancaster and York counties to control pollution in a cost-effective manner and further minimize cost by including &ldquo;green infrastructure&rdquo; like rain gardens and constructed wetlands to hold back and filter polluted stormwater. Municipalities can finance clean water projects by charging fees on properties based on the amount of impervious surfaces the properties contain, thus scaling funding to the amount of polluted waters a property creates.</p>

<p>Farmers can adopt a whole range of water-friendly practices such as limiting their use of fertilizers and manure to the amount needed to produce abundant crops, limiting their disturbance of soil when preparing fields, and installing forested buffers between their fields and streams.</p>

<p>The solutions to our water quality problems are there, though they&rsquo;re certainly not easy. Nonetheless, if we want clean water, we must insist that our federal, state and local officials provide the policies, incentives and resources to get the job done.</p>

<p>All of us must understand that clean water is not free, and we all must be willing to pay our fair share to ensure that our families and our communities can depend on the safety of the water flowing in our streams and coming out of our taps.</p>

Part I: A Primer on Pennsylvania’s Water Crisis - Challenges Impacting Every Community,6/27/2017,"<p><strong><em>This primer is Part 1 in a two part series, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Pennsylvanias-History-with-Water-Pollution-Policy"">with a sidebar providing a brief history of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s policy fight for clean water,</a> a description of the water pollution challenges impacting Pennsylvanians, and the potential solutions toward providing clean water for all. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Pennsylvanias-History-with-Water-Pollution-Policy"">For a deeper dive into our state&rsquo;s storied water pollution policy history, click here.</a></em></strong></p>

<p>When astronomers discover planets orbiting far-off stars, they assess whether or not that world could support life by determining if water is present. Their assumption, based on our own experience here on Earth, is that water is the basis of all life. It is our most precious natural resource. It is our most visceral connection to the natural world.</p>

<p>Yet, one of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s great historic struggles is providing every citizen access to clean water for drinking, recreation, farming, and industry. It&rsquo;s an unfortunate story of the Commonwealth turning a blind eye to pollution for the benefit of industry, failing to lead in times of crisis, and ignoring water pollution problems for so long, they&rsquo;re almost intractable.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say Pennsylvania hasn&rsquo;t had successes. For more than a century, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s communities and policymakers have worked to clean up our streams and rivers, resulting in significant policy wins and strong regulations. But the struggle for clean water continues today in every county, municipality, and city.</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Growing Water Crisis</strong></p>

<p>This century-long history of working towards policy that protects our waterways from pollution while we also invest in the restoration of our waterways has shown much progress. Culm piles have been reclaimed, many industrial discharges have been reduced, and billions of dollars have been invested in wastewater treatment, sewage systems, and stormwater controls.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Pennsylvania is facing a growing water crisis from a mix of legacy water pollution sources and emerging pollutants and industrial activity. From lead-contaminated drinking water in Pittsburgh, to sick and dying fish in the Susquehanna, to rainwater runoff contaminated with industrial pollutants in the Delaware, our rivers and streams are stressed and overburdened, with many showing signs of ecological decline.</p>

<p>In fact, after a century of water pollution policies, more than 20,000 miles of Commonwealth streams still fail to meet the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s goals of being fishable and swimmable. There remains up to $15 billion in acid mine drainage cleanup across the state. It&rsquo;s estimated that there are more than 200,000 orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells, potentially contaminating ground water. Pennsylvania has significantly failed to meet its pollution reduction goals set by the EPA in the Susquehanna River watershed, with more than 70 percent of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s farmers in the watershed failing to meet basic pollution-reduction planning requirements.</p>

<p>The toughest pollution problems remain, and they grow by the day. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no single villain. All of us contribute to water pollution. We&rsquo;ve neglected our drinking water pipes, paved over our watersheds, loaded tons of manure and fertilizer on our farm fields, allowed pollution laws to go unenforced, allowed new industries like unconventional gas drilling to go under-regulated, failed to prevent development on tree-lined stream banks, failed to eliminate acid mine drainage, dumped pharmaceuticals down the toilet or in our streams?, and starved the government agencies charged with protecting our water of adequate financial, technical and professional resources. Pollution problemsare widespread and expensive to address.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges Impacting Our Major Watersheds</strong></p>

<p>All of our great river basins, the Allegheny, Delaware, Susquehanna, and Lake Erie, face similar threats. Old sewer pipes throughout Pennsylvania cities carry both stormwater and sewage, and when it rains, raw sewage ends up in the citys&rsquo; rivers. As a result, places like the lower Delaware River and its estuary are contaminated with toxic chemicals. The river has a temporary reprieve from further damage through a &ldquo;moratorium&rdquo; on gas drilling currently in place through the Delaware River Basin Commission, and the horror of the so-called Energy Hub at the Port of Philadelphia seems stopped for now. But both defenses can change at any moment.</p>

<p>There is no better example of the monumental challenges we face in the work to reduce water pollution in all of our rivers than the Susquehanna River. The Susquehanna watershed drains rainwater that falls on 27,500 square miles of Pennsylvania cities, suburbs, highways, forests and farms, and receives wastewater from thousands of municipal and industrial treatment plants. Ultimately, these pollutants are harming fish and wildlife, reducing recreational opportunities, and making their way into the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>For example, the middle and lower parts of the river were once renowned for its bass fishery, which attracted anglers from near and far. But beginning in 2005, the bass population began to crash. Young fish were not surviving and many that did were sick and dying. Adult fish reproductive systems showed characteristics of both sexes.<br />
Several years of study turned up few surprises. The river is polluted with nutrients, sediment, agricultural chemicals and drugs. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, angler organizations and environmental groups formally asked the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to declare the river &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; so that a specific cleanup plan could be developed to reduce the pollution. DEP issued a very limited impairment determination for only four miles of the river that did not address the major sources of the river&rsquo;s pollution.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is also legally required by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to meet specific reductions of nutrient and sediment pollution going into the Susquehanna under the Chesapeake Bay cleanup plan. By far, the largest source of nutrient pollution - nitrogen and phosphorous - and sediment pollution come from agriculture, and many agricultural operations have not invested in adequate pollution control practices.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pennsylvania is significantly behind in meeting the required pollution reductions, most of which must come from agriculture and local controls on stormwater runoff from developed areas. Recently, the EPA sent a letter to DEP warning the state that if it does not come up with an adequately funded, viable plan to meet the reduction goals, it will impose penalties and its own cleanup plan.</p>

<p>The EPA estimates that Pennsylvania will have to spend between $50 million and $80 million per year to help farmers reduce pollution and between $200 to $300 million per year overall to address these challenges. But Pennsylvania has actually reduced its spending on programs to aid farm pollution control by about $20 million since 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Can Pennsylvania Keep Drinking Water Safe?</strong></p>

<p>Nothing ties us more intimately to our water resources than the water that comes out of our taps. We expect that the water delivered to our homes by water companies and municipal water authorities will be safe for drinking. But increasingly, that expectation is not being met. Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Allentown, and other Pennsylvania towns and cities are grappling with lead-contaminated water caused by ancient lead-based water pipes.</p>

<p>Alarmingly, DEP&rsquo;s program to ensure safe drinking water is woefully understaffed. The program is so underfunded that the federal EPA notified Pennsylvania that the inability of inspectors to adequately oversee drinking water systems and enforce the law poses &ldquo;serious public health implications.&rdquo; An EPA review found that key information about lead and copper levels in drinking water systems was missing from DEP inspection files. The situation is so bad, that EPA threatened to take away the state&rsquo;s authority to run the clean drinking water program.</p>

<p>The situation is no better in places like Montgomery and Bucks Counties, where communities near military bases have been poisoned by Perfluorooctanoic Acids (PFOS and PFOA&rsquo;s), chemicals used in firefighting foams. The chemicals infiltrated water wells near the military bases the foams were used and have led to contamination levels up to 15 times the federal limit, which can cause cancer, liver disorders, and other life threatening diseases.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s first statewide policy for preventing water pollution was the Purity of Waters Act of 1905, which set the first limits on how much &ldquo;sewage&rdquo; could be placed into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways. Unfortunately, the law specifically exempted discharges from coal mines and tanneries, which were some of the largest water polluters in the state at the time and influential in state politics. In fact, the law was enacted only after an outbreak of typhoid fever.</p>

<p>As orange streams, black snow, and water pollution grew significantly, Pennsylvania enacted the Clean Streams Law of 1937, which expanded penalties on polluters and strengthened discharge limits. Unfortunately, the law did not require polluters to restore degraded waterways and it continued exempting discharges from coal mines until &ldquo;practical means for the removal of the polluting properties shall become known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Clean Streams Law was significantly amended in 1945 to include coal mine discharges under the regulations and penalties, as well as require industry to develop and implement a plan for reducing pollution discharges. The Sanitary Water Board and Department of Mines were charged with enforcing these rules, though that enforcement was modest at best.</p>

<p>Yet, the Clean Streams Law was not wholly effective at the time. The number of polluted stream miles continued to increase and the state was incapable of keeping up with the industrial activity overwhelming our waterways. The Commonwealth began taking steps to turn the corner on its water crisis by amending the Clean Streams Law again in 1965 to require industries to restore degraded waterways as well as prevent their pollution. Regulations around discharges and in particular, coal mining, were significantly strengthened. Additional amendments in 1970 provided the Sanitary Water Board full regulatory authority over industrial activities that impact water.</p>

<p>During the 1960&rsquo;s, as more Americans became involved in environmental causes, Pennsylvania began investing in cleaning up water polluting sites, such as Project 70, which created the authority to issue bonds and utilize eminent domain to purchase open spaces for conservation reasons. This led to the creation of numerous state parks that protected not only land, but critical waterways as well. The Land and Water Conservation and Reclamation Act (Project 500) was enacted in 1968 to direct $200 million into abandoned mine reclamation, a lasting water pollution source after decades of mismanagement.</p>

<p>New federal environmental regulations, such as the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 and the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (otherwise known as the Clean Water Act) took the innovative step of providing a federal backstop to push states to strengthen their environmental policies. This led to Pennsylvania strengthening rules on drinking water, provisions for Lake Erie, new standards for wetlands, and strengthened permits for industrial activity.</p>

<p>The PA Department of Environmental Resources (DER) was also created in 1970 to provide additional capacity. And in 1971, Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly supported the ratification of Article 1, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution that states that people &ldquo;have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic values of the environment&rdquo; and the Commonwealth is a &ldquo;trustee of these resources&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1999, Pennsylvania passed the first Growing Greener legislation, which invested $650 million into land conservation and water pollution restoration projects. A second Growing Greener was enacted in 2005. The EPA implemented federal pollution restrictions on the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which includes Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Susquehanna River watershed, in 2010, which requires significant reductions in stormwater, agriculture, and industrial pollution.</p>

<p>But since Growing Greener, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s investment in water restoration has declined significantly and the states policy landscape has failed to keep up with emerging challenges, as Part 2 in this series will describe. Yet, while the future is uncertain, some progress continues. In 2017, the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court reinforced the central importance of Article 1, Section 27 and found that the Commonwealth must explicitly follow its explicit principles to, among other environmental rights, provide pure water.</p>

Protect Clean Water in the Keystone State,6/21/2017,"<p>We all depend on clean water. From communities in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that rely on public drinking water sources, to the 1.1 million anglers who cast their lines into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s streams each year, to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s craft brewers and paddlers exploring the Susquehanna, water is life.</p>

<p><strong>But the programs and policies that keep our waters clean to drink, fish, and swim are currently under attack by attempts to scale back and underfund them.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://protectcleanwater.org/""><strong>The Clean Water for All Campaign</strong></a> unites clean water stakeholders to defend and strengthen protections and funding for clean drinking water and healthy waterways in the United States. A key focus of our efforts is defending federal and state Clean Water Act-related programs that safeguard our nation&rsquo;s water.</p>

<p>Just in time for summer, the Trump Administration has taken several actions that threaten Pennsylvania&rsquo;s renowned trout streams, wetlands, and drinking water. The Administration has proposed deep cuts to critical Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Agriculture water programs that keep our water safe, and set in motion a process to roll back the very scope of the Clean Water Act itself.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, with its 86,000 stream miles and Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, and Delaware Basin watersheds, is uniquely situated to gain a multitude of clean water benefits from EPA programs and grants. Unfortunately, this means it has much to lose from the President&rsquo;s proposed fiscal year 2018 budget. The proposal eliminates regional ecosystem restoration programs that help states coordinate efforts to reduce pollution, restore fish and wildlife habitat, and safeguard drinking water in watersheds that cross state boundaries. This means that Pennsylvania would no longer receive federal funding via the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/great-lakes-funding/great-lakes-restoration-initiative-glri"">Great Lakes Restoration Initiative</a> and the <a href=""http://www.chesapeakebay.net/about"">Chesapeake Bay Program</a>, threatening ongoing efforts to improve the health of these watersheds.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania also receives EPA funding to help support water monitoring, assessment, and management through Clean Water Act <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/water-pollution-control-section-106-grants"">Section 106 grants</a>. In Pennsylvania, this program helps improve water quality in the Delaware River, Ohio River, Susquehanna River, and Potomac River and their many tributaries. Although federal investment is crucial to help Pennsylvania maintain water quality in the rivers and tributaries that provide the state&rsquo;s drinking water, the budget blueprint proposes to cut this program by one-third.</p>

<p>The budget also eliminates funding for state efforts to control and prevent nonpoint source pollution like agriculture runoff. In 2016, the EPA provided Pennsylvania with roughly $4.6 million for this through Clean Water Act <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/nps/319-grant-program-states-and-territories"">Section 319 grants.</a></p>

<p>Another target are Pennsylvania&rsquo;s small rural communities. The budget eliminates <a href=""https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/water-waste-disposal-loan-grant-program"">USDA&rsquo;s Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program</a>, which helps improve and maintain drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in rural areas. It also cuts the <a href=""https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/financial/eqip/"">Environmental Quality Incentives Program</a>, a USDA initiative that provides assistance to agricultural producers to develop and implement conservation practices on their farms.</p>

<p>We all know that water doesn&rsquo;t respect state boundaries, so without this federal investment it will be much more difficult for states to coordinate clean-up initiatives and it would cripple Pennsylvania&rsquo;s on-going and future efforts to protect its own waters from pollution.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has taken the first of two steps to <a href=""http://blog.nwf.org/2017/03/we-all-live-downstream/"">roll back Clean Water Act protections</a> for small streams and wetlands in Pennsylvania and nationwide. The Administration&rsquo;s first step is to repeal the widely-supported Clean Water Rule and replace it with a definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; that dramatically rolls back the historic scope of the Clean Water Act.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Education-Advocacy/Clean-Water-Rule_Factsheet_17-02_FINAL.ashx"">The 2015 Clean Water Rule</a> helps safeguard small streams and wetlands that flow downstream into larger, iconic waters like the Susquehanna. It restores Clean Water Act protections to headwater, rain-fed, and seasonal streams that serve as drinking water sources for nearly 2 in every 3 Pennsylvanians. It protects thousands of acres of wetlands that provide essential fish and wildlife habitat, including streams where Pennsylvania&rsquo;s native brook trout naturally reproduce, supporting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s $700 million freshwater fishing industry. Repealing this common-sense rule could put at least 59% of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s stream miles at greater risk from pollution and destruction.</p>

<p>Step two of this attack is replacing the Clean Water Rule with a new rule that would remove protections from waters that have been protected by the Clean Water Act for more than 40 years, relying on a legal test that the majority of the Supreme Court rejected. This rollback threatens clean water interests throughout Pennsylvania. The Administration&rsquo;s rollback plan provides very little opportunity for public input and contradicts the law and science that is the basis of the Clean Water Act successes since its inception. It also ignores the extensive public record in support of the Clean Water Rule; during the rulemaking process, EPA received more than a million public comments on the rule, 87% of which were supportive.</p>

<p>Whether for drinking, swimming, fishing, paddling, or brewing, we all need clean water. Tell EPA Administrator Pruitt and your members of Congress that you expect them to invest in clean water initiatives and defend the Clean Water Act. Please urge the Administration to withdraw its Clean Water rollback plan. If the Administration considers any potential revisions to the 2015 Clean Water Rule, they must engage in a thoughtful, inclusive, science-based, and legally sound process.</p>

Planning Ahead for Continued Restoration of Mine-Impacted Waters,6/20/2017,"<p>A hearing held on June 7 in Washington, D.C. provided an important reminder that protecting and restoring water resources often requires a long-term perspective, one that, in this instance, counsels for immediate action to ensure resources will continue to be available to address widespread and long-lasting sources of water pollution. </p>

<p><strong>The hearing before the House Natural Resources Committee&rsquo;s Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources addressed the federal Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program, which includes an AML Fund from which grants are distributed annually to states and tribes for reclaiming old abandoned coal mines.</strong> One issue addressed during the hearing was reauthorizing collection of the reclamation fee on each ton of extracted coal that supplies revenue to the federal AML Fund. Collection of the reclamation fee currently is scheduled to expire in 2021.</p>

<p><strong>The witnesses at the hearing included R. John Dawes, the Executive Director of the Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds and a former member of PennFuture&rsquo;s board of directors. </strong>Dawes was deeply involved in the negotiations resulting in the 2006 legislation that reauthorized collection of the reclamation fee through 2021. That work earned him a share of the Pennsylvania Abandoned Mine Reclamation Conference&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mayfly Award&rdquo; in 2007. Just last month, the Pennsylvania Environmental Council bestowed a Lifetime Achievement Award on Dawes in recognition of his decades of promoting mine drainage treatment and other watershed restoration projects. </p>

<p>For someone like Dawes, who regularly deals with perpetual discharges of mine drainage, a long-term perspective is second nature, and the work is never done. In the long view, 2021 is just around the corner, and it is high time to address what comes after &ndash; thus Dawes&rsquo;s trip to Capitol Hill earlier this month.</p>

<p><strong>The AML Fund is critical to restoring lands and waters in Pennsylvania that have been scarred by coal mining.</strong> Our state has received more than $1.2 billion in AML Fund grants since 1980, but estimates are that we will need more than $1 billion more just to reclaim those features that threaten public health and safety, such as cliff-like highwalls and barren, mountainous refuse piles. That restoration work often improves water quality by reducing or eliminating sources of silt and mine drainage that contaminate area streams.</p>

<p>Not all discharges of mine drainage, however, can be eliminated by reclaiming abandoned mine lands. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s past mining has left many abandoned discharges that require perpetual treatment to prevent continued pollution of our streams. Fortunately, a portion of each state&rsquo;s annual AML Fund grant may be used to treat these perpetual discharges. The Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has been at the forefront in using AML Funds to treat mine drainage discharges, setting aside $131 million from its annual AML Fund grants for that purpose since 1992.</p>

<p><strong>Nevertheless, abandoned mine drainage remains a predominant water pollution problem in Pennsylvania.</strong> It accounts for the impairment of about 5,600 miles of Pennsylvania streams, second only to agriculture among streams with an identified source of impairment. </p>

<p>Effectively restoring these impaired waters depends in part on the continued availability of money from the AML Fund, which often can be leveraged by matching it with grants from other government and private sources. The continued availability of the AML Fund, in turn, depends on extending the authorization to collect the reclamation fee past the current sunset date of 2021. </p>

<p>In his testimony to the subcommittee, Dawes recommended that Congress reauthorize the collection of the fee for another 15 years, through 2036, while maintaining certain important features of the AML program and making improvements to others.</p>

<p>Dawes also stressed the need for Congress to act as soon as possible. The long-term planning that is essential for effective land reclamation and mine drainage treatment projects is inhibited by uncertainty over the future availability of reclamation funding. The protracted negotiations over the last reauthorization created precisely this uncertainty. To avoid repeating that scenario, and to demonstrate a commitment to helping the communities hit hardest by the downturn in the coal mining industry, Dawes urged Congress to act well in advance of the 2021 sunset date: &ldquo;Congress needs to act now, and hopefully before the end of this Congress to reauthorize the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund fee collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture echoes this call for Congress to act now. </strong>Securing reauthorization of the AML Fund&rsquo;s reclamation fee is an essential component of any strategy for restoring and removing more streams from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s list of impaired waters. More generally, reauthorization of the reclamation fee is critical for revitalizing the communities that suffer the burdens of the landscapes and waters scarred by past mining practices. The nation as a whole benefitted from winning the world wars and the industrial and energy production fueled by the coal extracted from those now-abandoned mines, so it is appropriate for the nation to now help alleviate the environmental and social costs those abandoned mines continue to impose on coalfield communities. </p>

<p><strong><em>Reauthorization of the federal reclamation fee is one of many topics that will be addressed at the Pennsylvania Abandoned Mine Reclamation Conference June 21-22 in Wilkes-Barre. More information about that conference is available by <a href=""http://2017.treatminewater.com"">clicking here.</a></em></strong></p>

Lead in Our Drinking Water: Cause for Concern?,6/14/2017,"<p>The story is an old one. It began long before Flint, Michigan placed it into the national spotlight.</p>

<p>The story is one of lead pipes, which have been used in plumbing for centuries. Unfortunately, this is a tale that spans across the commonwealth, from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, and that story continues through many small towns across our country today.</p>

<p><strong>Health Impacts</strong></p>

<p>The science is clear; lead is a neurotoxin that impairs brain development and affects nearly every organ and system in the body. This is of particular concern for children, whose bodies absorb lead more quickly than adults. Children exposed to lead can experience behavior and learning problems, hearing complications, speech delays, anemia and kidney disease. Eighty-five percent or more of infant lead exposure that occurs during the first year of life comes from lead in water, through reconstituted formula.</p>

<p>Fetuses exposed to lead may be born early, have a low birth weight and experience negative health effects throughout their lives. Pregnant women are also especially vulnerable to lead exposure. A mother&rsquo;s past or present exposure to lead puts the unborn baby at risk.</p>

<p>In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stated, &ldquo;Even at half the levels previously considered safe, growing evidence shows a child&rsquo;s exposure to lead can cause irreversible cognitive and behavioral problems,&rdquo; and called for stricter regulations to protect children from lead poisoning. </p>

<p><strong>Regulations</strong></p>

<p>Under the federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), water authorities are required to act when their system-wide sampling exceeds 15 ppb (parts per billion) of lead in more than 10 percent of the homes in their sampling pool. This number is not linked to any health protection standard.</p>

<p>When municipal authorities exceed the action level, they quickly begin to offer free water testing kits. However, there is great variability with testing. A first draw sample may indicate five ppb one morning, while the next day it could indicate 50 ppb. If a resident&rsquo;s lead testing result indicates a number below 15 ppb, they should not conclude that they are &ldquo;safe&rdquo; from lead in water. The AAP urges legal requirements to ensure water fountains in schools do not exceed water lead concentrations of more than one part per billion.</p>

<p>Lead can be found in plumbing fixtures, fittings and solder. Until 2014, brass faucets advertised as lead-free could contain up to eight percent lead by weight. There is the potential of lead present all along the water&rsquo;s path, from street to faucet.</p>

<p><strong>Navigating the Path</strong></p>

<p>When local water authorities exceed the action level based on sampling, the LCR dictates that they must replace at least seven percent of the initial number of lead service lines in their distribution system annually. The LCR has created an invisible line, delineating ownership of the &ldquo;public&rdquo; side (water authority) versus the &ldquo;private&rdquo; side (homeowner) from curb to tap.</p>

<p>Water authorities will replace their public side of the lead service line, which is referred to as a partial line replacement. The homeowner must then decide whether it is financially feasible to replace her/his &ldquo;private&rdquo; portion of the lead service line.</p>

<p>This invisible line has nothing to do with protecting public health, which must be our first priority. Partial line replacements have been proven to increase the amount of lead exposure in drinking water. For cities that have conducted partial line replacements, the data shows this increased lead exposure may occur for days, months, and in some cases, years, due to physical and chemical disturbance.</p>

<p><strong>Local Action</strong></p>

<p>Many organizations across the commonwealth are working to address the lead in water crisis. Some are established environmental and health nonprofits, while others are community-based groups that formed in response to inaction and have led citizen-science initiatives.</p>

<p>Both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have created loan programs for residents who wish to replace their lead service lines, while both cities have embarked on education and outreach programs, and both are trying to identify where the lead service lines are located. One thing is clear: this is a problem that needs short-term strategies, long-term solutions, and a vision for a healthier community.</p>

<p>Our story will be complete when prevention is the priority and science guides all decision-making.</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>

<p>What you can do to protect yourself from lead exposure in drinking water:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://apps.npr.org/find-lead-pipes-in-your-home/en/#intro""><strong>Investigate your pipes</strong></a> to determine if you have a lead service line and test your drinking water for lead by contacting your local water authority.</li>
	<li>If testing is not available in your community, contact an accredited laboratory <a href=""http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/OtherPrograms/Labs/Pages/Laboratory-Accreditation-Program.aspx""><strong>(click here for a list)</strong></a> to request a test kit.</li>
	<li>Filter your water with an <a href=""http://www.nsf.org/newsroom/nsf-international-publishes-consumer-guide-to-nsf-certified-water-filtratio""><strong>NSF-certified system</strong></a> (water pitcher, faucet mount, or counter top unit that connects to your faucet). Home Depot and Target carry the PUR Faucet mounts and Zero Water pitchers; both remove lead from drinking water.</li>
	<li>Use a certified filter before you use water to prepare food and infant formula.</li>
	<li>Check your water filter cartridge and change it regularly. Clean aerators in all faucets weekly by rinsing the screen.</li>
	<li>Never boil water or use hot tap water to get rid of lead. Boiling evaporates some water, increasing the concentration of lead in the water.</li>
	<li>If you are concerned about lead exposure, ask your pediatrician to have your child&rsquo;s blood lead level tested. Early intervention has proven effective and is critical if lead levels are elevated.</li>
	<li>Advocate for policy change at the local, state and federal level, such as required testing for lead in drinking water in schools and early learning centers and banning partial line replacements.</li>

Supreme Court to Interpret Reach of the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law,6/13/2017,"<p>The Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, enacted in 1937, is the main law designed to protect our state&rsquo;s abundant fresh water resources &ndash; from fast rushing mountain streams, to slower flowing valley rivers, to underground water that navigates through cracks and spaces between rock and soil.</p>

<p>The Clean Streams Law sets forth the essential legal framework intended to &ldquo;preserve and improve the purity of the waters of the Commonwealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite its importance, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has issued but two decisions interpreting the liability provisions of the Clean Streams Law over the past 20 years. In 1998, the Court held in Adams Sanitation Co., Inc. v. Dept. of Envtl. Protection that the Department of Environmental Protection (Department) could, under Section 316, require an owner or lessor of land to correct pollution that existed on that land, regardless of whether the person caused or knew about the pollution. </p>

<p>Four years later, in Chalfont-New Britain Township Joint Sewage Authority v. Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority, the Court held that a county that allegedly contributed excess sewage to a joint treatment plant could be sued for discharging sewage indirectly into waters of the Commonwealth without a permit under Section 202 of the Clean Streams Law.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s only other Clean Streams Law decisions during that time concerned the statute&rsquo;s attorney fee provisions.</p>

<p><strong>Now, the Supreme Court is about to decide its third liability case in the past 20 years. In EQT v. Department of Environmental Protection, the Supreme Court will review a Commonwealth Court decision that limited the circumstances under which the Department of Environmental Protection could impose civil penalties on companies that unlawfully discharge industrial waste into waters of the Commonwealth.</strong></p>

<p>EQT owned and operated a gas well pad in Duncan Township, Tioga County at which it constructed an impoundment used to store contaminated wastewater from its fracking operations. Even though it was constructed with a synthetic liner, the wastewater impoundment leaked contaminated wastewater into area groundwater. </p>

<p>EQT eventually drained the impoundment, patched the leak, and removed contaminated soil from the site. It also took actions to intercept and collect polluted groundwater. The Department sought to impose a multi-million dollar civil penalty on EQT under Sections 301, 307 and 401 of the Clean Streams Law for contaminating the groundwater.</p>

<p>Sections 301 and 307 of the Clean Streams Law prohibit the discharge of industrial waste into waters of the Commonwealth. Section 401 makes it unlawful for any person to discharge from property owned or occupied by them &ldquo;any substance of any kind&rdquo; that results in pollution of waters of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Before Commonwealth Court, EQT argued that a violation of the Cleans Streams Law occurs only on the days when industrial waste is initially introduced into the waters of the Commonwealth, and that there is no violation for days that the pollutant, &ldquo;continues to be present.&rdquo; The Department argued that waters of the Commonwealth are made up of distinct parts &ndash; such as surface water and groundwater &ndash; and that separate violations of the law occur as the industrial waste enters and pollutes these distinct parts.</p>

<p><strong>The Commonwealth Court accepted the company&rsquo;s interpretation rather than that offered by the Department, holding that that Sections 301 and 307 are violated only when industrial waste initially enters a water of the Commonwealth. </strong></p>

<p>The Court also held that the release of industrial waste to the groundwater did not violate Section 401 of the Clean Streams Law, because that provision&rsquo;s prohibition on discharging &ldquo;any substance of any kind causing pollution&rdquo; was intended to cover pollutants other than the industrial waste regulated under Sections 301 and 307. </p>

<p><strong>The Department then appealed the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s decision to the Supreme Court.</strong></p>

<p>Because of the import of the case, PennFuture filed a friend-of-the-court (or amicus brief) in support of an interpretation of the Clean Streams Law that provides the agency with broad authority to impose substantial penalties when a company engages in conduct that causes widespread pollution to waters of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The submission of briefs is expected to conclude this summer. The Supreme Court will then schedule oral argument in the case, after which it will render a decision. There is, however, no deadline by which a decision must be issued.</p>

Protecting the Mighty Susquehanna,6/7/2017,"<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-June-Water-is-Life-Month-at-PennFuture""><strong><em>Water is Life Month</em></strong></a> is the perfect theme for reminding ourselves that all Pennsylvanians are guaranteed a right to clean water by Article 1, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Most importantly, it is the duty of the three branches of our Commonwealth government to conserve the quality and maintain the quantity of our water for the benefit of all people, including generations yet to come.<br />
. <br />
<strong><em>&ldquo;In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed and the first of that which comes - so with present time.&rdquo; &mdash; Leonardo da Vinci (1452 &ndash; 1519).</em></strong></p>

<p>&quot;Susquehanna&quot; comes from the Lenapi Indian term meaning, &quot;Oyster River.&quot; Oyster beds were widespread in the bay near the mouth of the river, where it entered the Chesapeake Bay. At 464 miles long, it is the longest river on the American east coast that drains into the Atlantic Ocean, and is the 16th-largest river in the United States. The Susquehanna River is one of the oldest existing rivers in the world, being dated as 320-340 Mya, older than the mountain ridges which it dissects.</p>

<p><em><strong>&quot;A river is more than an amenity&mdash;it is a treasure that offers a necessity of life that must be rationed among those who have the power over it.&rdquo; &mdash; Oliver Wendell Holmes (1841 &ndash; 1935), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, speaking about the Delaware River in 1931.</strong></em></p>

<p>The PA Fish Commission was created in 1866 to solve the problems caused by dams blocking the free migration of American shad in the Susquehanna River, and water pollution from logging filling our streams and rivers with sediment.In 1867, the first fishway was constructed at the Columbia (Wrightsville) Dam (built in 1840) as the first attempt to restore anadromous fish runs to the Susquehanna. Then, along came the York Haven (1904), Holtwood (1910), Conowingo (1929), and Safe Harbor (1931) hydroelectric dams, which continue to be major impediments to migratory fish since they were built. Unfortunately, not much progress has been made in restoring migratory shad runs to most eastern rivers, but PFBC staff remain committed to achieving the migratory fish restoration goals of two million American shad and five million river herring spawning upstream of the York Haven Dam.</p>

<p><em><strong>&ldquo;We abuse land because we view it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect.&rdquo; &mdash; Aldo Leopold (1887 -1948), A Sand County Almanac.</strong></em></p>

<p>Lesions and sores caused by bacterial infections appeared on young-of-year (YOY) smallmouth bass collected from the Susquehanna River in 2005. The disease symptoms produced a massive fish kill that still affects the fishery today. The average catch rate of adult smallmouth bass is only 20 percent of what it was prior to 2005. YOY smallmouth bass catch rates are 1/3 of what they were prior to 2002. Adult bass have been found with cancerous tumors, open sores, and lesions. Black spots that aren&rsquo;t totally understood (blotchy bass syndrome), as well as high rates of intersex conditions (male bass with egg precursors and hormones, which should be found only in female bass) caused by exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) now occur. These chemicals are coming from sewage treatment plant outfalls and other sources. Unprecedented algae blooms fueled by excessive dissolved phosphorus, along with low dissolved oxygen and high pH conditions, are all factors in this complicated problem.</p>

<p><em><strong>&quot;Water is the most critical resource issue of our lifetime and our childrens lifetime. The health of our waters is the principal measure of how we live on the land.&quot;&mdash; Luna Leopold (1915 &ndash; 2006).</strong></em></p>

<p>I have published a number of <a href=""http://www.fishandboat.com/Zone1/Pages/StraightTalk.aspx""><strong>Straight Talk articles in the Pennsylvania Angler and Boater magazine</strong></a>discussing the reasons why we need to begin taking action now before it is too late. Beginning with The Last Bass and Through the Eyes of a Child (2012), to S.O.S. (2015), Fear of the Known (2016) and The Precautionary Principle (2017), I discuss the ecological impacts of nutrients, EDCs and herbicides coming off of our land. Despite some moderate improvements to bass populations from several successful spawns, I continue to advocate the urgent need to create a plan (Total Maximum Daily Load) for the Susquehanna at the watershed scale, much like we have for the Chesapeake Bay, Lake Erie and other waters across our country.Why? Because our bass and oysters are depending on it, our anglers expect it, and Article 1 Section 27 of our Pennsylvania Constitution requires it.</p>

<p><em><strong>&ldquo;In an age when man has forgotten his origins and is blind even to his most essential needs for survival, water along with other resources has become the victim of his indifference.&rdquo;&mdash; Rachel Carson (1907 &ndash; 1964)</strong></em></p>

Water is Life: Celebrating Chesapeake Bay Week,6/6/2017,"<p><em><strong>This blog is one in a series of posts during PennFutures Water is Life Month, which explores Pennsylvanias water crisis.</strong></em></p>

<p>Monday marked the beginning of Chesapeake Bay Awareness Week, and in Pennsylvania, we celebrate and reflect on the critical health and importance of our local streams, creeks, and rivers, and the important role they each play in our lives.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that the health of the Chesapeake Bay is making modest improvements, but it&rsquo;s Pennsylvania&rsquo;s turn to dig-in and show everyone how essential our water is to our everyday lives and why the diminishment we are seeing in local water quality cannot continue to worsen. The situation continues to be challenging, and stakes are high. </p>

<p>We need to turn our focus to making healthy again the Chiques, the Conewago, the Conestoga, the Little Juniata, the Buffalo, and the Conococheague. We need to stand strong in preserving our natural heritage through angling and outdoor recreation enjoyed at Beech Creek, the Falling Spring, and the Yellow Breeches.</p>

<p>From drinking clean water in Harrisburg and Wilkes-Barre, to using clean water for agriculture in Lancaster County, to swimming in a watering hole in Franklin County, to paddling through the West Branch Susquehanna and our headwaters communities in the Wilds &ndash; Pennsylvanians know that protecting and restoring our water is essential.</p>

<p>This year brings an elevated purpose and role for clean water advocates and those who work in conserving our Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters. As a part of the Total Maximum Daily Load &ndash;the &ldquo;pollution diet&rdquo; -- set forth by the federal government in 2010 to improve water quality in Chesapeake Bay, 2017 brings the midpoint assessment to see where Pennsylvania is in meeting its pollution reduction goals by 2025 in sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous. Pennsylvania has missed its pollution reduction targets. We have decreased phosphorus pollution somewhat, but are missing nitrogen reduction significantly, putting the water we drink at risk throughout the basin, subjecting it to increased likelihood of algal blooms and other consequences. </p>

<p>Over the next 18 months, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Department of Agriculture are working in tandem to write the next in the series of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s goal documents in reaching its pollution reduction goals &ndash; the Watershed Implementation Plans, or WIPs.</p>

<p>Key agencies including the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and EPA&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Program are making strides in capturing monitoring data and collecting new information on our watersheds, with help from integral partnerships with colleges and universities, nongovernmental organizations, and local watershed associations. It takes a strong and well-oiled team to do this work. While Pennsylvania is far off-target for its 2025 goals, we can be heartened by new energy by stakeholders working on the third phase of the state&rsquo;s Watershed Implementation Plan.</p>

<p>Now more than ever, it is of paramount importance that our partners in recreation, sustainable agriculture, faith communities, education, and environmental conservation stand together and hold fast for the stewardship of our land and waters. We must remain engaged and push for more citizen stakeholders and advocates to remind our agencies about the severity of our clean water crisis in Pennsylvania and the need to uphold strong clean-up commitments.</p>

<p><strong>One way everyday Pennsylvanians can help this effort is to <a href=""http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol47/47-22/936.html"">submit public comments</a> to help develop the state plan to improve local water health in Chesapeake Bay Watershed counties until July 7.</strong> Citizens, farmers, paddlers, and advocates of all kinds are encouraged to lean in and tell DEP specifically how their lives revolve around water and how crucial clean water is.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the path forward to clean water in Pennsylvania doesn&rsquo;t stop with having good plans in place. Long-needed dedicated clean water funding legislation has been difficult to establish in our General Assembly and State Senate, though the Commonwealth is charged as a trustee of our water resources, and clean water is a guaranteedright under our state constitution. <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-State-Budget-Negotiations-are-Poison-Pill-for-PAs-Environment""><strong>Governor Wolf&rsquo;s budget continues the status quo.</strong></a> Even more alarming, $73 million in funding at the federal level through the EPA&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Program remain threatened due to President Trump&rsquo;s proposed FY18 budget.</p>

<p>Valuable conservation dollars spent for agricultural best management practice implementation by local farmers are paying off. This federal funding will be cut, or totally eliminated, as will money that flows to PA counties for conservation district staffs to work on water quality improvement, stewardship, and restoration projects. Work to establish forested riparian buffers and green infrastructure in our urban areas will suffer. Technical assistance to municipalities for stormwater requirement compliance to protect our waterways from run-off is also at stake. As Penn State found late last year, Pennsylvania needs about $300 million annually to meet its pollution reduction goals and to clean up its streams, creeks, and rivers.</p>

<p>This challenge may seem formidable, but PennFuture is working hard to defend clean water policy and funding, and working with the legislature and Governor to sufficiently fund clean water. As the state lead organization for the <a href=""http://www.choosecleanwater.org""><strong>Choose Clean Water Coalition</strong></a>, we are busy coordinating with partners and working with legislators in Harrisburg to pass newly introduced Growing Greener III legislation, a water usage fee to raise money for watershed restoration from waterway withdrawals, and a suite of legislation to support sustainable agriculture and a cut-back on nutrients, including Representative Mike Sturla&rsquo;s Clean and Green bill, in addition to a bill that would reduce nitrogen and phosphorous in homeowner&rsquo;s fertilizer bags. We have ramped up our outreach to partners in agriculture and are asking the tough questions. At the federal level, we are regularly advocating with Pennsylvania&rsquo;s congressional delegation for more conservation funding through upcoming infrastructure spending, the 2018 Farm Bill, the Chesapeake Bay Program, and pass-through and stewardship project grants from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. <strong>We believe in clean water policy and that water is a human right for all.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The importance of state and federal funding for clean water cannot be emphasized enough. Pennsylvania needs strong support from Washington, but it is past time the state legislature move on legislation that enacts a dedicated fund for clean water.</strong></p>

<p>We at PennFuture remain vigilant and steadfast in our support for clean water funding and conservation practices, but we need your help. <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/take-action""><strong>Join our mailing list</strong></a>, participate in action alerts by contacting your legislators at critical times, and join this fight.

<p><strong>Today, PennFuture is launching Water is Life Month to focus on the causes and solutions to our critical water problems.</strong> As legislators enter into budget negotiations, we need to remind them that they have an absolute duty under our state constitution to ensure Pennsylvanians have access to clean water. <strong>We must demand that they do their jobs</strong> and provide the funding necessary for our state and local governments to address the pollution contaminating our water and protect water that is clean.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s majestic watersheds &ndash; the Delaware, Susquehanna and Allegheny &ndash; lace together our landscapes and communities. Their world-class tributaries, like Spruce Creek, Letort Spring Run and the Yellow Breeches Creek, draw anglers from all over the world. Paddlers test their whitewater skills on the Youghioghenyand the Lehigh. French Creek, a tributary of the Allegheny River in Western Pennsylvania, is the most ecologically significant stream east of the Mississippi River, as its clear waters harbor 29 different species of freshwater mussels and 80 species of fish.</p>

<p><strong>Water is life. It&rsquo;s that simple. </strong>Over the course of the next month, PennFuture and guest writers will focus on the key water issues facing Pennsylvania, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Trump administration and Scott Pruitt&rsquo;s Environmental Protection Agency attack on clean water laws;</li>
	<li>Susquehanna River water quality and Chesapeake Bay restoration;</li>
	<li>The path forward for clean water in the Delaware River;</li>

Meet the Donor: Gail K. Neustadt,5/25/2017,"<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/Gailweb%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 221px; height: 330px;"" /></p>

<p>Do you ever get the feeling that someone is tapping on your shoulder, giving you that sense of urgency that there&rsquo;s something more you have to do? You turn around. There&rsquo;s no one there.But you felt that touch.It&rsquo;s like a wake-up call. Gail K. Neustadt, author, speech therapist, longtime PennFuture supporter and member of PennFuture&rsquo;s newly formed President&rsquo;s Leadership Council, insists we have done that to her!</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t know it then, but when she was growing up as a young girl on the west side of Cleveland near Lake Erie, Gail was already taking steps towards her future role in helping to preserve and protect Mother Earth. Gail loved to garden with her dad, and along with her two other siblings, took hikes in Metro Park. Her father was very adventurous, a former Eagle scout and guide, paratrooper and decorated WWII Major who&rsquo;d been awarded both a Purple Heart and Silver Star. Her mother was a community leader active in many women&rsquo;s organizations. She says both her parents were strong, positive influences, teaching her to, &ldquo;love and respect both nature and animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked her about the first time she became aware of environmental issues, and she told me that it started when she was about 5 years old. As her mom pulled into a gas station and asked the attendant to fill up the tank, Gail asked her mom about fuel. Her mother explained that gas allowed the car to move, explaining that it is food for the vehicle. Gail then asked her mother, &ldquo;Where does it come from?&rdquo; to which she answered, &ldquo;The ground.&rdquo; Since then, Gail has always looked to the earth as Mother Earth&mdash;&ldquo;everybody&rsquo;s mother from whence everything came.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
As she grew up, she remembers the scents and odors in her community due to pollution. Lake Erie was an absolute mess. She would be overwhelmed by the smell of rotten eggs and ask her mother about it, who would tell her: &ldquo;You are smelling the industrialization of the Flats along the Cuyahoga River.&rdquo; Gail&rsquo;s father always wanted his children to learn more. There were tours for the River and Lake Erie so they could see firsthand what was happening.</p>

<p>College opened Gail&rsquo;s eyes to many social justice issues, and she actually took classes with renowned child expert, Dr. Benjamin Spock. At the University of Wisconsin , everyone was very involved in the anti-war movement and she remembers that her rabbi marched with Martin Luther King. </p>

<p>Later, when she was married and starting her family, she and her husband moved to Upper St. Clair. She particularly remembers Cook School Road, where there were so many farms with blackberry bushes and wildflowers.She and her children would take walks, enjoying the lush scenery, picking blackberries for pie. But before long, she saw that the farms were being sold off so developers could build large homes.</p>

<p>As the big earth movers and trucks came in to clear the land to build those homes, Gail witnessed the diesel engine emissions hurting the fragile blackberry bushes, the cornflowers and other wildflowers. In her mind, the diesel trucks were the enemy as she loved the flowers and felt a kinship with them. She also noticed a similar scent&mdash;that awful choking smell that she smelled as a kid that made her nauseous. &ldquo;Look what these emissions are doing to the poor flowers.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<strong>What brought her to Presto?</strong><br />
<br />
Gail moved to Presto 15 years ago to accommodate her husband&rsquo;s illness. She created a very involved garden for him and during this time, she was a speech therapist and had a qualified nursing home administrative license. Gail worked on a multi-state casements project that established the current payment and assurance programs -still used in Medicare now.After her husband David was diagnosed with Alzheimers, Gail began to feel that what was happening to him, along with the rise of so many diseases, like autism, allergies, and heart conditions, were connected. Our environment was being polluted, as were we. She began writing her children&rsquo;s book, Sebastian&rsquo;s Tale, in which the hero is a skunk leading other animals against the land developers who are hurting the earth. Those developers and their machinery needed more energy and gas to build their McMansions, all the while destroying wildlife and their habitats.<br />
<br />
Nine years ago, PennFuture was involved in a large convention at the Nittany Lion Inn at Penn State University to educate the public about the Marcellus Shale. Nearly1,000 people attended, from politicians, to hunters and fisherman, to average folks. Gail could not believe what could be coming to her home. People from Hickory (the first area in the state to be heavily fracked) talked about how sick they were since fracking began, and they talked about the smells.Gail was brought back to the early days of Lake Erie and that trip to the gas station as a youngster.<br />
<br />
In addition to writing her children&rsquo;s book and fighting fracking, Gailjoined the board of the nearby park and the local commissioners&rsquo; advisory team, Friends of Collier Park, and helped raise money for land preservation.<br />
<br />
<strong>What made her decide to support PennFuture? </strong></p>

<p>She says after that gathering at Penn State, she was grateful that we taught her more about energy issues; that we helped point her in the direction to learn more about ecology and what being &ldquo;green&rdquo; really means. Gail insists PennFuture was her wake up call to work hard for the environment. When we asked her to join the President&rsquo;s Leadership Council, she said we tapped her on her shoulder. We were her wake up call. She feels an urgent responsibility for herself, her family and her community to stand up for the preservation of our state, and our earth. <br />
<br />
Sometimes, Gail says, it&rsquo;s not easy to change people&rsquo;s minds, but keeping the conversation going is key. Her own Nevillewood Community Association is going solar.</p>

<p><strong>What does she love about PennFuture?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;The support PennFuture gives to communities under fire having difficulties, especially helping them legally, is very important. The information we get out and the programs we have for green efforts, plus our work to preserve our earth&mdash;pushing renewables and educating the public, is critical.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
As part of the PennFuture Leadership Council, she says: &ldquo;We are expected to help inform and educate others,&rdquo; and that fits into her own goals.</p>

<p>Thank you, Gail, for your leadership and support.</p>

A Climate of Conversation: Perspectives on Climate Change and Clean Energy,5/24/2017,"<p>I recently attended the &ldquo;Energy Evolution: 2017 Pittsburgh Energy Forum Series&rdquo; held at the Heinz History Center. This panel discussion was sponsored and presented by the <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> and Peoples Gas Company. I have been impressed by Morgan O&rsquo;Brian, Peoples president and CEO, as this particular gas company is seeking to have an honest dialogue about climate change and clean energy. I was also pleased that David Shribman, executive editor of the <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em>, moderated a revealing discussion called: &ldquo;A Climate of Conversation: Perspectives on Climate Change and Clean Energy.&quot;</p>

<p>The size of the public turnout was impressive and very encouraging. The conference center of the History Center was full, and the audience actively engaged with appropriate questions. Highlighting the panel was Michael Mann, Penn State University&rsquo;s distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science Center, whose now famous hockey stick warned of the impending non-linear climate change confronting the world.I was very pleased when Michael recently joined the board of directors of PennFuture as his knowledge and leadership will be invaluable to our cause.</p>

<p><strong>The underlying issue of the evening circled around the unstated question: in the face of a non-linear climate crisis, what does sustainability really look like?</strong></p>

<p>This was an evening with divergent perspectives on the matter for sure. On one hand, Michael painted a scientifically-sound picture of the stark realities of climate change, complete with the assertion that we need an aggressive clean energy program capable of cutting carbon emissions dramatically to avoid catastrophic climate change.</p>

<p>(On this point, the highly-regarded accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has been doing audits to measure progress. For the past several years, PWC has been running the numbers on climate change, and in 2014, warned that were 20 years away from catastrophe, making it clear that we need to cut global emissions by 6.2 percent to avoid the dreaded tipping point of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, the solutions were thin to non-existent. The stark contrast between the alarming threat of fast-approaching climate disruption and the profound lack of action could not be starker. While claiming to be a green city, Pittsburgh has failed to deploy truly clean energy. Apart from a handful of corporate leaders like Levin Furniture, PittOhio, PNC Bank, and scattered pioneers like Phipps Conservatory, the community of Millvale, and a few private solar powered homes in the city, we are lagging far behind what we need to be doing to avoid climate calamity. The black and gold city needs to be installing clean energy and cutting its carbon emissions by 6.2 percent per year and not just talking about being a green city.</p>

<p>I was particularly troubled by what one of the panelists, Ron Gdovic, CEO of WindStax Wind Power Systems, said about the solar industry. His lack of knowledge about concentrated solar and battery options were concerning. For reasons that escaped me, Gdovic took a shot at the solar industry, that has been experiencing massive growth around the world, but not in Pittsburgh and certainly not on Wall Street. In the clean energy mix of the future, there is room for solar, wind and for WindStax. The clean energy community needs to be united and not divisive. The fossil fuel industry would love to divide and conquer. Fortunately, the discussion turned back to Michael to conclude with his assessment of the future.</p>

<p>Whether we listened or not, Michael warned that there is much more change coming our way as we overrun numerous planetary boundaries. As Michael suggested, the Arctic deterioration is happening many years earlier than the IPCC scientists predicted, and sea-level predictions have been revised upward from the latest IPCC report.</p>

<p>(The Arctic is in massive positive feedback mode as the tundra is a net carbon producer now.The once frozen methane clathrates are releasing their potent greenhouse gases and the open waters of the Arctic are absorbing energy and feeding heat-trapping cloud formation. As the oceans warm, thermal expansion swells sea-level predictions. Greenland lost one trillion tons of ice in the past four years, and Antarctica is readying to shed an ice sheet the size of Delaware.)</p>

<p>Much remains to be done in Western Pennsylvania, but this was a good start to daylight the extraordinarily challenging days ahead. We need to listen to our top scientists like Michael Mann.</p>

<p>I hope this gathering can be a turning point. The <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> needs to dig deeper into the climate crisis to help its readers understand the enormous threat we face, and journalists must be unleashed to investigate the over-investments in the gas infrastructure by politicians.</p>

The State Budget Negotiations are Poison Pill for PA’s Environment,5/22/2017,"<p>Over the last 10 years, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s state budget has consistently put the environment and public health at risk.</p>

<p>Deep budget cuts and sneaky policy provisions have undermined the Commonwealth&rsquo;s ability to keep drinking water safe, hold polluters accountable, and provide a clean and healthy environment for all. The FY2017-18 budget negotiations look to make this bad situation even worse.</p>

<p>While the media and general public focus on top-line items, such as education funding, total government spending, debts, and deficits, the budget determines how much or how little investment goes into environmental protection. <a href=""http://www.pennlive.com/news/2017/03/drink_water_in_pennsylvania_tr.html""><strong>The state budget process ultimately allows legislators to determine how many inspectors the state has to oversee your drinking water.</strong></a></p>

<p>This process determines how often the state inspects drilling operations and determines which permits are issued for conducting industrial operations safely. It determines whether or not grants are provided to communities to support recycling, how much funding is given to maintain our state parks, and also determines which funds are given to support park and forest facilities.</p>

<p>The budget allows legislators to choose whether or not to invest in storm water buffers to keep pollution out of our streams, and in spraying to keep West Nile Virus and other insect borne diseases away from our families.</p>

<p>The budget process has the potential to allow the state to carve out resources that direct investment toward cleaning up the Susquehanna River and reclaiming old coal piles. It could help to protect where we fish, swim, hike, ATV, recreate, and live.</p>

<p><strong>The kicker: </strong>we depend on our elected officials to make good choices about the environment, and ultimately, it is up to them. The state budget process is one in which we could make great environmental strides by investing in public health. But it all depends on the priorities and the decisions made by Governors and legislators.</p>

<p><strong>Over 10 Years of State Budget Cuts to Environmental Protection</strong><br />
Unfortunately, for the last 10 years, governors and legislators have cut investment in environmental protection, making it increasingly difficult to provide even the most fundamental oversight.</p>

<p>From FY02-03 through FY16-17, state investment in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has been cut by 53 percent, adjusting for inflation. There has been a corresponding increase in federal grants to DEP of 14 percent, but it&rsquo;s nowhere near enough to make up for the cuts in state funds.</p>

<p>During the same time period, state investment in the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) has been cut by 24 percent, accounting for inflation. There has been a 65 percent increase in federal grants, but because the increase was starting from a very small base, the overall increase doesn&rsquo;t cover the cuts in the state share.</p>

<p>Making matters worse, both DEP and DCNR&rsquo;s budgets rely significantly on special spending accounts, separate from state appropriations, for between 30 to 70 percent of its overall budget. These funding accounts are where revenue from fees and fines are collected and directed by law to specific activities at the agency, such as oil and gas royalties from public lands, waste fees, and permitting fees.</p>

<p>In FY2016-17, both DEP and DCNR&rsquo;s overall budget relied on these funds for 42 percent of its revenue. Yet, the revenue provided from these funds has decreased by 26 percent at DEP and 18 percent at DCNR since FY 2002-03 because the legislature has diverted those funds to other programs, or the funds haven&rsquo;t been updated in years and are accruing less and less dollars every year.</p>

<p>What does all of this mean? Pennsylvania has consistently cut state funding for protecting our air, water, and public lands, while failing to update our laws to keep agency funding accounts up-to-date. This has led to a dereliction of duty. Our state government isn&rsquo;t provided the funding and tools to fulfill its mandate to protect our environment for present and future generations.</p>

<p><strong>The FY2017-18 State Budget Aims to Make a Bad Situation Worse</strong><br />
Pennsylvania&rsquo;s ability to protect the environment is nearing a moment of crisis, yet there is little urgency to address the problem through the state budget. In fact, the Governor proposed a state budget that continues the status quo, while the House of Representatives has passed House Bill 218, which makes environmental funding remarkably worse.</p>

<p>HB 218 is a disaster for DEP and DCNR. It proposes cutting DEP&rsquo;s General Operations by 10 percent, its Environmental Programs by 6.5 percent, and its Environmental Protection programs by five percent. It cuts all river basin commissions by up to 50 percent and hacks 8 percent from the Chesapeake Bay program. These cuts put DEP&rsquo;s ability to protect our water resources in a dire situation, while stressing its basic functions, like permit oversight, to a level never seen at the agency.</p>

<p>It also cuts DCNR&rsquo;s budget by $2.8 million, which would result in rolling closures of state parks, a lack of maintenance at public facilities, and the elimination of key programs that support trails, road maintenance for hunters at state forests, and programs that battle forest fires.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, PennFuture will keep a close eye on state budget negotiations and make sure that we keep you &ndash; our readers, members, and the general public &ndash; apprised of what the legislature is doing with your environmental protection agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Early indications aren&rsquo;t good and the public needs to tell their elected officials cutting DEP and DCNR is unacceptable. <a href=""http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/"">Click here to find and contact your legislator today.</a></strong></p>

How we choose to treat the environment has a direct impact on our lives, our public safety, and our health. Within President Trump&rsquo;s first 100 days, we have witnessed unprecedented attacks onour public health through executive orders, regulatory reform, and proposed budget cuts. The people of the United States have a right to a clean and healthy environment, and that right cannot come second to the interests of fossil fuel companies.I will not stand for it, and the people of Pennsylvania will not stand for it.</p>

<p>This is my first large climate march, and I&rsquo;m so proud that I worked with Conservation Voters of PA to organize a busload of Pennsylvanians to join more than 200,000 people marching in Washington, D.C. These are only the first 100 days of this Administration&rsquo;s irresponsible and extremely dangerous decision-making. We will be called to defend our health, our safety, and our values as a nation. I&rsquo;m proud that PennFuture is taking a stand and that we are working with our members to elevate their demands to their representatives and other key decision makers.</p>

I came for the simple reason that Donald Trump&rsquo;s policies are destroying the world I live in. Some examples include cutting funding to National Parks, wanting to open up National Monuments to drilling and mining, wanting to destroy&mdash;actually dismantle--the EPA entirely, relaxing pollution standards on coal companies, allowing them to pour poisons into streams, and on and on and on. And common sense says that&rsquo;s a kind of suicide.

Clean Energy Pittsburgh: Leading the Way,5/18/2017,"<p><em><a href=""http://pennfuture.org/News-Clean-Energy-Pittsburgh-Convenes-First-Community-Workshop"">The first ever Clean Energy Pittsburgh workshop</a> took place in Millvale, Pa. on Friday, May 12. Brittany Reno is one of the participants and a local leader who is passionate about moving her community towards clean energy. Clean Energy Pittsburgh is a PennFuture initiative funded by The Pittsburgh Foundation.</em></p>

<p>Clean energy is important to me because I represent a community that is facing substantial challenges around air quality and stormwater management, which is why I am enthusiastic to have the opportunity through PennFuture&rsquo;s Clean Energy Pittsburgh cohort to learn from the successes and challenges of similar communities at a crossroads.</p>

<p>Being nestled in a river valley between an active industrial railroad and a major highway, Sharpsburg often finds itself bearing the burdens of heavily polluted air and overwhelming stormwater flooding, and we&rsquo;re at a critical point where it&rsquo;s dangerous and impossible to continue ignoring the huge impact that we&rsquo;re having on our environment&mdash;and vice versa.</p>

<p>I represent Sharpsburg as both a borough council member and as the executive director of Sharpsburg Neighborhood Organization, a resident-driven community development nonprofit. In both of these roles, I advocate for community-supported local improvements that make the borough a safer and healthier place to live. It&rsquo;s especially important to me to advocate on behalf of stakeholders who aren&rsquo;t typically represented at local decision-making tables; I have found that the needs of children, people of all ages who are living in poverty, and the environment itself are generally under-represented in discussions around legislation and development.</p>

<p><strong>Clean energy and sustainable community planning are not just environmental issues; they&rsquo;re issues of public health, economic opportunity, and social equity.</strong> When the air breathed by people in low-income communities is filled with cancer-causing soot particulates, and those same people must bankrupt their families and futures to finance health care treatments to deal with these problems, it&rsquo;s clear that the issue of clean energy is a life or death matter, not a niche environmentalist issue.</p>

<p>My biggest takeaway from the first Clean Energy Pittsburgh workshop is that it&rsquo;s not enough to stand by and wait patiently for federal or state lawmakers to lead the way on saving our planet. In a time when big-money corporate interests have a stranglehold on our political process, I&rsquo;m convinced that the drive for widespread investment in clean energy will be most effective as a grassroots movement, an entire nation of small towns like mine filled with normal people like me rising up and demanding that we as a society do better for our children and grandchildren by doing what&rsquo;s in our power to protect and repair the environment. Our representatives need to start legislating based on the health and safety of the people and the environment, not the profits and bonuses of soulless, lungless corporations.</p>

<p><strong>I call on other community leaders to get involved at the local level because there is strength in numbers.</strong> Your impact as one community of 3,500 people will not save the world, but when we band together and galvanize individuals across the state and across the country to action, it sends a message that gets harder and harder to ignore at the state and federal levels. We deserve clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We should not get cancer from breathing the air around us, and our legislation should reflect that right. <strong>Your actions at the local level, multiplied in inspired towns across the country, truly do have the power to save the planet for those of us who live on it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We can win, so long as we care enough to work hard and fight fair. Let&rsquo;s get to work.</strong></p>

A Voice in Defense of Science,5/15/2017,"<p>We often take certain things for granted in life. One of those for me was the difference between personal opinions and scientifically verifiable facts. I never thought I would have to march to defend the very notion of science itself.</p>

<p>Like tens of thousands of others in many cities around the world, I marched with PennFuture&rsquo;s staff and 20,000 volunteers stretching across ten blocks across Center City Philadelphia during the March for Science on April 22. During this march, we gave support to the scientists who are under fire from dark-money contrarians, climate deniers, and even the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who himself rejects climate science, and our own president who thinks that climate change is a Chinese hoax.</p>

<p>We started at Philadelphia City Hall, which is crowned by a statute of one of America&rsquo;s earliest noted scientists, Ben Franklin. It was appropriate that a Franklin look-alike led our march as he was not just a founding statesman, inventor, and author of &ldquo;Poor Richards Almanack,&rdquo; but he also was one of America&rsquo;s first scientists. Among his scientific advancements, Franklin charted the powerful Gulf Stream that enabled ships sailing for Europe to double their speed.</p>

<p>Franklin also launched the American Philosophical Society in 1743 to pursue &quot;philosophical experiments that let light into the nature of things, tend to increase the power of man over matter, and multiply the conveniences or pleasures of life.&quot; Franklin knew that the advancement of science and the application of knowledge would greatly benefit society. He also believed that curiosity and experimentation would lead to greater light into the nature of things. </p>

<p>In a modern social system as in Franklin&rsquo;s day, certain principles and values are inherent to the proper functioning of community. Since the 18th century &ldquo;Age of Enlightenment,&rdquo; science-based decision-making has been central to nearly every societal advancement.</p>

<p>Science leads the world towards greater and greater progress, as we find new ways to tackle old problems. PennFuture shares Franklin&rsquo;s view of science, as we are an environmental organization committed to science-based advocacy for the advancement of a safe, healthy and sustainable society. We depend upon science to provide critical answers to the most vexing air and water pollution problems. Soil science properly applied yields greater productivity while retaining nutrients and sediments. Clean energy built on advancing technologies provides clean, carbon-free energy to meet the demands of a 21st century society.</p>

<p>The highly-respected astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said it best: &ldquo;The good thing about science is that its true whether or not you believe in it.&rdquo; Whether policymakers believe in science or not is irrelevant, facts are stubborn and cannot be just legislated away. Should society irrationally abandon authoritative science and turn once again to superstitions and myths, then we will certainly drift into the tyranny that created the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>Upon hearing that President Trump wants to cut climate science funding and dismantle EPA&rsquo;s science advisory group, the newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron says France wants our top climate and clean-tech researchers to move to his country, where they will be understood and respected. The French president knows that science and innovation will underpin the winning nations in the future as it has in the past.</p>

<p>Can we afford to lose our scientific edge and just ignore or discount the warnings of climate scientists? Can we simply publish textbooks that avoid objectionable scientific conclusions and pejoratively label innovators and leading thinkers as &ldquo;coastal elites?&rdquo; When a highly vocal chorus of ill-informed voters repeatedly reject basic truths and pursue myths and alternative facts concocted by those who obfuscate, we must ask, perhaps are we a society encountering the very boundaries of human enlightenment? I, for one, certainly hope not, but that is no longer a given.</p>

First Person: My Experience at the Harrisburg March,5/11/2017,"<p>On the date marking President Trump&rsquo;s first 100 days in office, PennFuture staff and members joined colleagues fromSierra Club - Pennsylvania Chapter and the Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg by marching for clean air, pure water, and a healthy climate. The president observed his first 100 days in office with a rally in our city, and we wanted to make it clear that climate change is real and it is an issue that must be addressed.</p>

<p>It was a warm and humid day, much like any summer day in Pennsylvania, but overcast, and our city was electric with anticipation. People from across the state and country descended upon the Capital City.</p>

<p>Upon learning that President Trump and Vice President Pence would be speaking at a rally at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex to tout victories and accomplishments of the administration, our environmental community banded together with other statewide and local community organizations in Harrisburg to stand up against the President&rsquo;s dangerous and damaging environmental policies.</p>

<p>While more than 200,000 of our neighbors and allies marched on Washington, D.C. during the People&rsquo;s Climate March, held on the same day, we decided to make a statement to President Trump that he could not take shelter in the Keystone State from listening to our voices and our earth. We aimed to bring the energy of the People&rsquo;s Climate March to Harrisburg and remind President Trump of his obligation to lead on environmental issues.</p>

<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/ezramarch%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 533px;"" /></p>

<p>During his first 100 days in office, President Trump dismantled hard-won climate protections, issued assaults on our air, water, and land, directly attacked the well-being of working families, and marginalized Indigenous communities, people of color, immigrants, the LGBTQIA community, women, young people, and low-income communities. Further, the President&rsquo;s policies have attacked national monuments and the Endangered Species Act, and put at risk key funding for our farmers and watermen through the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.</p>

<p>By any and all measurements, the first 100 days of the Trump Administration and the Scott Pruitt-led Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have completely failed when it comes to protecting our health and environment. In fact, virtually all of Trump&rsquo;s environmental actions have put public health at greater risk, exposing us to dangerous pollution from power plants, cars and other sources, and toxic chemicals in our water and pesticides on food kids like to eat.</p>

<p>President Trump and EPA Administrator Pruitt have also failed to push clean energy and the jobs that come with it. Their unprecedented actions that jeopardize the safety of Americans are squarely at odds with what, in poll after poll, the American people want: clean air and safe water, clean energy, action on climate, and for their government to hold polluters accountable.</p>

<p>Specifically in Pennsylvania, farmers&rsquo; crops are being hurt by the changing climate, outdoorsmen are encountering diseased game, fishermen are finding sick bass, public drinking water in a number of municipalities face lead contamination, and our cities are experiencing flooding and stormwater problems at new, out of control levels.<br />
We gathered around in the early evening among the state&rsquo;s towering administrative buildings to speak truth to power. After listening to uplifting speeches from friends, nearly 500 citizens marched up 7th Street to Maclay Street before moving over to Cameron Street by the Farm Show Complex. It was a beautiful evening as the sun set and we were met with the community support of honking cars and cheers as we passed by the different city neighborhoods.</p>

<p>As Vice President Pence left the event, we made sure to share our signs and chants with him, and we did the same as President Trump&rsquo;s motorcade left the location and pulled onto Cameron Street back to Washington. The evening put over six miles of trekking on the marchers, but seeds were planted, and an overwhelming spark of empowerment in our fellow marchers was evident. It resonated long after the night concluded.</p>

<p>We marched, because all Pennsylvanians deserve a voice. All Pennsylvanians, no matter their station, have a right to clean air, pure water, and the preservation of our environment. It is the duty of the Commonwealth to serve as trustee of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s precious resources for not just the rich, and not just the powerful, but for all. We must continue to advocate for conservation and our environment. <strong>We must continue to show up and share our stories, not only by marching in the streets, but by continuing our work in the halls of the State Capitol and in Washington.</strong></p>

Who will finally take action on PA’s worsening oil and gas air pollution problem?,5/4/2017,"<p><strong>(UPDATE: Our original data, obtained through a Right to Know request,showed a 20 percent year-over-year increase in methane emissions between 2014 and 2015. As of May 24, 2017 the PA DEP has released their reports and are now showing a 28 percentincrease year over year.)</strong></p>

<p>Every year since 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has asked drillers and owners of compressor stations to report the amount of air pollution they emit. We saw a dip in emissions of methane&mdash;the primary constituent of natural gas&mdash;in 2013 as a new set of regulations, the federal New Source Performance Standards, began to phase in, but emissions are once again on the rise.<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/NG_PROD_SUM_A_EPG0_FGS_MMCF_A.htm"">Data from the Energy Information Agency (EIA)</a> shows that natural gas production from such wells in Pennsylvania increased by more than 12 percent between 2014 and 2015. But the most recent inventory data shows that between 2014 and 2015, methane emissions rose more than 20 percent&mdash;an alarming increase. <strong>Any time emissions are rising faster than production, it&rsquo;s clear that voluntary efforts to cut emissions are not working.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is the industry emitting more now, or was it inappropriately under-reporting emissions in previous years?</strong>While both may be true, new reporting alone doesn&rsquo;t seem to be enough to explain the large jump in emissions. These inventories are industry&rsquo;s self-reported data, and as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has previously noted, actual emissions could be considerably higher than what is being reported. <a href=""http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2017/February/methane-increases-in-Marcellus-Shale/"">Recent studies in Pennsylvania have shown our local methane concentrations are increasing much faster than the global average.</a></p>

<p>Back in 2012, the largest source of methane emissions industry reported was well completions, or the process of readying a well for production. At the time, it was common practice to vent gas straight to the atmosphere. Thanks to new federal standards, operators must now capture that gas. As a result, well completion emissions dropped over 90 percent between 2012 and 2014 and that by itself explained a dip in total emissions. These sensible standards kept thousands of tons of methane from being emitted each year, but these emissions are now rising again as drilling increases.</p>

<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/graphicmethane%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 386px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>One of the key lessons we can draw from the data is that rules work, and Gov. Tom Wolf has the ability to act on behalf of Pennsylvanians and their communities to effect common-sense standards.</strong> The Pennsylvania DEP has proposed a new set of general permits for the industry that would close the permit exemption for wells and add important new controls such as more frequent leak detection and repair and both wells and compressor stations. That is a good start, but those permits will only apply to new sources&mdash;not the thousands of existing sources including wells and compressor stations that are operating today. Cost-effective technologies exist that can cut emissions from these existing sources for a penny per thousand cubic feet of gas produced.</p>

<p><strong>As the Trump administration works to eliminate air quality standards, we need Gov. Wolf to honor his promise to cut harmful methane emissions at the state level for the sake of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s health and its economy.</strong> Regrettably, state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler has sponsored a bill, SB 175, that would forever tie the hands of our state and put the Washington D.C. lobby in charge of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s air. That is simply unacceptable</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania has an oil and gas air pollution problem, and it&rsquo;s getting worse. It&rsquo;s critical that our elected officials in Harrisburg take the lead on action to address the methane emissions that are harming public health and exacerbating the climate-borne chaos&mdash;floods, droughts, wildfires&mdash;we continue to experience. And since methane is the primary component of natural gas, cutting emissions means that we&rsquo;re not wasting our natural resources.</strong></p>

<p>The latest data showing a 20 percent jump in methane emissions make the need for immediate action abundantly clear.</p>

Meet the Donor: Ann Foster,4/26/2017,"<p>If every day was Earth Day, it would be easy to remind you to take a moment to do something eco-positive for your family, your community, or your state. In reality, we need more than one day per year to remember to protect our home -- our earth. One of PennFuture&rsquo;s long-time and monthly donors, Ann Foster, an oncology nurse, is vocal in her desire to protect our state from climate change impacts and to get more people involved in learning what they can do to make this happen.</p>

<p>She recently sat down to discuss her early introduction to nature, why she supports PennFuture, and her concerns about Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental future for the next generations.</p>

<p>Ann grew up along the banks of the Appalachian Trail in the Valley of Tocks Island in the Delaware River. She recounted the controversial history of the Tocks Island Dam project, which gained traction after a 1955 flood that caused several deaths, and severely damaged the Delaware River basin; how thousands of acres of land were confiscated by the government through eminent domain along the banks of the Delaware, often using not so civil tactics.</p>

<p>Out of the anger and protests by families forced out of their farms and homes, an early environmental movement was born. Eco-activists Nancy Shukaitis, Ruth Jones and others, including a coalition from the Lenape Nation, went before Congress sharing their concerns. Eventually, the dam project became so delayed, it was no longer feasible.</p>

<p><strong>What happened in Ann&rsquo;s backyard woke her up to a myriad of environmental issues.</strong></p>

<p>She fondly remembers her father taking the whole family out to hike the Appalachian trail, early on a Sunday morning, recruiting everyone, whether they wanted to go out or not! He especially loved camping and birdwatching, and introduced Ann to both at an early age.Since then, she hasadded fly-fishing to her list of favorite outdoor activities.</p>

<p>When asked about what changes she has noticed in her area over the years, she was quick to say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come a long way since I was a child. Then, the shad could not run up the Delaware and now they can. It&rsquo;s cleaner, so there have been some changes and huge progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that her children are grown, she has more time to be active as an environmental advocate. &ldquo;You have to work towards making improvements, especially for climate change,&rdquo; Ann said.</p>

<p>Ann discovered PennFuture around 2009 when she found out we advocated on a state and national level, as well as zeroing in on local issues, including litigating to clean up the Brodhead Watershed in her area. Ann believes we all have to address the big environmental picture. &ldquo;What happens globally affects us locally. You can&rsquo;t take for granted what we have here now if we don&rsquo;t take action to protect it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><strong>Why does she support PennFuturefinancially with monthly giving?</strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to donate because PennFuture is critical to address environmental issues. We need the steady consistent support to survive. If folks would give up their &lsquo;on the run&rsquo; coffee, beer or fast food money, and if many people did that, it all adds up and would help,&rdquo; Ann said. &ldquo;Whatever I can put towards making a difference that will help my children and grandchildren when I&rsquo;m gone, is worth it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>What does she love about PennFuture?</strong> &ldquo;PennFuture does so many things I alone cannot do to make that important difference for the next generations. Your leadership is incredible, especially with your timely and critical alliance with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania. Organizations have to work together.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on the future?</strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to enjoy what we have, the Appalachian trail, the Poconos, fly-fishing, our parks and forests, but you have to put some time into keeping and maintaining it. Pick an organization - like PennFuture - and support them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thank you, Ann, for your support and leadership. We&rsquo;re lucky to have you standing with us.</p>

Energy Saving Act 129 in Jeopardy,4/14/2017,"<p>In 2008, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s legislature was concerned about the impacts of rising electricity prices on ratepayers and, in response, adopted the Act 129 energy efficiency program. </p>

<p>Under this program, the Public Utility Commission (PUC) sets targets that are both achievable and cost-effective and electric utilities develop and implement plans to reach those targets. Consumers pay for these efficiency programs through their bills, but the programs are designed to provide more benefits than they cost.</p>

<p>Through Act 129, homeowners and businesses can take advantage of LED lighting, programmable thermostats, energy efficient appliances, home energy audits, and other measures at reduced prices. Sometimes, these options can end up being free for the consumer as a result. These measures also will often lower their electricity bills for years to come.</p>

<p>In February, the independent Statewide Evaluator (SWE) released its final report on Phase II of Act 129, which was the three-year period ending in June of 2016. They found that the program returned $1.73 in benefits for every dollar spent. That is actually a very conservative number, which doesn&rsquo;t include fuel and water savings that often go hand-in-hand with electricity savings. </p>

<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t include health and environmental benefits from avoided pollution, or what is known as wholesale price suppression, because most of our electricity is purchased at auction, lower demand means lower wholesale prices for everyone.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an old saying that &ldquo;the cheapest kilowatt of electricity is the one you never use,&rdquo; but it remains true.</p>

<p><strong>In spite of being highly cost-effective, Act 129 is in jeopardy.</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s natural to expect that companies adopt the low-cost measures first, so it&rsquo;s no surprise to see a gradual decline in the benefit to cost ratio. This problem is compounded because the Act caps investment in the program to two percent of a utility&rsquo;s 2006 sales. There are plenty of cost-effective efficiency measures available, but without an adjustment for inflation, the investment in real dollars declines over time. So, while the available measures cost more, we are investing less.</p>

<p>We also have folks in the legislature attempting to further cripple the program by allowing certain large businesses to opt out. These businesses may have already taken advantage of the program, and they will continue to benefit from wholesale price suppression, but they would also like to have someone else pay for it.</p>

<p>At a time we should be investing more and not less, this would be a move in the wrong direction.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/"">Contact your state senators</a> and let them know that you support Act 129 and oppose attempts to let large industrial customers opt-out. Together, we can make a difference</strong></p>

What makes this federally threatened bird species remarkable is its epic journey: 19,000 miles per year, from Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic Circle and back again, one of the longest migrations in the animal kingdom. But overharvesting of horseshoe crabs by the fishing industry has put red knots in peril: when the starving birds arrive, there aren&iacute;t enough horseshoe crab eggs waiting for them.

Making Clean Energy a Way of Life,3/30/2017,"<p>Piece by piece, Fred Kraybill&rsquo;s lifestyle has become fueled almost entirely by renewable, clean energy.</p>

<p>With a personal passion for fighting climate change and fighting for the environment, along with the drive to be a part of a worldwide shift away from fossil fuels, this Pittsburgh resident is an advocate for all things solar, wind and geothermal energy.</p>

<p>Switching to renewable energy isn&rsquo;t just a dream for Kraybill &ndash; it&rsquo;s a way of life he can be proud of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a gaping failure in the marketplace right now,&rdquo; Kraybill said. &ldquo;The marketplace doesn&rsquo;t recognize the difference between cheap, dirty energy, and cheap, clean energy. To me, climate change is the greatest crisis the human race has ever faced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A registered nurse and shift supervisor at the VA Medical Center, the Point Breeze resident&rsquo;s discovery of the climate change issue and the complex obstacles facing renewable energy&rsquo;s implementation began after he watched the documentary, <a href=""http://www.whokilledtheelectriccar.com/"">&ldquo;Who Killed the Electric Car?&rdquo;</a> The film tells the story about how California tried to clean its air and get off of fossil fuels by mandating a certain amount of clean energy vehicles and electric cars, which were just starting to come out at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sad thing is, the oil companies and politicians killed it in the &lsquo;90s,&rdquo; Kraybill said. &ldquo;The advocates were so passionate about electric vehicles, talked about climate change, wars for oil and why we need to move to clean energy, and that is what got me into renewable energy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He quickly became more engaged as both a renewable energy advocate and consumer. Since viewing the film, he has attended the American Wind Power Conference for the last eight years, and has remained an activist for renewable energy, electric vehicles and moving the country off of its dependence on fossil fuels. Kraybill is a member of PennFuture&rsquo;s Presidents Leadership Council, is a member of SUNWPA, and also is a member of PennFuture&rsquo;s Solar Tour Advisory Committee.</p>

<p>Kraybill purchased a Chevy Volt in 2011, marking his first major investment in renewable energy. Soon after, he took the steps needed to ensure that his electric car was being fueled by clean electricity, and that is when he began to transition his home to solar energy.</p>

<p>He attended a solar energy class at Home Depot before connecting with a local company at the time called Standard Solar. He worked directly with Ian Smith, who now works for <a href=""http://www.eissolar.com/"">EIS Solar</a>. The company installed solar panels on his home and in the lot next door to the building in April 2012.</p>

<p>Kraybill lives in a mansion-style home that has been converted into six apartments. The solar panels fuel the entire home and provide the power needed for his Chevy Volt.</p>

<p>In 2015, Kraybill continued to push to live a life free of fossil fuels, and added geothermal energy to the home as well. The geothermal energy runs on electric, which uses more of the solar energy produced by his solar panels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I became more and more fascinated with the idea of, &lsquo;Can we get off of fossil fuels?&rsquo; I was so far ahead already, so the next big question was, &lsquo;Can we do heating with clean energy?&rsquo; Of course, the answer is you can, but this was a much more difficult installation for geothermal. We have to have a natural gas radiator to back it up in the winter time, because geothermal cannot get the water hot enough to heat the house,&rdquo; Kraybill said.</p>

<p>Fred needs to have a natural gas furnace back up the geothermal energy in the winter time, because geothermal cannot get the water hot enough to heat the house when the temperature goes below 30 degrees. </p>

<p>Currently, solar installation costs about $3.50 per watt, with an average installation involving 5,000 watts. The price continues to drop as the market becomes more and more solar-friendly. Another aspect of living with solar that makes Fred&rsquo;s lifestyle work is net metering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One interesting thing for me is that I actually overproduce a lot of electricity in the summer because I might get 200 kilowatts in addition to what I am consuming, so I am generating a lot of electricity. Because of the net metering rules, which are very important, the utility credits me for that, and allows me to carry them over month to month,&rdquo; Kraybill said.</p>

<p>For Pittsburgh residents wondering how solar energy could power a home all year, even in the darker winter months, net metering is the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beauty of it is that when I get to the winter, I am producing a lot less because there are shorter days and shading issues really start to show up as well. My production drops and my consumption increases because of geothermal, but I have banked all of this because of the electricity I produced in the summer,&rdquo; Kraybill said.</p>

<p>A local resource that makes it easier for residents to transition to solar energy is an organization called <a href=""http://www.solarizeallegheny.org/"">Solarize Allegheny.</a> Kraybill is a member of the group, which offers solar tours and educational events. After people attend an event, all they have to do is visit the Solarize Allegheny website and sign up, and solar installers contact them directly, allowing residents to compare prices.</p>

<p>Kraybill has benefitted from his renewable energy journey on many levels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fulfilling my passion for renewable energy and action on climate change on a personal level, but I also get involved politically because that&rsquo;s where the solutions come from. I am involved in five climate action groups, and two renewable energy groups, so it fulfills a passion of mine to go solar. And it plugs me into a network of a lot of interesting people,&rdquo; Kraybill said.</p>

<p>He encourages his fellow Pennsylvania residents to consider the global issue of climate change &ndash; and to consider its significance and its threat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider the need to do something about climate change. If you have the ability to do something, and it has such a great benefit to society -- do it,&rdquo; Kraybill said.</p>

<p>Fred will attend the <a href=""https://peoplesclimate.org/"">Peoples Climate March on April 29 in Washington, D.C. </a>and he is helping to organize buses of other activists to attend. Every action he takes supports his own personal motto: The solution to pollution is renewable &ndash; it&rsquo;s doable.</p>

Trump’s Attack on our Environment,3/20/2017,"<p>In his first speech before Congress, President Trump pledged to &quot;promote clean air and water&quot; while he nominated Scott Pruitt to dismantle the EPA and gut vital programs across the spectrum.</p>

<p>The Trump/Pruitt budget defunds the critically important climate plan to <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Paris-Climate-Accord-Too-Little-Too-Late-or-an-Important-First-Step"">comply with the Paris agreement</a>, and they propose killing the Chesapeake Bay Program. They have already dumped the Waters of the United States Rule,and they are again allowing coal companies to dump wasteinto rivers and streams.</p>

<p>There are so many critical programs on Trump&rsquo;s chopping block that it&rsquo;s hard to single out an example of what is at stake with so many on the line. Perhaps, the auto efficiency rules that President Obama carried to completion are a good example.</p>

<p>The Trump administration announced that it will roll back auto regulations and weaken the fuel economy standards that were set by President Obamas EPA, requiring cars and light trucks to get a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.</p>

<p>Last month, automakers lobbied the EPA to withdraw that rule when the same CEOs stood with myself and Bob King, who was then head of the Auto Workers. All five of us were asking for these very same regulations.</p>

<p>What haschanged? The gas prices have come down as efficiency reduced demand as the auto fleet turns over. Now, the automakers want to go back to building gas guzzlers and Trump wants to give out favors like candy - and he will deregulate whether it makes sense or not.</p>

<p>These rules save consumers enormous amounts of money over the life of a fuel-efficient car, mostly at the pump, and the cost/benefit is extraordinarily positive. This rule cuts CO2 emissions from each automobile and truck by 50 percentby 2025 as automakers move to electric, hybrids and more efficient drivetrains, aerodynamic designs and lighter and stronger vehicles.</p>

<p>The official government data at the time the rules were adopted indicated: &quot;The benefits of the finalized Obama EPA rules are valued at $144 billion a year (all figures in 2010 dollars). Most of the benefits come from saving lives and other health benefits. They also include benefits such as substantially reduced fuel expenditures by consumers or increased worker productivity (because workers are healthier).</p>

<p>The compliance costs of the Obama EPA rules ultimately amount to about $26 billion a year. In combination, the annual costs equal only about 0.1 percent of the economy&mdash;or one-thousandth of the economy. Compliance costs of this magnitude should not be expected to dramatically influence economic growth or employment in one direction or another.</p>

<p>The net benefits from these rules total $118 billion a year. Benefits exceed costs by a ratio of 5.5 to 1.&quot;</p>

<p>Dependence on foreign oil is a destructive drag on the U.S. economy. Since 1990, nearly $5 trillion went out of the U.S. economy, moving offshore to buy oil largely from the Middle East. Continued dependence on foreign oil presents enormous national economic and security risks, fundamental moral and ethical compromises and incalculable ecological damage to the entire planet. So what does Trump do? He is proposing to eliminate the highly successful fuel efficiency standards, rewarding big oil while hurting the consuming public.</p>

<p>It is time for Congress stands up to Trump and Pruitt and just say no to these rule changes.</p>

The Fight for Our Air Quality: Join Us in Clairton,3/14/2017,"<p>Each morning, Clairton resident Cheryl Hurt makes her cup of coffee, watches the morning news, and checks a monitor to see how the air quality is outside.</p>

<p>The monitor indicates the results through a color spectrum; green is good and anything resembling an orange-red color is worrisome. This monitor, a product of Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s CREATE Lab, <a href=""https://www.specksensor.com"">is called Speck</a>and will determine if it&rsquo;s safe for the kids at her daycare center, held at her home, to go play outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Clairton community, we don&rsquo;t see the black soot that used to be on our bedsheets and windows anymore. But unfortunately, people don&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s the fine particulate matter that is still in the air that is just as dangerous,&rdquo; Cheryl said. &ldquo;I have a responsibility to make sure the kids I watch are safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a prevalent amount of orange and red days found in Clairton and throughout the Mon Valley region, Cheryl has every right to hold this fear. According to the American Lung Associations 2016 <a href=""http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/healthy-air/state-of-the-air/sota-2016-full.pdf"">&quot;State of the Air&quot; report</a>, Allegheny County received a failing grade for year-round particle pollution.</p>

<p>The city of Clairton and surrounding municipalities like Glassport and Lincoln are particularly susceptible to poor air quality due to proximity to neighbor U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works, the largest coke works in North America and one of the biggest polluters in Allegheny County.</p>

<p>This May will mark the one-year anniversary of PennFuture providing U.S. Steel and the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) with notice of intent to file a citizen suit under the federal Clean Air Act after discovering that the coke works committed 6,700 air violations in a three-year time span.</p>

<p>U.S. Steel and ACHD signed a consent decree that gives U.S. Steel three years to bring the facility into compliance with emissions limits. </p>

<p>But can residents afford to wait another three years for cleaner air?</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t think so. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/625607137647829/"">On Sunday, March 26, PennFuture, Clean Water Action, and Clean Air Council will host the event, Breathless: An Air Quality Expo</a>at the Community Economic Development Community Center in Clairton from 2 p.m.- 6 p.m. This event will address and highlight the tools and resources that concerned citizens can use to combat poor air quality in their community.</p>

<p>For example, there are ten Specks, just like the one Cheryl uses, that Clairton residents can borrow at the Clairton Public Library&mdash;for free.</p>

<p>This family-friendly event will have free snacks, beverages, and raffle prizes.</p>

<p><strong>The guest speakers include:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>County Controller Chelsa Wagner,</strong> who will speak about her recent audit on the Allegheny County Health Department&rsquo;s Air Program.</li>
	<li><strong>Knowledge Murphy</strong> of &ldquo;Black Man, Green Plan,&rdquo; who will speak about environmental justice.</li>
	<li><strong>Dr. Deborah Gentile,</strong> who will speak about her recent asthma study in Clairton.</li>
	<li><strong>Ana Tsuhlares</strong> of Carnegie Mellon University CREATE Lab, who will demonstrate how to use a Speck monitor and the free &ldquo;Smell PGH&rdquo; app.</li>
	<li><strong>Dave Smith</strong> of Clean Air Council, who will speak about a website that summarizes the coke process.</li>
	<li><strong>Jessica Tedrow</strong> of Group Against Smog and Pollution, who will demonstrate the importance of air quality through interactive kits for children of all ages.</li>
	<li><strong>Jamie Graham </strong>of the Allegheny County Health Department Air Quality Program, who will speak about any progress from the U.S. Steel consent decree.</li>

First PA Solar Future Stakeholder Meeting a Success,3/9/2017,"<p>On Thursday, March 2, 115 stakeholders met in Harrisburg for the kick-off of <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Finding-Pennsylvanias-Solar-Future"">&ldquo;Finding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future,&rdquo;</a> a 30-month project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy to explore pathways to increasing solar generation to 10 percent of sales by 2030.</p>

<p>This target will require growing our solar generation capacity by about 30 percent per year. That is ambitious, but achievable. Nationwide, solar generation has seen 60 percent year-over-year growth for the last decade.</p>

<p>Finding our solar future not only means a cleaner and healthier environment for us and our children, leadership in clean renewable generation also means jobs for Pennsylvanians. We currently rank 22nd in the nation with a little more than 3,000 solar jobs. While this is a start, there is no reason why we can&rsquo;t be in the top ten. Massachusetts, for example, has about half of the population of Pennsylvania, but still has more than 15,000 solar jobs.</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s no surprise many of the stakeholders are solar industry professionals and clean energy advocates, it is a much more diverse group. As solar power becomes more and more affordable, both opportunities and challenges arise. This has led stakeholders representing electric utilities,our power grid,academia,the financial sector, federal, state, and local government, and interested citizens to coalesce around the Solar Future Project to help chart our path.</p>

<p>At the first meeting, the stakeholders were given the opportunity to join workgroups that best fit their interests. These workgroups include &ldquo;regulations and ratemaking,&rdquo; &ldquo;markets and business models,&rdquo; and &ldquo;operations and interconnection.&rdquo; The first task for these workgroups will be to help finalize a baseline scenario for our modeling and then to begin the process of developing the pathways to our goal. While many of the same issues will be discussed in each group, they each have a unique and valuable perspective.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be held in the Pittsburgh area on June 8 (venue TBA). After reviewing the baseline scenario, we will begin to look at the &ldquo;Alpha Scenario,&rdquo; which will set the framework for future modeling.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not too late to get involved. Information about this meeting will be posted at dep.pa.gov/pasolarfuture or you can email <a href=""mailto:RA-EPPASOLARFUTURE@pa.gov"">RA-EPPASOLARFUTURE@pa.gov</a> and request to be added to the mailing list or the lists for any of the workgroups.</p>

The Importance of Funding Environmental Public Interest Law,3/8/2017,"<p><em>Pictured: Larry Schweiger, PennFuture President and CEO, PennFuture board member Diana Dakey and her husband Alan Dakey, PennFuture client Dawn Gorsline, Michele Batkowski</em></p>

<p>PennFuture just argued one of the most important environmental cases in recent history in front of the PA Supreme Court. </p>

<p>In this role, we were representing two client couples from Fairfield Township who have taken a very brave stand against the natural gas industry&rsquo;s insistence that fracking can and should be allowed in low density residential neighborhoods. </p>

<p>Without PennFuture&rsquo;s talented attorneys, the citizens of Pennsylvania would have no one to argue on their behalf against the highly paid, high power, corporate attorney&rsquo;s proposition of the concept that fracking, which is a private industrial activity, is a &lsquo;public benefit,&rsquo; and that an acre and a half well pad is a &lsquo;public service facility.&rsquo; </p>

<p>Every day, public interest attorneys like ours, take on cases like these, on behalf of people like you and I. </p>

<p>These attorneys either work for non-profit organizations, like PennFuture, or work pro-bono, because without them, decision-making would be made along lines of the financial gains of industries with little to no regard for the people&rsquo;s constitutional rights to clean air or clean water, or to the rights of the environment to protection. </p>

<p>Imagine a world without those people and organizations like PennFuture standing up for you, the public. It is a bleak and dim prospective where government is only influenced by those seeking financial gains, not by those seeking to live their lives free of the harm that comes from being a sacrificial statistic. We need these attorneys to be there, watchful, providing a safety net, and supporting justice.  </p>

<p>We need PennFuture. We need to make sure that PennFuture is funded and that it has the resources to have a team of top environmental talent. We need bright and educated and articulate attorneys who expertly understand the complexity and nuances of Pennsylvania, environmental law, land, and can analyze and argue against the tactics taken by the attorneys that are bought by industry.</p>

<p>We all sleep better at night knowing that when this happens, PennFuture is taking appropriate and legal action to make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t just happen without a legal fight. </p>

<p>In this case, the corporation &lsquo;s attorneys were able to convince Fairfield Township, PA, in Lycoming County, to allow an exceptional use for a fracking well pad in a non-industrial, non-commercial, low density, mixed use agriculture and residential zone. </p>

<p>The company argued that the gas well pad is a &lsquo;public benefit&rsquo; or &lsquo;public service,&rsquo; which would liken it to a hospital or fire station. The flaws in their logic are extensive on that argument, as the activity exists for purely private gains. They also stated that the well pad was &lsquo;low impact&rsquo; and &lsquo;passive.&rsquo; Again, this is an argument that has extensive logic flaws, as is increasingly apparent to the average person thanks to the increase in reports coming to light around the impacts of fracking. </p>

<p>Remember, this particular well pad is targeted to go in amongst residential houses. The company doesn&rsquo;t see the impact on those around the well pad as their problem, and the industry has collectively put their deep pockets behind lobbyists and attorneys with the goal of making this not their problem, or assuring that people and the environment are protected, their responsibility.  Again, that is why PennFuture is here. </p>

<p>We, the staff and volunteers and members of PennFuture, know that the citizens are more important than the companies, that the environment is more important than the industry. </p>

<p>And all other issues with natural gas aside, we stand with you when you need us.</p>

<p>We will take your rights and the protections owed to all of us by the Environmental Rights Amendment all the way to the Supreme Court when necessary.  Article I, Section 27, of the PA Constitution states: &lsquo;The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and aesthetic values of the environment.&rsquo; </p>

<p>Our attorneys, like all other public interest attorneys, are funded by the generosity of philanthropists and the collective donations of the people. And on behalf of my children and theirs to come, I thank you for being a part of that and encourage you to urge everyone you know to join in assuring that funding is solidified so that we never find ourselves without.</p>

President Trump's Real Environmental Agenda,3/6/2017,"<p>During his first speech to Congress, President Trump pledged to the American people to &quot;promote clean air and water.&quot; While Trump praises clean air and pure water in his speech, it rings hollow since the first Trump budget will cut the Environmental Protection Agencys by more than 20 percent. With the EPA already seriously underfunded for the work it does, the Trump budget cans one in five employees with much of the cuts aimed at enforcement and oversight of state enforcement. Important environmental protection programs have also been slashed. For example, his proposed cuts will decimate the Chesapeake Bay Program from $73 million to $5 million in fiscal year 2018. We must ignore his lips, but watch his hands and feet. People who care about the environment and worry about our children&rsquo;s future must understand where this is all headed.</p>

<p>If you are still wondering why President Trump&rsquo;s key appointments to vital Federal Agencies such as the EPA, the Education Department, and the Energy Department are nominees who actually despise the very purpose of the agencies they are now running, wonder no more, because it has been made clear that President Trump and Stephen Bannon want to systematically destroy these agencies and gut their regulatory capacities.</p>

<p>Bannon has purposely maintained the scruffy appearance of one who would be better suited at a neighborhood bar stool, andis now in the right-hand seat of power as Trump&rsquo;s chief advisor and confidant. Bannon has largely remained in the shadows, rarely speaking publicly, until his recent comments at the Conservative PAC. It&rsquo;s now clear that Bannon is a fanatic but he should not be dismissed as a wild-eyed White Nationalist. Bannon has big plans for deconstruction of the federal government, and while it appears to be delusional and grandiose, it is not.</p>

<p>At the recent CPAC convention, Bannon provided a lens into the future that Trump has in store for all of us if we let him. With the clearest explanation for why many of Trump&rsquo;s cabinet choices are well known mostly for despising and attacking the very federal agencies they&rsquo;ve been designated to lead, Bannon made it clear that these nominees weren&rsquo;t appointed to lead essential agencies like the Energy Department, Education or the Environmental Protection Agency, but to gut them.</p>

<p>Remember then Texas Governor Rick Perry running for President in 2012 promised to abolish the Energy Department when he forgot its name? While under questioning for confirmation for the Secretary of Energy, Perry was forced to recant his previous position and sounded a much different note.</p>

<p>Scott Pruitt became head of the EPA, despite the fact that he has been trying to shut down the agency with 14 separate lawsuits that we now know from his hidden emails were spawned not in his office, but by lawyers representing the oil and gas industry. Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education, wants American taxpayers to pay for private schools and even poorly regulated &ldquo;fly-by-night online virtual schools&rdquo; rather than properly funding struggling public schools.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has hatched an audacious stratagem to &ldquo;deconstruct&rdquo; critical elements of our government so special interests, especially the fossil fuel industries, can run wild as never before. When Bannon brags about dismantling the &ldquo;administrative state,&rdquo; what he&rsquo;s saying is that Trump will be unleashing corporate predation with a wrecking ball; letting polluters do whatever they want, whenever and wherever they want, regardless of their impact on our environment or the direct harm it inflicts on American communities. He&rsquo;s plotting the elimination of the very rules that citizens need to constrain runaway greed or halt corporate and bank malfeasance that crashed our economy in 2008.</p>

<p>Little wonder that the stock market has been going wild since the election:the speculators and the barons of polluting industry will be free at last.</p>

<p>At CPAC, Bannon said, &ldquo;every business leader we&rsquo;ve had in is saying not just taxes, but it is &mdash; it is also the regulation. I think the consistent, if you look at these Cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason and that is the deconstruction, the way the progressive left runs, is if they can&rsquo;t get it passed, they&rsquo;re just gonna put in some sort of regulation in &mdash; in an agency. That&rsquo;s all gonna be deconstructed and I think that that&rsquo;s why this regulatory thing is so important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deconstruction&rdquo; is Bannon&rsquo;s code word for the shredding of the federal safety net. This rollback of safeguards has been in the aim of dark-moneyed interests since 1971, when Lewis Powell wrote his manifesto to the U. S. Chamber of Commerce. The Lewis memo inspired a long and deliberate takeover of our electoral process systematically executed by minority interests through such means as voter suppression, sophisticated data-driven gerrymandering and toxic amounts of dark money flooding front groups like the Heritage Foundation, fake news outlets and through super PACs.</p>

<p>The race to the bottom begins.President Trump is creating obfuscation when he says he likes clean air andclean water while he recently authorized the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines despite the environmental dangers, and when he took steps to dismantle climate pollution rules, repealed coal mine regulations, endangered species protections and clean water rules. Trump recently signed an executive order crafted by Scott Pruit to kill the &quot;Waters of the U.S. Rule,&quot;which was carefully crafted after a lengthy scientific assessment by EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to clarify the authority of federal regulators over wetlands and waterways under the Clean Water Act.</p>

<p>The South Florida Water Management District is seeing their opportunity to ask the Trump administration to unleash the district from an important 1992 consent agreement with the Bush Administration that committed the water district to clean up the phosphorus pollution that is severely degrading the Everglades National Park and the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. (Remember the massive algae blooms last summer that were killing manatees and choking waterways?)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, western Republicans have changed the laws to allow a give-away of our precious public land estate to western states so they can be delivered to special interests for exploitation. Here in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania General Assembly has launched a study to determine where Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental protections exceed the federal government, so they can cut protections down to the weakened levels being advanced in Washington. This is not how we &ldquo;make America great again,&rdquo; in fact, the many reckless actions bring America closer to wholesale destruction.</p>

<p>At the CPAC conference, Bannon warned: &ldquo;If you think they are giving you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s prove Bannon right on this point. We must fight those who have set out to destroy our environmental protections. Bannon&rsquo;s agenda is a clear and present danger to the America we all know and love.</p>

<p>We must demand that our government not only protect existing safeguards, but also create a framework for a clean energy economy that is already creating more jobs than oil, coal, and gas combined.Things can rapidly get much worse than any of us could have imagined in our lifetimes. The United States has already set more than 2,800 new record high temperatures this past month, with 738 new records in the past week alone, while we have seen only 27 record lows. It is time everyone must demand our members of Congress and Senator Toomey to stand up against the deconstruction of our governmental safeguards and not let society crumble from the effects of climate disruption.</p>

<p><strong>Please call each of you lawmakers now. Here&rsquo;s a nifty trick: Text your Zip Code to 520-200-2223 and you&rsquo;ll get a text back with the names and numbers of your federal and state representatives and senators.

PennFuture’s “Advocates for Conservation and the Environment” (ACE) Program,3/2/2017,"<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s newly launched <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/join-the-ace-program"">&ldquo;Advocates for Conservation and the Environment&rdquo; (ACE)</a> program is a non-partisan project that organizes teams of volunteers to educate state and federal legislators about conservation and environmental issues. Now, more than ever, the public needs to engage in the democratic process to shape policies that protect our environment and safeguard public health. The ACE program provides citizens the opportunity for precisely this kind of democratic engagement.</p>

<p>Few representatives have the time or expertise to fully understand the implications of all the policies on which they may eventually take a position. ACE volunteers provide policy makers with an opportunity to learn from concerned citizens who live in their respective districts about environmental and public health issues affecting their communities, families, wildlife, and the environment.</p>

<p>Through statewide and ongoing in-district meetings between citizen-advocates and their legislators, <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/join-the-ace-program"">the ACE program</a> is designed to build the environmental community&rsquo;s power in Pennsylvania. An in-district meeting is a grassroots, non-partisan effort to build and reinforce relationships with federal and state representatives.</p>

<p>Importantly, ACE teams meet with Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, to promote policy, not partisanship. In this way, <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/join-the-ace-program"">the ACE program</a> is an extraordinarily effective way to empower citizens with the tools to engage decision makers in their communities while cultivating a sense of ownership in PennFuture&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the program works. PennFuture schedules ACE meetings for volunteers. Then, volunteers meet with other local ACE volunteers and a PennFuture coordinator at a convenient location for a brief strategy session to review local issues, talking points, and a few guidelines to follow regarding meeting with legislators. Finally, ACE teams meet with their legislator in his or her local district office to express their concerns and to help shape policies that protect you, your family, and the environment for generations to come.</p>

Finding Pennsylvania’s Solar Future,1/23/2017,"<p><strong>The next few years will be an exciting time for solar energy in Pennsylvania.</strong></p>

<p>Nationwide, the solar industry is booming. Average installation costs dropped 12 percent from 2015 to 2016, and those costs continue to fall. Increasing demand has made jobs in the industry grow almost 12 times faster than the economy as a whole. </p>

<p>With increasing solar installations, related products including home battery storage and affordable electric vehicles may soon see breakout sales. And, this is just the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Change is coming. The question for Pennsylvania is: What will it take for the state to be a leader on solar?</strong></p>

<p>The PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the federal Department of Energy recently announced a cooperative agreement to answer just that question. Work is beginning on a project called, <a href=""http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/Pages/Finding-Pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-Solar-Future.aspx""><strong>&ldquo;Finding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future,&rdquo;</strong></a> in which DEP and interested stakeholders* will spend the next 30 months investigating how to expand in-state solar generation to 10 percent of sales by 2030. </p>

<p>That is an exciting goal that is leaps and bounds above our existing target of 0.5 percent by 2020. </p>

<p>Is 10 percent by 2030 too high? Will market demand drive us to even greater sales? Either is possible&mdash;that is what makes 10 percent a good target. We need to look beyond incremental changes that we are sure are achievable and understand what a significant change means. What are the technical challenges, policy issues, and market forces we need to consider? </p>

<p><em><strong>How the Project Will Work</strong></em></p>

<p>This will be a stakeholder-driven project. Interested people from across Pennsylvania with backgrounds including business, government, utilities, academia, environmental advocacy, and consumer advocacy will have an opportunity to share their views and experience related to policy proposals, technical issues, and the impact of business models and market forces.</p>

<p>Stakeholders will then help decide which of these scenarios will be selected for additional modeling and analysis.</p>

<p>Modeling, conducted by <a href=""https://www.veic.org/"">Vermont Energy Investment Corporation</a>, will help inform the stakeholders as they refine the proposed scenarios into a set of core recommendations. The results will be published as a draft report for public comment, as well as independent academic review. Stakeholders will have another opportunity to revise their recommendations in light of the additional review before the final report is released as Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future Plan. This report will be available for use by policy makers, regulators, industry, investors, and consumers.</p>

<p><em><strong>Next Steps</strong></em></p>

<p>Together, we can develop a vision of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean energy future.

Funding Our Future,1/12/2017,"<p>We are at the dawn of 2017 and on the precipice of dealing with new political, federal, and state-level elected and appointed officials who are openly hostile to the environment. This is not news. </p>

<p><strong>But did you know that we need your financial support even more now than we have in almost two decades? </strong></p>

<p><strong>Right now, we have an amazing opportunity. Every citizen who cares about our environment and our collective future can take this moment in time to push back and have a hand in implementing PennFuture&rsquo;s mission. </strong></p>

<p>I feel comfortable stating that this is our shared responsibility.And the truth is that without your support, we could not be nearly as effective at preventing the damage we face at the hands of de-regulation and the sale of our public resources to private interests. </p>

<p><strong>This is especially personal to me, which is why I have not only decided to dedicate myself professionally to this organization as its new Chief Development Officer, but also why I am making a personally significant recurring monthly donation to PennFuture as well - <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/donate"">and I strongly urge you to do the same. </a></strong><a href=""http://pennfuture.org/donate""></a></p>

<p>When I first arrived in Pennsylvania, the staff and leadership of PennFuture were among my first friends and colleagues. I was fresh out of graduate school and was going to work for the U.S. Department of Interior&rsquo;s Office of Surface Mining (OSM) as an Environmental Protection Specialist. I had spent the last six years learning environmental education, policy and law. I knew why congress had passed, and presidents had signed, and courts had upheld laws like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Protection Act. I knew how and why the federal agencies charged with implementing them were created, and how much due diligence, scientific research and public participation had gone into the regulations these agencies wrote. </p>

<p><strong>That was in 2000, when we were facing an incoming set of elected leadership under the Bush administration who put a target on the back of anything that looked remotely like environmental regulation or species protection &ndash; very similar to the times we are facing now. </strong></p>

<p>I understood the value of watchdog organizations like PennFuture in that political climate, and the importance of their viability, so I looked to my friends at this organization to fight the good fight, as I did my job with the U.S. Department of the Interior. </p>

<p>That was once upon a time when I was young and na&iuml;ve enough to think that the laws were sacred; that regulations required process to undue. As a federal employee, I was initially shocked to find myself inside of a process which was designed to work like molasses so that no individual could do too much too fast, and immediately undothe incremental steps of everyone that had come before them, just as no one in the future could immediately undo theirs. </p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately, the system&rsquo;s design did not matter at all to the political appointees who were laser-focused on stripping agencies of their abilities to regulate, communicate and coordinate with each other.</strong></p>

<p>The paranoid administration of the time was the same one that sharpened the knife of the Hatch Act, thereby effectively silencing any dissent from individuals inside of the agencies, pulling even the most routine decision-making from the regional and local back to the Washington, DC offices -- under their full and direct control. </p>

<p>Even worse, in very short order, I witnessed the roll-back of legal protections vis-a-vi federal policies and interpretations that were not transparent, and did not incorporate any of what I had thought were required public notice or comment periods. </p>

<p>Unbelievably, a small handful of mining permits that benefitted a small number of people, but were on their very face in violation of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and its regulatory diction, were pushed forward by Pennsylvania&rsquo;s DEP. This happened because of anti-environmental individuals seated by the electorate. </p>

<p>It was done at the expense of the flora and fauna and landscape that make up the state, as well as clean water, clean air, individual homes and farms, and the public&rsquo;s health and safety. It wiped out OSM&rsquo;s long-standing interpretation of the need for balance, ignored all of the scientific work that went into defining that balance, and happened without any real process or evaluation -- just because a handful of people didn&rsquo;t like what most reasonable people saw as reasonable restrictions on mining activity.</p>

<p>The legitimate comments and feedback the public had given when agency rules were passed was swept aside, along with any presumption that as federal employees, our job was to assure that we do no lasting and permanent harm.</p>

<p><strong>This is the reality of the power of a few well-placed ideologues with an anti-environmental agenda. </strong></p>

<p>I made it through about six years of the Bush administration and then I left federal employment to work full-time for nonprofits, feeling disheartened and demoralized, but certainly much wiser when it comes to knowing how much damage an administration can do. </p>

<p>In looking in the rearview mirror, I am confident that this type of damage doesn&rsquo;t just disappear with the next incoming class of legislators or the next administration -- it lingers. And today, the stakes are even higher. I remember back in the early 2000s, I used to wonder if environmental groups were taken unaware. Surely, I thought, if they had been more prepared for the coming onslaught and war against anything that resembled environmental regulation or protection of species or historic places, they could have done something about it. And I was probably right. Had PennFuture had a hefty infusion of funds, they would have been better positioned to win all of these battles on our behalf. And this is what I have joined the team to help with and <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/donate""><strong>I hope you will stand shoulder to shoulder with me to see this through.</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>When nonprofits have money, they can do more and have more impact. </strong></p>

<p>In fact, with enough money, nonprofits can accomplish solving almost any problem just as effectively as any business or government entity can. </p>

<p>We have top attorneys, lobbyists, outreach staff and leadership. We are a well-oiled machine built out of very smart and experienced people. We know how to do this. There is an astounding difference in effectiveness between organizations that are perpetually under-funded and those that are able to bring in sufficient donations to pay for the staff, infrastructure and program expenses to reach their goals. PennFuture will be well funded for the challenges ahead &ndash; specifically in the next four years &ndash; and it is individuals like you and I, standing shoulder to shoulder, who will make it happen. </p>

<p><strong>PennFuture&rsquo;s goal is simple:</strong> <u><strong>We are your watchdog.</strong></u> We fight big polluters and enforce environmental laws with a team of lawyers to protect your right to clean air and clean water. We work with communities to empower citizens to take ownership of their environment through outreach and education. We work in Harrisburg to defend and support laws that protect the environment and public health. And it is exciting to be a part of making it happen. </p>

<p>My dollars, pooled with yours, will magnify our impact and together, we will get the job done.I look forward to working with all of you and I am already inspired by each of you because I know that together, we can fund our future! </p>

Connecting Agriculture to Clean Water Goals,1/10/2017,"<p><strong>In Harrisburg, it&rsquo;s the most wonderful time of the year. Just as exciting as the holiday season, this week, the Capitol Region hosts the 101st Pennsylvania Farm Show &ndash; the largest indoor agricultural exposition in the nation.</strong></p>

<p>We in Pennsylvania have a lot to be proud of, including the many years of accomplishments by those in the farming community. Since its founding, the Keystone State has been a leader and champion in farming and has led the U.S. in the dairy and fruit fields, especially.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone enjoys the milkshakes and animals at the farm show, but what stands out most to me is the return of an open dialogue on the importance of clean water.</strong>Kicking-off the week-long celebration last Thursday, the PA Department of Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding and members of the agriculture sector unveiled the annual butter sculpture, paying homage to the long-standing tradition of conservation in farming. As witnessed by the recent survey results from the Penn State Agriculture &amp; Environment Center, in addition to studies from partners in the environmental community, our neighbors in the agriculture sector are doing a lot of good work, but the work is far from over. This year&rsquo;s sculpture is a great hat-tip to the sectorsdeep culture of stewardship and taking care of our common natural resources -- but we face a formidable challenge in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><strong>Home to more than 62,000 farms, the Commonwealth is in the midst of an &ldquo;Agriculture Re-Boot&rdquo; initiative. </strong>This initiative aims to assist the agriculture sector in becoming more compliant with the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) &ndash; a regulatory tool in the U.S. Clean Water Act, which describes a value of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a body of water can receive while still meeting water quality standards.</p>

<p>By all measures, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s agriculture sector is far off-target for achieving its benchmarks for the 2017 EPA mid-point assessments, and the 2025 targets seem unrealistic unless we change our approach statewide. The agriculture run-off of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment erosion are the largest causes of pollution in the Susquehanna. Pennsylvania is the largest issue in getting the Bay to where it needs to be. And it doesn&rsquo;t need to be that way.</p>

<p><strong>With the new political landscape in mind, the way forward is unclear, but we know one thing: water quality and land-use practices are interconnected.</strong> In order to keep our water clean in our pristine trout streams, restore the Susquehanna, and bring the Chesapeake Bay back to life, we need to take action.</p>

<p>We need to be smart about our choices and behavior, be creative with new solutions, and not be afraid of stepping out from our ordinary routines. We need to provide more cultural sensitivity to the needs and concerns of rural Pennsylvanians and farmers, but educate and reach out to our neighbors at the same time. Imagine a day where we can freely swim, fish from, and paddle the Susquehanna and its tributaries without fear of contamination.</p>

<p>While these challenges seem large and obtuse, there is a great deal of opportunity for tangible work and projects &ldquo;in the weeds.&rdquo; It is essential that we work and support our local farmers and conservation districts to make a real change in the quality of water in Pennsylvania. This can be done by establishing riparian buffers and streambank fencing on our own land, building rain gardens and landscape that helps collect run-off water in our backyards, advocating for increased stormwater and green infrastructure in your local municipalities, or becoming a voice for statewide and federal policy.</p>

<p><strong>Be sure to have conversations with your local farmers, join a local watershed association, do your best to buy food locally, and stay engaged with the connection between agriculture and protecting the water we drink.</strong></p>

<p>The coming weeks will set the stage for water policy in Pennsylvania. The Chesapeake Bay office at the DEP will be releasing its stakeholder meeting schedule for the Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan for the Bay clean-up and we hope that you will join and make your voice known.</p>

<p>Call or email your local legislators to support efforts in the new legislature to implement a water usage fee, increase state funding for the DEP in this year&rsquo;s state budget to carry out the WIP, and increase funding for best management practices for farmers and conservation districts. As we enter into an important year, remind and hold accountable Governor Tom Wolf and his administration, your local congressmen and women, and Senators Bob Casey and Pat Toomey for this renewed focus on the marriage between agriculture, clean water, and the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p><strong>Water connects us all. Pennsylvania has a long and fruitful history of conservation and agriculture. Let&rsquo;s work together and protect these precious resources so that we can continue to build our clean and abundant future. We have the ability to make a difference and give life.</strong></p>

Silencing the Warning Bells of Climate Science,1/5/2017,"<p>In the 18th century, English poet Robert Southey wrote about a 14th century holy Abbot of Aberbrothok who mounted a bell on a treacherous sandstone reef eleven miles off the east coast of Scotland to warn mariners during severe weather.</p>

<p>As the story goes, a notorious pirate, Ralph the Rover, vandalized the bell and dropped it into the sea on his way to plunder other vessels. Having been gone for a time, and on his journey back to Scotland with a ship laden with booty, Ralph the Rover encountered a severe storm and without warning, struck the reef and sank his vessel. Southey writes of the Rover&rsquo;s final moments as the ship sank:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But even in his dying fear,<br />
One dreadful sound could the Rover hear;<br />
A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell,<br />
The Devil below was ringing his knell.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>For many generations, &quot;The Inchcape Rock&quot; was taught as a cautionary tale to dissuade those who might seek to destroy warning bells.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The poem and the moral justice of the story have long been forgotten as the incoming Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress are moving to destroy the warning bells of climate disruption by ending NASA climate research efforts. </strong>Trump advisor and former Congressman turned lobbyist, working largely for the space industry, Bob Walker, wants to purge what he called &ldquo;politicized science&rdquo; by ending NASA&rsquo;s climate change research and shifting the funding to a &ldquo;deep space&rdquo; program in a blatant move to eliminate the warning bells of climate science.</p>

<p>California Governor Jerry Brown responded that his state might even launch its own space program if Trump shuts down the climate satellites and ends NASAs role in climate science. For the past several weeks, climate scientists have been busy copying federal climate databases to private servers to prevent their destruction.</p>

<p>After the warning bells of NASA are silenced, the Trump administration will undo EPA&rsquo;s carbon pollution regulations and fulfill the <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Paris-Climate-Accord-Too-Little-Too-Late-or-an-Important-First-Step"">promise of abandoning the Paris Accord.</a> These are not idle campaign promises by the Twitterer-in-Chief. Despite the many clear climate-warming signals across the planet in 2016, Trump has assembled an administration for accomplishing his reckless ambitions against climate and environmental protections.</p>

<p><strong>Secretary of State</strong><br />
His nomination for Secretary of State, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson (Putin&rsquo;s friend), is ripe for blatant self-dealing over President Obama&rsquo;s Russian oil sanctions as he unwinds the Paris Accord. As the head of a global corporation more powerful than many nations, Tillerson has repeatedly misrepresented basic climate science, supportingborderless world trade in oil while calling for &quot;a global free market for energy.&quot; Tillerson, who has never shown any interest in representing America&rsquo;s broader national interests in the world, will now be our Secretary of State. While ExxonMobil has always had its thumb on the scale of our state department policies, never before has a CEO of a major oil company ever been suggested for this critically important public office.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Protection Agency</strong><br />
<a href=""http://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-CEO-Reacts-to-EPA-Appointment"">I cannot think of a worse choice for EPA Administrator than Scott Pruitt.</a> Pruitt has deep and troubling entanglements with the fossil fuel industry as Oklahoma&rsquo;s Attorney General. He ignored thousands of Oklahoma homeowners who suffered structural damages from earthquakes, now occurring every 12 hours, caused by fracking injection wells. As Oklahoma&rsquo;s Attorney General, he disassembled the environmental enforcement division and led a nationwide fight against EPA&rsquo;s efforts to address climate change, toxic air pollution and to protect the waters of the nation. I suspect the Koch Brothers are high-fiving over this announcement, as the fox will be put in charge of the chicken coop.</p>

<p><strong>Department of Energy</strong><br />
At the Department of Energy, Trump is replacing a brilliant Dr. Ernest Moniz with former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who is best known for dancing with the stars and for promising to eliminate several federal agencies as a presidential candidate five years ago. When asked to name the agencies, Rick Perry forgot the Energy Departments name and ended by saying, &ldquo;Oops.&quot; Perry&rsquo;s A&amp;M college transcript consisted mostly of C&rsquo;s and D&rsquo;s, and contrasts with Moniz, who has a Bachelor of Science degree summa cum laude in Physics from Boston College and a Doctorate in Theoretical Physics from Stanford University. Perry apparently hates efficiency and clean energy investments and hopes to abolish the energy department that oversees everything nuclear, as well as a large and complex portfolio. What could go wrong with this appointment?</p>

<p><strong>The Jagged Rocks of Climate Change</strong><br />
The World Meteorological Organization reported that the global temperature in 2016 is about 1.2C above pre-industrial levels, dangerously close to the 1.5C threshold of the Paris climate agreement. Last year set another new record as the hottest year in history, and not surprisingly, 2016 also set new records for severe and devastating weather.</p>

<p>According to the American Red Cross: &quot;The American Red Cross provided more assistance to the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by these disasters across the United States than in the past two years combined. In 2016, Red Cross volunteers responded to 180 significant disasters in 45 states and two U.S. territories including wildfires, storms, flooding, Hurricane Matthew and other emergencies...&quot;</p>

<p>Things can only get much worse if the Trump administration pretends that the growing threats from storms, sea level rise, droughts and forest fires dont exist, or if they ignore the consequences of massive volumes of carbon pollution-trapping enormous amounts of heat and acidifying our oceans.</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of our political ideology, religion or worldview, there will be a severe price to be paid for silencing the bells of climate science.</strong></p>

2017-18 State Legislation Session: Looking Ahead,1/3/2017,"<p>Get ready for a wild ride.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to describe what could happen when the Pennsylvania General Assembly begins a new, two-year session this week. It has only been two months since we wrapped up the 2015-16 session, which was marked by historic legislative attacks on environmental protection, but next year already portends to even worse outcomes.</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball and can&rsquo;t tell exactly which bills will advance and which won&rsquo;t, here are some major stories to watch for that could have an outsized impact on environmental protection:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>High stakes around the Governor&rsquo;s veto:</strong>Governor Tom Wolf&rsquo;s veto pen is what stood in the way of the General Assembly gaming the Commonwealth&rsquo;s regulatory process so that legislators could unilaterally hold up new rules on polluters. The threat of a veto held up a number of other potential environmental rollbacks. But the November election has changed the dynamic of the General Assembly, providing for a one-party veto-proof majority in the Senate, and a very achievable 13 votes away from a veto-proof majority in the House. The Governor&rsquo;s decision whether or not to veto legislation now becomes even higher stakes.</li>
	<li><strong>Protecting Act 129: </strong>Act 129 is Pennsylvania&rsquo;s central energy efficiency program that is saving ratepayers money and cutting pollution. Yet, at the behest of a handful of large companies, the Senate passed SB 805 in October, which would dramatically cut funding for the program and lower its energy efficiency goals. The House ran out of time to advance the legislation, but the bill will be back in 2017 with more time to succeed.</li>
	<li><strong>Closing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar borders:</strong> Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) has a loophole that allows utilities to take credit for solar projects built in other states. Bipartisan legislation advanced in the House and Senate last session to close this loophole and ensure that solar projects are built in-state. Look for similar legislation to move in the new session.</li>
	<li><strong>New subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear plants: </strong>Three states have extended new subsidies to nuclear power plants, in part to keep zero-carbon electricity flowing to ratepayers. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s aging nuclear power plants are in a similar situation, and may require new legislation to keep them open. In addition, numerous bills aimed at subsidizing natural gas were proposed last session and may move under the new-look General Assembly.</li>
	<li><strong>Water pollution issues take center stage:</strong> Water pollution issues dominated the headlines in Pennsylvania last session with little legislative action. Whether its lead, PFOA&rsquo;s, cancerous fish in the Susquehanna, or cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay watershed, numerous high profile water pollution issues are knocking down the doors of the General Assembly. With a new two-year session to come up with solutions, there is little excuse for inaction.</li>
	<li><strong>Keeping electronics out of landfills:</strong> Pennsylvania&rsquo;s covered electronics recycling market is broken. New electronics are smaller and lighter than previous generations, yet the recycling mandate on electronics manufacturers are set by more recent sales. As a result, recycling quotas are being met earlier in the year, leaving many municipalities without a viable electronics recycling option. Without legislative change, more and more old televisions and large electronics will end up on street corners and landfills, potentially causing pollution concerns, in addition to the eyesore. A number of bills were filed last session to fix the issue and more legislative action is expected in 2017.</li>
</ol>

<p>Stay tuned as we keep you informed as to what happens next in the State Legislature.</p>
