Final Farm Bill Signed into Law Marks Big Win for Conservation,12/21/2018,"<p>President Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the Farm Bill. Aside from being a critical piece of legislation for farming subsidies and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Farm Bill is the largest source of conservation funding in the federal government.</p>

<p>What started as two very different versions of the Farm Bill in the House of Representatives and the Senate, the final Farm Bill passed last week in Congress provided no cuts, and even some modest increases, to conservation funding.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous House version of the Farm Bill, the final legislation did not contain any harmful policy riders, including provisions undermining bedrock environmental laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water Act. The final Farm Bill is also without an attack on our national forests and a weakened Forestry Title, which would have made it easier for industry and polluters to do business without being held accountable and expressly make environmental considerations for their work. Environmental and conservation advocates made the key difference here.</p>

<p>As a part of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, the Regional Conservation Partnerships Program&rsquo;s (RCPP) mandatory funding was increased from $100 million to $300 million annually, and Critical Conservation Areas, like the Chesapeake Bay watershed, will see a significant boost in funding for projects proposed by farmers and landowners in the watershed.</p>

<p>We offer sincere thanks to Senator Bob Casey (D-PA). As a result of his work in the Senate, the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) Improvement Act of 2018, S.2978, and the Chesapeake Bay Enhancements Act of 2017, S.2139, made it into the final Farm Bill. CREP is a critical program for getting forest riparian buffers planted in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which is a substantial part of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). This provision requires that 8.6 million acres of CREP land be enrolled through CREP agreements and other continuous enrollment categories.</p>

<p>Further, this bill maintains robust funding for agricultural conservation easements across the Commonwealth and goes a long way to protect and restore clean water in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and all of Pennsylvania. PennFuture and clean water partners worked closely with Senator Casey and his staff to advocate for his CREP provisions and we are grateful to see this crucial part included in the final language signed into law Thursday. We also thank Congressman Glenn &ldquo;GT&rdquo; Thompson (R-PA-5) for his leadership in ensuring a final Farm Bill that is strong in conservation, clean water, and sustainable agriculture through the entire Conference Committee process.</p>

<p>The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 signed Thursday will substantially aid Pennsylvania&rsquo;s farmers and landowners in meeting clean water goals and will improve conservation efforts to protect water quality throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. From Pine Creek to the Pequea, from the Loyalsock to the Conococheague, the impact of this Farm Bill will be felt throughout Pennsylvania and our land and water will be better for it.</p>

Reducing Methane Pollution Requires Action Now,12/19/2018,"<p>On Thursday, Dec. 13, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) took an important step towards controlling air pollution from the more than 7,000 existing unconventional natural gas wells in the state. They presented to their Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee (AQTAC) a draft proposed rulemaking that, while focused on reducing emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), will also help control methane emissions.</p>

<p>While the proposal is a positive step, the time to act on reducing methane emissions is quickly running out. As the graph below shows (1), the switch from coal to natural gas has reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the state, but this has come at a cost of increased natural gas emissions. While it may be three or four years before the emissions from natural gas electricity generation exceed that of coal, that does not consider leakage during gas production. When the industry&rsquo;s self-reported leakage emissions are added in, natural gas may be responsible for more carbon pollution than coal as early as next year.</p>

<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/methane1219%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 468px; height: 284px;"" /></p>

<p>Considering the actual leakage from the gas industry might be as much as five times higher than what is being reported, and the Federal government is actively trying to eliminate the regulation of methane emissions altogether, it&rsquo;s even more important for the state to take action and directly regulate methane emissions.</p>

<p>Reducing methane leakage is not only critical for our health and the environment, it is also good for the industry. Some companies recognize that investing in cleaner technology will save money in the long run, but without strong regulations, others will always be tempted to cut corners in search of short-term gains. State action on methane can help level the playing field, preventing short-sighted companies from undercutting those trying to do the right thing.</p>

<p>Governor Wolf deserves credit for the steps that have already been taken to reduce methane emissions from new sources, and he further deserves credit for this most recent positive step. But, until we can cross the finish line and get these emissions under control the work is not done.</p>

<p>While Governor Wolf has a unique opportunity to take action, each of us has a responsibility to help were we can. Reducing carbon pollution isn&rsquo;t going to be easy and climate change deniers will be opposed to every step we take. We can&rsquo;t all install solar panels or buy an electric car, but we can all remind our elected officials at the state and federal level that we expect them to defend our right to a clean and healthy environment.</p>

Save the Land and Water Conservation Fund,12/17/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Steve Hegedus, President of the Tri-County Trout Club</strong></em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m the President of the Tri-County Trout Club, representing Allegheny, Armstrong and Westmoreland counties. Based out of Lower Burrell, PA, our organization&rsquo;s objective is to educate anglers for the purpose of enhancing the trout fishing experience and preserving our trout fisheries so that they may be passed on for the continued enjoyment of future generations.</p>

<p>We do this through environmental education and awareness, involvement in environmental projects, and the education of adults and youngsters on the many techniques, forms and pleasures of fishing. Our club is especially sensitive to any issues that threaten the future of trout fishing, our fisheries, and the environment, and we try to combat these threats in whatever way we are able.</p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/lwcfcopy1/index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=d1632337-b691-4718-8bab-a0972c92f4e2""><strong>Congress choosing to not renew the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a bipartisan program that has helped protect sensitive wildlife habitat, cultural heritage areas and outdoor recreation areas across the entire U.S., is one of those threats.</strong></a></p>

<p>I grew up in Upper Burrell. There, I hunted, ran a trapline and developed my appreciation for the outdoors, and while fragmented woodlots could make trespassing an issue in some spots, I also was lucky to have public parks with lakes for fishing and access to stocked trout waters.</p>

<p>After learning more about the LWCF, I was surprised to find out that one of the places I used to fish with my friends in junior high was a beneficiary of the LWCF &ndash; Burrell Lake Park, in the city of Lower Burrell, A.K.A. Holtzhauer&rsquo;s Pond &ndash; and it&rsquo;s also where my club meets each month and where we hold our Kids&rsquo; Fishing Derby every year - all of this from one LWCF project.</p>

<p>In college, I had the chance to hunt on some of our State Game Lands, which have also been increased through acquisitions funded by LWCF. When I started fly fishing, one of the streams where I first &ldquo;got my feet wet&rdquo; was Nesshannock Creek, and you guessed it, also a recipient of LWCF funds. One of my favorite destinations when I first started fly fishing was Loyalhanna Creek in the Loyalhanna Gorge near Ligonier, a natural area which was purchased using LWCF funds. Maybe you don&rsquo;t fly fish &ndash; maybe you like to fish in the river. To fish the Allegheny River near my home, the access areas are at Tarentum or Springdale, and both access points were recipients of LWCF funds.</p>

<p>I could continue, but I think you get the point. If you enjoy the outdoors, it would be hard to avoid all of the areas in PA that have benefited from this program.</p>

<p>If the Land and Water Conservation fund is not renewed, then hundreds of needed conservation projects will have no funding. Special wildlife habitat areas that are at risk of being developed will be threatened, and our country&rsquo;s ability to conserve lands for future generations of outdoors people will be greatly undermined. Increasingly, our valuable natural areas are becoming fragmented, and are being lost due to encroachment by development. LWCF offers a way to save more of them now.</p>

<p>After 54 years of success, now is NOT the time - especially for such a bi-partisan issue - to allow this valuable program to fade away. Let&rsquo;s permanently renew the Land and Water Conservation Fund now with full funding.</p>

Partnerships Created Change this Year and Will Carry us into 2019,12/17/2018,"<div>&quot;Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much&quot; said Helen Keller. At PennFuture, we collaborate with partner organizations to execute our work, we rely on our activists to amplify our work at the local level, and integral to it all is financial support from individual and institutional funding partners. </div>

<div></div>

<div>PennFuture&rsquo;s pro-environment agenda moved forward in 2018 with the help of partner organizations who we teamed up with in coalitions focusing on our top issues, including clean energy, methane, climate, Delaware River water quality and Chesapeake Bay watershed restoration.And while some diversity among the groups goals is a good thing, it&rsquo;s essential that as much as possible, these groups pull in the same direction.It&rsquo;s gratifying to see what can happen when a coalition of national, regional, state and local groups representing advocacy, watershed restoration, land protection, recreation &ndash; to name a few interest groups - come together to create changes that protect our environment.By necessity, many of the organizations around the table in these coalitions also come together to push back against egregious legislation, such as the regulatory rollbacks that were attempted in 2018 and that are expected to return in 2019.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania worked with a host of other &ldquo;c (4)&rdquo; partner organizations, including Sierra Club, to help elect the most pro-environmental class of new state legislators in a very long time. Many of the c (4) groups also successfully worked for the re-election of Governor Tom Wolf.</div>

<div></div>

<div>As we move into 2019, strong partnerships must persist. As the state affiliate of National Wildlife Federation, PennFuture enjoys an exclusive partnership in which both organizations leverage the other&rsquo;s bases and access to national and state policymakers into a powerful alliance. This kind of power-building is essential to fighting the Trump Administration&rsquo;s ongoing attacks on environmental protections and achievements.The latest assault is the Trump EPA&rsquo;s rewrite of rules protecting the &ldquo;Waters of the United States.&rdquo; The Administration, with support from its partners &ndash; including American Farm Bureau, National Homebuilders, National Mining Association and National Association of Manufacturing &ndash; plans to strip away protection from large segments of watersheds, disrupting hydrologic functions needed for clean and abundant water, and for climate resilience.PennFuture&rsquo;s partnership with National Wildlife Federation extends into our Delaware, Chesapeake and climate coalitions and campaigns.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Here in Pennsylvania, the environmental community aspires to tackle some big issues in 2019.A resurging Growing Greener Coalition - a large group comprised of local, regional, and statewide conservation, recreation, and preservation groups &ndash; will be working with PennFuture and others to advocate for replenishing critical Growing Greener funding needed for land protection, watershed conservation, recreation and preservation.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The very symbol of our partnerships, Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda, forged by 26 groups and carried forward through PennFuture&rsquo;s Green in 18 campaign, will move into 2019 as a series of policy recommendations for the Wolf Administration.We are hoping the new class of pro-environmental state legislators making their way to Harrisburg will be the newest of our partners, allies and collaborators so that together, we can move forward exciting policies for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment.</div>

<div></div>

<div>We invite you, our partner activists and supporters, to move into 2019 with us, lending your voices to our common causes, bringing leadership to your communities, and doing what you can to financially support the hard work of PennFuture and our partners.</div>

The Cost of Replacing Nuclear Power with Natural Gas,12/13/2018,"<p>The Pennsylvania Legislature&rsquo;s Nuclear Caucus released its <a href=""http://nuclearenergy.pasenategop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2018/11/Nuclear-Energy-Caucus-Report-November-2018.pdf""><u><strong>2017 &ndash; 18 Bicameral Nuclear Energy Caucus Report</strong></u></a> in November, making the case for preserving our state&rsquo;s existing nuclear power plants and to outline potential policy solutions. While their report is more of an advocacy piece in support of nuclear generation than a neutral assessment of the issues, it raises important issues around the role of nuclear power in meeting our climate goals and their part in a reliable power grid.</p>

<p>Currently, Pennsylvania has five operating nuclear plants and ranks second in the nation in nuclear generating capacity. Of those five plants, two are scheduled for closure&mdash;the 819 megawatt (MW) Three Mile Island Generating Station (TMI) in Dauphin County and the 1,826 MW Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station in Beaver County.</p>

<p>Unlike fossil fuel plants, where up to 90 percent of the marginal operating costs can be for fueling its boilers, turbines, etc., with coal or gas, nuclear plants have high fixed costs (i.e. a plant is expensive to build) and relatively low marginal operating costs (i.e. nuclear plants cost almost as much when they are idle as when they run.) They are well designed for the traditional role of &ldquo;baseload&rdquo; generation where they run at or near their capacity as often as possible, but this also means that they rarely set the price of the electricity market. Rather, natural gas plants that can ramp their electricity output up and down to reflect demand most often sets the market price. As a result, nuclear plant profits are strongly influenced by external factors, such as the glut of natural gas prices driving down market prices.</p>

<p>The most at-risk plants are single-unit nuclear reactors, like TMI or the Davis-Besse and Perry Nuclear Power Stations in Ohio. These have higher operating costs per megawatt-hour than plants with multiple units and, not surprisingly, all three of these plants are scheduled to retire.</p>

<p>We should not minimize the impacts on jobs and the local communities as these plants retire, but our state&rsquo;s nuclear fleet is aging with no real prospect of any new plants being built to replace them&mdash;these are not problems we can avoid indefinitely. It makes sense that the legislature is concerned, but the big question though is what, if anything, they should do about it? Beyond the jobs issue, two major concerns are the impacts on climate change and electric reliability.</p>

<p><strong>Climate Change</strong></p>

<p>The Caucus report makes the claim that, &ldquo;Existing nuclear plants are a critical component of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, and nuclear plant closures are devastating to greenhouse gas goals.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a strong statement, but looking at the data, it&rsquo;s fair.</p>

<p>In our region, most of the carbon pollution comes from the electricity generating sector. Those emissions have declined 24 percent between 2005 and 2016, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the problem has been solved. Thanks to the retirement of a number of large coal-fired power plants, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal dropped more than 53% or 68 million tons over the period. Unfortunately, to make up for the lost generation, GHG emissions from natural gas rose by more than 25 million tons over the period. If that trend continues, replacing all the remaining coal with gas generation may only reduce emissions another 25 million tons.</p>

<p>Replacing the zero-carbon generation from the TMI and Beaver Valley nuclear plants with more carbon-intensive natural gas generation will, on the other hand, increase carbon pollution in Pennsylvania more than 9 million tons per year. If we were to lose all five nuclear plants and replace them with natural gas, that would more than eliminate any gains from retiring the remaining coal fleet.</p>

<p>While clean, renewable generation has the technical potential to replace the lost nuclear generation, the problem is timing. Three Mile Island, for example, is scheduled to close on September 30, 2019. To take its place alone, we would need to more than double&mdash;and maybe much more than double&mdash;our renewable energy generation. That is just not going to happen in time.</p>

<p><strong>Reliability</strong></p>

<p>The other strong claim from the Caucus Report is that, &ldquo;While today&rsquo;s grid can withstand extreme conditions, tomorrow&rsquo;s grid without the reliability and resiliency of nuclear power could, &lsquo;result in material levels of generation unavailability and load shedding.&rsquo;&rdquo; In other words, losing nuclear generation could result in power shortages resulting in blackouts. In this case, &ldquo;could&rdquo; is the operative word. The real issue isn&rsquo;t if the loss of nuclear generation&mdash;the source of almost a third of our in-state generation&mdash;could cause reliability issues. The question is if that is likely to create problems that our existing grid and other tools can&rsquo;t handle.</p>

<p>Our grid operator, PJM Interconnection, conducts a reliability analysis when any power plant retires. If they find the plant is needed, PJM can request it remain in operation temporarily until system upgrades, like new generation or improved transmission lines, can be completed. In exchange for this temporary continued operation, such plants can receive above-market rates for their energy. While tools like this are out there to address potential reliability issues, they are often not needed. In the case of TMI and Beaver Valley, PJM has completed analysis and found that they can retire as scheduled.</p>

<p>Barring some unforeseen incident, we&rsquo;ll probably have at least three-years notice before any of the other three plants retire and maybe much more than three years. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that these plants don&rsquo;t provide some added reliability, but without quantifying this benefit more precisely, it&rsquo;s hard to judge what it is worth to ratepayers.</p>

<p><strong>Policy Choices Moving Forward</strong></p>

<p>Balancing these fundamental truths in upcoming policy choices is critical. In the short run, replacing nuclear plants with natural gas severely hurts efforts to address climate change. Nonetheless, in the long run, replacing nuclear and fossil fuel generation with clean, renewable energy and greater energy efficiency is the only sustainable pathway. Finding a middle ground depends on whether there are ways to extend the life of these nuclear plants in a cost-effective manner, buying valuable time to deploy even more cost effective and clean renewables sources.</p>

Scrooge and Year End Giving,12/12/2018,"<p>Charitable giving has been tied to the end of year holidays since at least 1843 when Charles Dickens published &ldquo;A Christmas Carol.&rdquo; Who doesn&rsquo;t remember the opening scene when the charity collectors show up at Scrooge&rsquo;s office and ask for a donation?</p>

<p>&quot;At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,&quot; said the gentleman, taking up a pen, &quot;it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and Destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>Scrooge replies that he believes the government programs&mdash;prisons, workhouses, and poverty laws&mdash;are sufficient to take care of those in need. They are not. As Scrooge discovers that evening when visited by the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future: charity is still necessary, especially at the end of the year.</p>

<p>It is through charitable giving that Scrooge understands the meaning of the holiday.</p>

<p>And he did it without any concern for end-of-year tax-deductions.</p>

<p>Not that these deductions aren&rsquo;t important, too. Maximizing tax-deductions is a practical consideration that should be taken into account when making a donation, but it isn&rsquo;t the main reason most people give at the end of the year.</p>

<p>A number of studies over the past few years have analyzed why people give to charity and rarely does &ldquo;tax-deduction&rdquo; even make it into the top ten. People give because they truly want to help people in need, and they give to make a difference in their community, and they give to support causes they believe in. We give because we believe it makes a difference. And we give because it makes us feel good.</p>

<p>Yet, even though we know it is the right thing to do, many of us don&rsquo;t give throughout the year and choose instead to wait until the holidays. And that&rsquo;s okay. If you&rsquo;ve waited until now to make your annual charitable contributions, you&rsquo;re in good company! Almost a third of all charitable giving takes place in December, and for many organizations, this year-end giving accounts for anywhere from a quarter to half of their donations.</p>

<p>We give at the end of the year because it makes us feel good to give during the holidays. Whether you celebrate Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa, the winter solstice, or something else (Festivus?) during these cold, dark days at the end of the year, we are all celebrating our community and sharing gratitude with our loved ones.</p>

<p>Tax-deductions are nice, and appreciated, but that&rsquo;s not why Scrooge gave. He gave because it made him feel as light as a feather, happy as an angel, merry as a school-boy, and giddy as a drunken man. He gave because it made him feel good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us!&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>All of us at PennFuture thank you for your giving, and wish you peace, love, and joy during this wonderful holiday season, and a happy new year!</p>

"Despite Trump, We Will Act on Climate",11/28/2018,"<p>Under the veil of a tryptophan-tainted Black Friday, our government released the Fourth National Climate Assessment.If the climate deniers in Washington, D.C. who played out the timing of the report&rsquo;s release were hoping our brains would be so mesmerized by the prospect of great shopping bargains, or still substantially hung over from Thanksgiving feastingfor us to pay attention to the document, they couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong.Here we are in the week after the release of the assessment, and it is still getting plenty of play. Why might that be? Despite the report&rsquo;s piercing truth in calling out the profound impacts on specific communities, and the straight line it draws between climate impacts and the ultimate toll it will take on our economy and livelihoods, the real reason the report is alive and vibrant is that the people of our country care deeply about this issue, and its impacts are hitting home, and frequently.</p>

<p><strong>I believe in the last week the window for climate action has been thrown open wider and we will see an acceleration in climate action, and very soon.</strong>I believe that long time clarion climate champions and warriors &ndash; including remarkable individuals associated with PennFuture such as our board member and renowned scientist Michael Mann, past-president Larry Schweiger, and our current chair Char Magaro, who is almost singularly focused on helping communities address climate &ndash; will soon be joined by new champions. I am hoping newly re-elected Governor Tom Wolf and Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman will emerge with a vision and plan to take on climate here in Pennsylvania and will move stronger policy solutions.I see climate-forward businesses with interests in our state, such as NextEra Energy Resources, Mars and Dansko stepping up even higher. They are being joined by myriads more to lead the private sector.Climate leaders in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s legislature like Leanne Krueger-Braneky and members of the Climate Solutions caucus, are being joined by newly elected pro-environment candidates, including Danielle Friel Otten, Lindsey Williams, Sara Innamorato, Summer Lee, Chris Sappey, Melissa Shusterman, Tim Kearney, and Steve Santarsiero.</p>

<p>This week, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Statement-Petition-Process-on-Carbon-Emissions-a-Positive-Step-Toward-Fighting-Climate-Change-on-State-Level""><strong>PennFuture was proud to support and sign onto the Clean Air Council&rsquo;s petition to the Environmental Quality Board to limit carbon pollution.</strong></a> This petition offers a pathway towards our climate goals and is a backstop to legislative inaction.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the PA Department of Environmental Protection, in partnership with PennFuture and a team of facilitators and stakeholders, <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/SolarFuture/Pages/Pennsylvania%27s-Solar-Future-Plan.aspx""><strong>released Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future Plan</strong></a> to realize more potential for solar energy generation in-state. The plan was crafted and shaped with very significant public participation and presents a viable path forward. Several elements of the plan have already been implemented, including enabling commercial property-assessed clean energy (C-PACE) and encouraging in-state solar development, but there is more that can be done. The work continues on, enabling community solar in Pennsylvania and renewing and strengthening our Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards.</p>

<p>Climate must be further attacked and on multiple scales. Beyond energy, we need to be looking at transportation, agriculture, methane, and other sources and causes. Pennsylvania is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gas in the country and for far too long, we have turned a blind eye to that fact. It is our obligation and responsibility&mdash;now, without further delay&mdash;to each other and future generations to make things better here. Fossil fuel extraction in Pennsylvania&mdash;oil, coal and now gas&mdash;are embedded in our geology, and in the DNA of our communities and economy. The industries associated with extraction have enjoyed primacy here for over 100 years and many elected officials have served at its pleasure.Now, that must begin to change.We must make the hard decisions to diversify our economy, regulate pollution, protect our water, improve our air, and address the climate catastrophe among us.I feel a shift and emboldening and it is long overdue.</p>

Giving Thanks for Open Spaces and Fighting for LWCF,11/27/2018,"<div>Every good thing in life doesn&rsquo;t shout out, &ldquo;Look at me! Look at me!&rdquo;</div>

<div></div>

<div>I think that&rsquo;s what makes this season of Thanksgiving and merriment so important: it&rsquo;s a time for reflection. It&rsquo;s a time to look back on the last year of your life and actively seek out the good things you&rsquo;ve been given, the things you&rsquo;ve learned or the important things that have happened to you. It&rsquo;s a time to count the ways &ndash; however big or small &ndash; in which you&rsquo;ve been shown kindness or love or friendship. It&rsquo;s a time to take hold of the light and harness it for the depths of winter.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>For me, oddly enough, one of the things I&rsquo;m most grateful this year is a campaign I&rsquo;ve been working on over the last four months to push for the reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).</strong></div>

<div></div>

<div>While working on this campaign, I&rsquo;ve realized this outdoor recreation and conservation program has been with me for my entire life, giving me spaces to run and hike, to think and heal, and to learn about the natural world around me.</div>

<div></div>

<div>It was with me every Sunday that my younger brother and sister had a youth soccer game at the Ed Meyer Recreation Complex in Titusville, PA. It was there when I had the opportunity to intern with the U.S. Forest Service as a Biological Surveyor for the Jake&rsquo;s Rocks Epic Mountain Bike Trail in the Allegheny National Forest. It even followed me to graduate school in Boone, North Carolina, when the first hiking trail I ever went on was the Glenn Burney Trail in Blowing Rock, an LWCF-funded site.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>When I look back at my life, I can see traces of the Land and Water Conservation Fund everywhere I go. It&rsquo;s a constant reminder that the recreation complexes, open spaces, and historical sites we visit don&rsquo;t just magically appear. They&rsquo;re planned. They&rsquo;re given to us.</strong></div>

<div></div>

<div>For that, I am forever grateful.</div>

Gratitude as an Attitude,11/20/2018,"<p>As I&rsquo;m sure many of you do, every year when I gather with my family for Thanksgiving we each take a turnbefore we eat, going around the table (or the room if the extended family is there too!) to say what each of us is thankful for. It is a simpleand beautiful tradition, and one that can also produce some laughs (the uncle who is thankful for beer and football comes to mind), and sometimes it causes anxiety.</p>

<p>Honestly sharing our feelings with a group of people, even those who we are closest to, can be embarrassing or uncomfortable for some.</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;ve been a bit stressed for the past week just thinking about what I want to say I&rsquo;m grateful for this year. Not that I have a problem myself with sharing&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t be writing this blog if I did. No, I want to make sure I get it right. I mean, we only get one chance a year to get the spotlight and share like this and I want it to be a good one!</p>

<p>And then the absurdity of it hits me: I&rsquo;m getting stressed out by trying to decide what I&rsquo;m grateful for. Gratitude isn&rsquo;t supposed to make you stressed&mdash;it is supposed to make you happy!</p>

<p><strong>There have been many psychological studies and popular books written on gratitude during the past decade or so that all basically conclude the same thing: the common trait shared by happy people is gratitude.</strong> (If you search &ldquo;Gratitude and Happiness,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll find tons of these available online.) In what is called &ldquo;positive psychology&rdquo; research, studies show that expressing gratitude on a regular basis can actually improve one&rsquo;s health as well as increase a person&rsquo;s ability to have a positive outlook. Gratitude creates satisfaction. And having this positive outlook on life improves our ability to encounter adversity and stress in a healthy manner.</p>

<p>Yep, I was doing it all wrong. By only focusing on one thing to feel gratitude for on one day, I was creating stress. Instead, by being mindful and expressing gratitude regularly (daily!) we recognize the good in our lives that we are fortunate to have. Recognizingand expressing gratitudebecomes an attitude and a way of living.</p>

<p>The Latin root of gratitude is gratia, which also means grace. Being gracious means being courteous and thoughtful to others. It means recognizing that often the source of good in our lives lies at least partially outside of ourselves. This source can be many things of course: family, work, nature, or a higher power. And, it can be charitable nonprofit organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Nonprofit organizations&mdash;whether they are working towards improving the environment, or feeding the hungry, or rescuing a dog, or providing shelter during a disaster, or making the world more beautiful through the arts&mdash;have my gratitude. </strong>Charitable groups, such as PennFuture, do what few of us can do as individuals. By bringing together voices and our resources, nonprofits amplify our voices to have a collective impact. That is the amazing power of nonprofits, and why we support them. And why we should be grateful for them.</p>

<p><strong>And as the Director of Development for PennFuture, I have the very wonderful job of graciously helping to connect supporters of environmental causes to the work that PennFuture does.</strong></p>

<p>So, what am I going to say I&rsquo;m grateful for on this Thanksgiving?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for my family and the love and support they give me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for nonprofits that do the work that I can&rsquo;t do as an individual.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m grateful for PennFuture for the work the amazing staff does to promote clean air, water, and energy in Pennsylvania.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for PennFuture for giving me the opportunity to share this work with others.</p>

<p><strong>And I&rsquo;m very grateful for you, for your support of PennFuture&rsquo;s work. Because we couldn&rsquo;t do it without you. Thank you!</strong></p>

<p>But this Thanksgiving, I think I&rsquo;m going to say that I&rsquo;m most grateful that we have a national holiday to celebrate gratitude &ndash; and how it reminded me how important it is to be grateful every day. <strong>Gratitude as an attitude &ndash; live it every day!</strong></p>

<p>And, Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

Clean Water Advocacy Workshop Teaches Participants to Take Action,11/19/2018,"<p>On Saturday, Nov. 10, PennFuture and Trout Unlimited hosted a workshop at Wildwood Park&rsquo;s Benjamin Olewine III Nature Center in Harrisburg to discuss the Farm Bill, Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort, stream redesignation, and to conduct hands-on workshops for participants interested in water advocacy.</p>

<p>The workshop began with PennFuture and Trout Unlimited giving an overview of important priority areas that we are focused on, along with an overview of why we decided to host the event. After the initial introduction concluded, we divided the attendees into two different groups, where we then began our workshops.</p>

<p><strong>Trout Unlimited&rsquo;s workshop, conducted by Mid-Atlantic Policy Director David Kinney and Mid-Atlantic Organizer Robert Shane, provided an overview and hands-on training about how to write opinion pieces and letters to the editor for newspapers and publications about clean water issues.</strong> Each participant drafted their own writing sample regarding the importance of clean streams and clean water.</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture&rsquo;s workshop, led by myself and Director of Policy Ezra Thrush, focused on how to effectively conduct meetings with your elected officials about clean water issues.</strong> The one-hour session provided a detailed overview about how to set up a meeting with your legislator, including outreach to bring along fellow constituents, conducting the meeting, and following up after the meeting with the legislator.</p>

<p>Following the workshops, we were fortunate enough to be joined by Rep. Keith Gillespie (R-York) and Rep. David Zimmerman (R-Lancaster). Each of the representatives gave an overview of why clean water is important to them, as well as what kinds of environmental legislation we can expect to see in the next legislative session. We were able to hold a full one-hour breakout session with each of the representatives, where the participants were able to utilize the skills they had learned during our workshops and discuss the clean water issues that are most important to them.</p>

<p>Meeting with your elected officials is one of the most important actions you can take as a citizen. It&rsquo;s a small way you can make a big difference in your community. Teresa Caruthers, who attended the workshop, recently began volunteering with the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments and expressed just how important it is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We (Alliance) recognize that clean water is essential for population health, as well as the health of our ecosystems. The PennFuture &amp; Trout Unlimited workshop offered me a timely opportunity to learn more about the broad range of issues, along with strategies to communicate effectively with public officials and the press,&rdquo; Caruthers said.</p>

<p>We hope the attendees at the workshop will apply the skills they learned to take initiative and develop relationships with their legislators moving forward. As we begin a new legislative session in just a few short months in Harrisburg, now is the time to get out and begin meeting with your returning or new elected officials. Your voice matters.</p>

<p><strong>Remember - to make democracy work, we must be a nation of participants, not simply observers.</strong></p>

Our Pocono Waters Forum Educates Community on Clean Streams,11/7/2018,"<p>On Oct.30, <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.org/""><em><strong>Our Pocono Waters Campaign</strong></em></a> hosted apanel forum discussion at East Stroudsburg University&rsquo;s Innovation and Entrepreneur Center. Six panelists from across the Commonwealth came together to educate the public about Exceptional Value (EV) and High Quality (HQ) stream classifications, and why they are important to the Poconos region. More than 110 members of the Pocono Mountains and Lehigh Valley communities attended the forum.</p>

<p>The program consisted of opening remarks from PennFuture&rsquo;s President andCEO Jacquelyn Bonomo, with closing remarks from Trout Unlimited&rsquo;s Mid Atlantic OrganizerRob Shane.</p>

<p>The rest of the night involvedtwo separate panel discussions. The first panel was moderated by Abigail Jones, PennFuture&rsquo;s Staff Attorney. Jones asked panelists many questions pertaining to regulatory items relating to stream designations. The panel was privileged to have Robert Weber of the PA Fish andBoat Commission&rsquo;s unassessed waters program, Paul Wilson, Ph.D, a professor from ESU, and Chuck Gould from Chestnuthill Township, Monroe County, all talking about this important topic. This panel covered everything from macroinvertebrates to township regulations and developments that were not affected by stream upgrades, to programs in place in PA to assess every moving water body in order to enhance and protect the waters of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The second panel focused on users of exceptionally clean streams. Faith Zerbe of Delaware Riverkeeper Network played the role of moderator for this panel. Fred Gender, a local angler &amp; property owner; Gary Leander, a local canoeist; and Gary Bloss, a local business owner of Josie Porter Farms, discussed their experiences recreating on and owning businesses that rely on the Poconos&rsquo; exceptional value and high quality streams, along with their positive interactions with tourists who come to the Poconos for its beauty, fresh air, and elite fishing and boating waters. Fred and Gary had very similar experiences living in the acid mine drainage affected areas of PA and full heartedly expressed how thankful they are for the privilege to come to the Poconos to utilize the pristine fishable and swimmable rivers and streams that flow to the Delaware River.</p>

<p>As the attendees funneled out of the door of the Innovation Center, many different conversations were arising and continuing.</p>

<p>The conversation about EV stream designations will continue between Our Pocono Waters Campaign and the citizens of the Pocono Region to educate about the importance of these protected waters and how showing support for protecting them will increase their value to the region, while still supporting responsible development and economic growth.</p>

<p><em>Our Pocono Waters Campaign is unifying the community while educating citizens, business leaders, and local leaders about the importance of protecting &ldquo;Exceptional Value&rdquo; (EV) streams, highlighting the many ways in which clean streams and economic development coexist in a region known for its natural beauty and booming tourism industry. Clean streams are at the heart of the Poconos, where 80 percent of the state&rsquo;s EV streams are located, primarily in Monroe, Pike, and Wayne counties.

Legislative Session Closes with Significant Environmental Fight,10/26/2018,"<div>With the close of legislative session in Harrisburg last week came significant victories for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental protection, as two harmful bills were halted thanks to our work in the Capital, and thanks to the many citizens who took action by contacting their elected officials.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Senate Bill 652, which aimed to silence those protesting pipelines, and House Bill 2154, which sought to roll back protections and regulations for the conventional oil and gas drilling industry, have both officially been defeated for this legislative session.</strong></div>

<div></div>

<div>This would not have been possible without the advocacy and hard work from PennFuture staff, members, supporters, and partners across the environmental community in Pennsylvania. Through action alert emails that engaged citizens with their elected officials, in-district constituent meetings with members of the General Assembly, calls to offices, sign-on letters with partner organizations and coalitions, and multiple lobby days, our presence and direct opposition to these bills truly had an impact.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>HB 2154 would have greatly compromised air and water quality, repealing conventional oil and gas drilling regulations for almost 35 years by reenacting the Oil and Gas act of 1984. </strong>This bill would have placed profits of the oil and gas industries above protections of public resources and public health. HB 2154 sought to promote the use of drilling fluids and wastewater without any supporting scientific evidence deeming it safe for the public, potentially leaving families at risk. This bill also would have broadly threatened surface water in rural areas, where many of the highest quality streams and headwaters are in Pennsylvania. Additionally, HB 2154 would have opened the door to more drilling operations across Pennsylvania, which would further endanger our air and water, and it called for eliminating protections for public resources, such as parks, forests and wildlife preserves, weakening public health regulations in favor of profits for polluters.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>HB 2154 saw some unexpected movement in the State Senate last week as the session clock counted-down, but PennFuture and our allies were vigilant, reaching across sector and policy areas, to build a wide coalition of groups to garner 26 &lsquo;NO&rsquo; votes on the bill. </strong>Because of this work, PennFuture and our partners were able to block this bill from being brought up for a final floor vote in the Senate before the Chamber gaveled out for recess, beating the industry&rsquo;s efforts. We may see this bill reappear in the next legislative session beginning in January, and we are prepared to fight it again.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Another dangerous bill that PennFuture spent much of its time fighting in the last weeks of session was Senate Bill 652. This bill&rsquo;s language was almost taken verbatim from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), funded largely by the oil and gas industry and polluters.</strong> It was a threat to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s democracy and public participation, and SB 652 aimed to inhibit protesting rights by imposing a felony offense upon any individual who enters a &lsquo;critical infrastructure&rsquo; facility with intent to &lsquo;impede&rsquo; operations. This means a person who attended a meeting during which a peaceful protest was planned against construction of an oil and gas facility could also be prosecuted for committing a felony - the same grade of offense used to define capital murder.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Senate Bill 652, cunningly known as the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, was part of a coordinated, nationwide campaign by the oil and gas industry to shield itself from any accountability for the pipelines, drilling rigs, and other projects they&rsquo;re putting on Pennsylvanians&rsquo; farms, backyards, schools, or close to our communities.</strong> The goal of SB 652 was to frighten Pennsylvanians away from opposing oil and gas projects, even if those projects harm our health, land, or families. SB 652 was an attack on the rights of Pennsylvanians to stand up for their clean air and clean water, and an attempt to silence people who oppose environmental degradation, the potential consequences of natural gas infrastructure, and the reckless behavior of the oil and gas industry.</div>

<div></div>

<div>PennFuture worked closely with our environmental champions in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to speak against the bill in Committee and worked to build a group of votes against the it. After being bogged down with nearly 35 amendments, and because of its ferocious and controversial nature, it became evident in the last week that Senate Bill 652 would not be seeing a final vote on the floor of the House before the end of session. We count this as a victory and will continue to fight it if the bill returns in some other iteration in the next legislative session.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>With the end of legislative session, PennFuture and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment saw another victory with the defeat of the &ldquo;Regulatory Review&rdquo; package of bills, which included House Bills 209, 1237, 1792, 1959, and 1960, which sought to roll back key protections for our clean air and water, and sought to undermine our regulatory agencies, including the Department of Environmental Protection. </strong>Though these bills passed the House in May, PennFuture and our partners were able to stop them in four different Senate committees.</div>

<div></div>

<div>PennFuture also worked hard to advance and pass several beneficial bills during the 2017-2018 session, including House Bill 2468, which increases protections against abuse of eminent domain on plots of land with conservation easement status, such as the Stoneleigh Natural Garden in Villanova and the McCormick Farm in Cumberland County; thereby protecting our parklands and open spaces.</div>

<div></div>

<div>We also worked to pass House Bill 234, which establishes Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Commercial PACE program, authorizing local governments to create energy improvement districts to help fund energy efficiency, renewable energy and water conservation projects. We worked to pass House Bill 118, which closed the &lsquo;solar borders&rsquo; in Pennsylvania by requiring solar projects funded by solar credits from the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) to be built in Pennsylvania.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Several beneficial bills for environmental protection and conservation have failed to pass this session, but we will continue to advocate for them next year alongside partners. Here&rsquo;s what to look for in the coming months in terms of the work ahead:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>The passing of framework and funding legislation for a Growing Greener III program would be a huge step in the right direction for best management practice implementation and increasing funding for clean water across the Commonwealth.</li>
	<li>We will also continue to support legislation like Senate Bill 800, which aimed to revamp the statewide electronics recycling program in favor of a new, more functional program.</li>
	<li>PennFuture and clean water partners will also continue to work with the state legislature to pass a healthy and responsible fertilizer reduction and application bill such as Senator Alloway&rsquo;s Senate Bill 792, which called for the regulation of lawn fertilizer application; its passing would be significant for water quality, especially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.</li>
	<li>PennFuture will also work to pass legislation like House Bill 1446, aiming to increase electric vehicle-friendly infrastructure in the Commonwealth, Senate Bill 1236 proposing to update Act 129, an important utility energy conservation program, and Senate Bill 15, which sought to ensure that Pennsylvania continues to fulfill its responsibility in fighting global climate change, striving to meet its commitments under the Paris climate accord and attain the goals set forth in the Clean Power Plan.</li>
	<li>In terms of renewable energy, PennFuture, in the next session, will advocate for community solar legislation like that of House Bill 2681, and a renewal of the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) legislation.</li>
</ul>

<div>For now, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and State Senate will return to Harrisburg after the elections on Nov.13and 14for the start of new member orientation, leadership elections, and caucus reorganization, but are not expected to move any legislation for the rest of this year. The General Assembly will likely be back during the first full week of January 2019 and we will continue to advocate for a clean and responsible state budget, track and advance legislation that protects our environment, acts on climate, and we will defend against any attacks on our Commonwealth&rsquo;s crucial clean air, water, and natural resource protections.</div>

PennFuture Celebrates Legal Victory for Exceptional Value Streams,10/23/2018,"<p>Some of the cleanest water in Pennsylvania flows fromthe Poconos &ndash; the headwater streams of our majestic Delaware River. <strong>PennFuture, representing itself and Brodhead Watershed Association, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-and-Brodhead-Watershed-Association-Earn-Legal-Victory-for-Exceptional-Value-Streams-in-the-Poconos"">won a significant legal victory earlier this month</a> when the Environmental Hearing Board (EHB) dismissed a challenge to the classification of four of those headwater streams as Exceptional Value.</strong></p>

<p>Adding to a long list of legal wins over PennFuture&rsquo;s 20 year history, this decision by the EHB held back an attack by a group of resorts and developers who challenged the process by which the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection classifies waters for protection. In this instance, the four streams under scrutiny &ndash; Swiftwater Creek, Paradise Creek, Tunkhannock Creek and Devil&rsquo;s Hole &ndash; will receive the highest level of protection from degradation through the Exceptional Value classification. And that&rsquo;s a really good thing, because there is a very long list of communities, livelihoods, economies and critters who benefit from this cleanest of water.</p>

<p>The group who brought this legal action against DEP -- in which PennFuture and Brodhead Watershed Association intervened -- includes the largest resorts in the Poconos. The resorts have plans to build, grow, and become even larger. And while they say they are environmentalists, we see that they aren&rsquo;t green enough to develop in a way that respects the purity of Pocono water, the integrity of its forested landscape, unique natural beauty, or the history of the area as a mecca for quiet respite in the outdoors for over a century. These businesses find environmental rules too tough and costly to comply with, and to make it all a little easier, question the state&rsquo;s scientists, and ask the courts to make it easier for them to develop by allowing some pollution to the streams that stand in their way. We expect that these resorts will continue to try to undermine clean streams protections, and PennFuture will be here to fight back.</p>

<p>In March 2017, PennFuture moved its northeast office to Mount Pocono. We became part of the community and were welcomed by the rich array of water advocates, land protectors, and recreationists who for decades stewarded these lands and waters. This move proved to be fortuitous and put PennFuture in one of the most important disputes around clean water in a long time. PennFuture&rsquo;s lawyers had represented several of these groups and their interests in the past, resulting in strong relationships that were already in place. The organization was able to quickly mobilize to defend the exceptional water of the Poconos.<strong>The stakes for the future of the Poconos are high, and the work to protect the region by necessity involves more than litigation. </strong></p>

<p>As a complement to our legal work, we are part of the very exciting <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.org/""><u><strong>Our Pocono Waters Campaign</strong></u></a>, launched earlier this fall with key partners including Trout Unlimited, Delaware Riverkeeper Network and many more stewards of the Poconos environment, including a growing list of businesses and civic organizations. <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.org/our-pocono-waters-partners/""><u><strong>These groups and businesses</strong></u></a> are advancing a sustainable vision for growth in the Poconos, in an endeavor to keep the natural assets and character of the region that make is so special.<br />
This fight for clean water in the Poconos includes a display of grassroots support, so that elected officials in each of Monroe County&rsquo;s 17 municipalities &ndash; as well as the greater Pocono region &ndash; understand there is broad support for true environmental protection and sustainable growth.<strong>That show of force is building through an online petition that to-date has over 2,200 signatures and <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/protectourpoconowaters/index.html""><u>we hope you will sign and be part of this important fight.</u></a></strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/103018cleanstreamsthepoconosandyouforum/index.html""><strong>On Tuesday, Oct. 30 from 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Our Pocono Waters Campaign is presenting a forum entitled &ldquo;Clean Streams, the Poconos, and You&rdquo; at East Stroudsburg University.</strong></a>The evening is an opportunity for you to learn more from expert panelists, including understanding the regulatory protection of water in Pennsylvania, and hearing from businesses and recreationists that rely on clean water. Let&rsquo;s all stay informed and educated on these issues.</p>

<p>Finally, we will not win this fight without money.PennFuture is raising funds for our legal defense of Exceptional Value waters in the Poconos to continue to fight on the legal front.The battle for the Poconos&rsquo; clean water is not over, and we are also preparing for similar fights in other parts of the state.<strong>Our fund goal is $25,000 <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018OPWCampaign/index.html"">and if you can make a contribution</a>, you can help keep us in the fight.</strong>This campaign for clean water will take legal muscle, broad support from grassroots, businesses and civic-minded organizations, well-informed citizens and advocates and sufficient financial resources.<strong>Let&rsquo;s work together to be prepared for a long fight.</strong></p>

"With New Climate Report Issued, PennFuture Continues Legacy of Work",10/12/2018,"<p>I&rsquo;ve waited five days to write something about the October 8 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) document, <a href=""http://sdg.iisd.org/news/ipcc-special-report-limiting-global-warming-to-1-5c-will-require-unprecedented-transitions/""><strong>The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&ordm;C</strong></a>. This time around, the panel uses its powerful voice and platform to pronounce that we are living through the impacts of 1 degree change. This time, the IPCC makes its case that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is the best pathway to avoid the irreversible impacts of climate change. The panel makes no bones that to get there will be extremely challenging, and that no sector of society can sit out doing its part to greatly limit its carbon footprint.</p>

<p>By now, millions will have said something about the report on social media, or to their friends and family. I can&rsquo;t offer anything original or that hasn&rsquo;t been said many, many times since last Saturday. So, I find myself asking how, if, the report changes the world for PennFuture? If I am going to be honest with my answer, it doesn&rsquo;t. <strong>We operate from the same pronounced, crucial and excruciating imperative to act on climate this week, as we did when we formed as an organization 20 years ago.</strong></p>

<p>By the time PennFuture was founded in October 1998, Dr. James Hansen&rsquo;s testimony to Congress on global warming was ten years old. The NASA climate scientist noted the warmth of the earth at that time was the hottest ever, and that there was enough data for him to say that extreme weather was attributable to impacts from the greenhouse gas effect. In 1990, the IPCC issued its first assessment, this time the science and the call to act wasn&rsquo;t a single voice speaking from within NASA, it was a large body of scientists presenting more data and recommendations for policy makers upon which the United Nations was then to act through the UN Framework on Climate Change. The Framework was ratified at the Earth Summit in Rio in &lsquo;92, taken up again in Kyoto, further shaped in Bali, Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban until finally the United States, China, India and the entirety of the world embraced a chance through the Paris Climate Accord in 2015.</p>

<p>Here in Pennsylvania, PennFuture was making progress, a little at a time, helping the state set goals for renewables, helping consumers make good energy choices, helping nascent alternative energy businesses get their legs under them and connect to a growing network through the early days of our Energy Center. We began dealing with the onslaught of gas, working for guidelines and protections for communities&hellip;always with ambitions to do more, to provide leadership at a scale that meets the imperative, to act in ways that meet the growing climate crisis described by 40 years of excruciating science, and now, with almost daily evidence of the changing world around us &ndash; everywhere.</p>

<p>So, here at PennFuture, we are settled into the work we have to do. We&rsquo;re doing some planning, and we are hoping it will be informed by outcomes of November 6, Election Day. We hope you will vote, and vote with the environment and our climate in mind. We hope Election Day will bring change and send enough of a message to give elected officials who in their hearts know the time has come to act, the will to step up and with your help, and the help or organizations like PennFuture, finally make Pennsylvania a climate leader.</p>

Lancaster County’s Road to Water Restoration,10/10/2018,"<div>Back in April when I first began my journey at PennFuture, I published the blog <a href=""/Blog-Item-Building-a-Community-Clean-Water-Toolbox-How-PA-Will-Meet-its-Goals""><em>Building a Community Clean Water Toolbox: How PA Will Meet its Goals</em></a>. During the time, Pennsylvania had just launched its pilot program in Franklin, Adams, York, and Lancaster counties to meet its Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency. Since this time, significant progress has been made by each of these counties in the development of action plans to reduce pollution runoff going into our local waterways.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Franklin and Adams counties have been meeting with the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s (DEP) Chesapeake Bay office to develop their toolboxes; York County has been hosting bi-weekly meetings to develop their pollution diet plan, with only a few meetings left until they release their plan to the public. Lancaster County Clean Water Partners have been convening every two weeks in the development of their toolbox, and officially released their draft strategy for restoring local water quality on Wednesday, Oct. 3.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The draft plan, developed by the Partners, focuses on cleaning up local waters in Lancaster County, where 21 percent of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s pollution reduction goals need to occur. It is a tall task, as 1,400 miles of streams in the county, or 50 percent, are considered &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; by the EPA. This means that the bodies of water are considered too polluted or otherwise degraded to meet the water quality standards set by the states, territories or authorized tribes in the U.S. under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. Coupled with this is the troubling fact that 80 percent of the pollution reduction goals need to come from the agriculture sector alone. In total, Lancaster County must reduce 11 million pounds of pollution (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment) loading into the Chesapeake Bay by 2025.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Who Led These Efforts?</strong></div>

<div>The Clean Water Partners writing team, led by Justin Evans, Allyson Gibson, Brian Gish, Ruth Hocker, Mark Huber, Peter Hughes, Matt Kofroth, Joe Sweeney, Chris Thompson, Joellyn Warren , and many others, met every two weeks to develop the draft plans that were presented at the meeting. Over the last several months, the Partners have conducted municipal roundtables, orchestrated engineer luncheons, hosted conference calls with the Agricultural Council, and met with the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program. Their primary objective was to act as an &ldquo;information hub&rdquo; for all of the suggestions, and make sure that all of the information necessary to develop the draft, and solicit input from stakeholders, was centralized.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>What Does the Draft Strategy Look Like?</strong></div>

<div>The draft plan focuses on six key areas that need to be addressed in order to meet compliance with the TMDL. These areas include data management, agriculture, stormwater, buffers, stream restoration, and land use and preservation.</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Data Management: </strong>Areas of improvement include a central location for conservation plans, restoration project permits, and grant applications. It also emphasizes the importance of improved documentation of current practices, more in-stream water quality monitoring to establish baselines, and identifying the best tools needed to achieve the goals and to measure progress and success.</li>
	<li><strong>Agriculture: </strong>In order to come to compliance and meet the 80 percent reduction goals necessary in the agriculture sector, the writing team laid out several important areas to focus on. This includes implementing better manure management practices, with a goal of reducing 25 percent of the annual application. In order to do this, they suggested introducing an end to winter spreading, and identifying and promoting the best location-specific alternate practices to deal with manure. Along with this, the team also highlighted the importance of acknowledging the need for a five to eight year phase-in period and to provide support. Other areas of improvement include building new manure storages and implementing barnyard management in priority areas, establishing a recording system of manure transport in and out of the county, increasing the number of farms who do livestock stream access management by 50 percent, increasing cover crops by 40 percent, increasing no-till and/or conservation tillage, and increasing buffer and stream restoration.</li>
	<li><strong>Stormwater: </strong>In order to meet compliance in stormwater pollution reduction, the Partners suggested several scenarios. Identifying alternative sources of project possibilities that receive credit above compliance, developing and encouraging adoption of local land use ordinances to address stormwater more efficiently, and implementing innovative water quality projects that are effective and cost-efficient are all possibilities.</li>
	<li><strong>Buffers:</strong> In the blog I highlighted in the opening paragraph, I illustrated the importance of buffers on water quality. The Partners recognize the cost-efficient values that buffers provide, and suggest including an exemplary buffer demonstration of one to two acres in every township, creating an online map of buffer implementation to show progress, and direct landowner outreach for implementation to show progress. In conjunction with this, Lancaster County also aims to create a buffer program to complement CREP, and create and coordinate outreach campaigns for all public lands and semi-public lands to be required to install buffers.</li>
	<li><strong>Stream Restoration:</strong> The Partners outlined 50 projects plus basic, cost-effective monitoring of before and after water quality results that are shared.</li>
	<li><strong>Land Use &amp; Preservation: </strong>Finally, the Partners suggested implementing county planning initiatives, better growth management practices, improved planning and design, increased natural resources, open spaces and parks, and increasing tree canopy in both rural and urban areas.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Where Does This Draft Succeed?</strong></div>

<div>The draft plan written by the Partners highlights some of the key areas that have been severely lacking in the last 8 years of the Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). Through the first two phases of the WIP (2010-2017), there was a centralized, top-down approach to regulating the counties, which solicited less input from key stakeholders and limited their ability to contribute to the development of the projects. That all changed with the Phase III WIP &ndash; as it stresses the importance stakeholder engagement and has allowed the counties to develop their own toolboxes based on the geography, urban and rural makeup, and technical assistance necessary to reach their pollution reduction goals. Lancaster&rsquo;s draft strategy for restoring their local water quality emphasizes a comprehensive, grassroots, and integrated approach to reducing water pollution by bringing together a diverse set of voices with a myriad of technical expertise.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Where Do We Go from Here?</strong></div>

<div>It must be noted that these strategies are only a draft of the final product, and the final version will undoubtedly go into much greater detail of how to specifically reduce pollution based on each sector. For the last half of the meeting, the Partners solicited input in the form of roundtable discussions from the nearly 100 participants who attended. They will take the feedback they have received, continue to work on and revise the plan, and present it to the Chesapeake Bay Office in early November.</div>

<div>There is still work to be done before the draft will be finalized &ndash; but, we&rsquo;re in the end game now.</div>

A Successful Forum to Celebrate the Delaware River Watershed,10/9/2018,"<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/CDRW%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 547px; height: 492px;"" /></p>

<p>The Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed (CDRW) celebrated its sixth annual Delaware River Watershed Forum in Cape May, NJ on September 25 and 26. As attendees walked through the doors of the conference center at the Grand Hotel, there was an aura of victory amongst them. In the last year, this same group of people have celebrated wins and advanced new priority goals while swimming through a very challenging political climate.</p>

<p>In March 2018, for the first time in history, the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program (DRBRP) received $5 million in funding as part of the Fiscal Year 2018 Omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed by the President. Because of this, dedicated funds will now go to on-the-ground projects designed to conserve and restore wildlife and fish habitats, improve water quality, and increase public access to the Delaware River and its tributaries.</p>

<p>The forum hosted a plethora of opportunities for attendees to network, learn about new programs, and educate their colleagues about work presently going on in the basin. They heard welcome remarks from CDRW&rsquo;s new director, Sandra Meola, along with words from Eric Stiles, President and CEO of New Jersey Audubon, who promoted the goal of every stream in the Delaware Basin becoming &ldquo;fishable and swimmable&rdquo; for generations to come. For the next two days, there were so many different discussions and presentations to choose from to attend. Members had their choice of the Wild and Scenic Rivers program to Agricultural Best Management Practices to advocacy efforts to municipal engagement techniques. Any topic there may have been an interest in could have been found at this forum.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s President and CEO Jacquelyn Bonomo welcomed everyone to the banquet dinner and reinforced the importance of partnering on projects to be successful. It was exhilarating to see everyone take out their cell phones and sign <a href=""http://www.ourpoconowaters.org""><strong>Our Pocono Waters Campaign petition</strong></a>, stating why exceptional value streams are important to them before they sat down to share a meal with colleagues and friends. After dinner, the networking continued over ice cold local craft brews in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/4-The-Delaware-1510522942349896/""><strong>4theDelaware Campaign</strong></a> pint glasses and live music. Some of the networking even shifted to the beach as attendees gazed at the harvest moon.</p>

<p>To wrap up the forum, the group had the privilege of listening to the stories and checking out some amazing river pictures by Tim Palmer, an author and photographer focusing on rivers, conservation, and the environment. As everyone said their good-bye-for-now&rsquo;s at the end of the last session, the positive thinking and eagerness to get back to their computer desks, sampling equipment, and conference calls to further the mission and priorities of CDRW could not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The coalition&rsquo;s seventh year will hold new obstacles, successes, and opportunities for all members of the coalition, but with teamwork and common goals, this group will see success once again when they meet for the 7th Annual Delaware River Watershed Forum.</p>

<p><strong>As the Pennsylvania state lead for the CDRW, PennFuture is dedicated to mobilizing the priorities of the coalition through watershed outreach, policy monitoring, and basin wide partnerships.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;The mission of the Coalition is to unite organizations and enhance their capacity to effectively advocate for protecting and restoring the Delaware River Basin by coordinating communications, messages, and actions and fostering accountability for success at the federal, state, and local levels.&rdquo; &ndash; CDRW mission statement.

"Artists Interpreting Climate Change, Part II",10/1/2018,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">A few weeks ago, <a href=""/Blog-Item-How-Artists-Interpret-Climate-Change-Raise-Awareness"">I wrote a blogabout how artists are interpreting climate change,</a> and what some artists are doing to prevent it. Since then, I&rsquo;ve heard from a number of people about other creative projects dealing with these issues. I quickly realized that I needed to write a sequel blog on the subject.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Not all artists use paint and canvas to pay attention to climate change.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">One of the most amazing uses of creative technology, which many of us recently saw, was when <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRkXPuGAHkE"">The Weather Channel used augmented reality graphics</a>to demonstrate the possible effects of Hurricane Florence&rsquo;s storm surge. Meteorologists were surrounded on screen by the rising water, carrying floating cars and other debris, while they explained the potential danger of the surge. The Weather Channel is partnering with The Future Group to take an &ldquo;Unreal Engine&rdquo; (originally created for video games) and use it as &ldquo;immersive mixed-reality technology&rdquo; to improve their viewers&rsquo; understanding of weather phenomena. Michael Potts, TWC&rsquo;s vice president of design, said that this technology, which wasn&rsquo;t even available a few months ago, &ldquo;allows us to paint pictures&rdquo; unlike anything anyone has ever seen. These are high-tech artists at work.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">A musician who is paying attention to climate change is GZA, one of the founding members of the hip-hop group, Wu-Tang Clan. GZA isn&rsquo;t rapping about the climate. He&rsquo;s exploring it in his TV series, &ldquo;Liquid Science.&rdquo; The first episode is titled Global Warming, and is available on Netflix <a href=""https://www.redbull.com/int-en/tv/video/AP-1N7M59QHW2111/global-warming?playlist=AP-1N83MJWAH2111:season:1"">or can be streamed here</a>.Other episodes of the series take GZA on a journey where he meets with scientists and engineers who are shaping the future. All of them are worth watching.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Closer to home, the environmental artist Stacy Levy has created an installation in the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia called Tide Field, through Nov. 20, which uses &ldquo;art as a vehicle for translating the patterns and processes of the natural world.&rdquo; The piece, commissioned by the Mural Arts Philadelphia and Bartram&rsquo;s Garden, consists of hundreds of multi-colored caterpillar-like buoys which move with the tidal flow. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q-soXXKN70&amp;w=840&amp;h=473"">There is a great video of the work here. </a>I first became aware of Levy&rsquo;s work when I visited the Frick Environmental Center in Pittsburgh this summer and saw her beautiful Rain Ravine, which funnels water from the rooftop down almost 300 feet across a sandstone sculpture to the wetlands below. <a href=""http://pghsolartour.org"">If you are planning to go on PennFuture&rsquo;s Solar Tour this Saturday</a>,you can view it then.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">An entire exhibit of works made with non-traditional materials is at the <a href=""https://www.brandywine.org/museum"">Brandywine River Museum of Art</a>through Oct. 21. Natural Wonders: The Sublime in Contemporary Art, features 13 American artists examining our relationship with nature. According the curator, Suzanne Ramljak, the works &ldquo;reflect the current anxiety and concern for the sustainability of the Earth&rsquo;s resources.&rdquo; The exhibit is meant to complement the work of the Brandywine Conservancy and its efforts to protect land and water in the Brandywine Valley.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">As cool as all of these uses of innovative materials, approaches, and technology are, the most exciting thing I&rsquo;ve seen since posting my first blog was that the <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/"">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>actually has a position on their staff for working with artists who pay attention to climate change! &ldquo;One of the really hard things about climate change is that people struggle to imagine it, and imagine what it looks like,&rdquo; says Elizabeth Corr, Manager of Arts Partnerships for the NRDC. &ldquo;Artists and art have the incredible ability to break down that barrier . . . that allows the public to interact, to ask questions, to have emotive responses, to feel. And once they&rsquo;re feeling, they&rsquo;ll be more inclined to take action.&rdquo; NRDC also has its own <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/stories/can-public-art-save-planet"">artists-in-residence program</a>to support this work. Wow!</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">While I continue to explore how artists are paying attention to climate change, I keep thinking back to one of the most interesting books I read in graduate school, <a href=""http://www.artandphysics.com/"">Leonard Shlain&rsquo;s Art &amp; Physics.</a> Shlain, a medical doctor, takes his reader on a historical tour of how people understand reality &ndash; through art and through science. Written in a way that is accessible to everyone, he makes the argument that art and science are parallel visions that have been informing each other throughout time.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Seeing how artists are tackling issues of science in their work that comments on, and in some cases tries to prevent, climate change, is inspiring. As we work to save our planet for future generations, it is even more important to now recognize these parallel methods of understanding and changing, our world.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I can&rsquo;t wait to see what we do next!</p>

The Inevitable Policy Response Theory,9/26/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Christina Simeone, Director of Policy and External Affairs at Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.</strong></em></p>

<p>As PennFuture recognizes climate month and the state of Pennsylvania enjoys its <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/clean-energy-week-2018/""><strong>newly minted clean energy week </strong></a>with a proclamation from Gov. Tom Wolf, a new thought provoking theory is introduced from the international financial community that I thought I&rsquo;d share.</p>

<p>The theory is called the <u><strong><a href=""http://www.unpri.org/"">Inevitable </a><a href=""http://www.unpri.org/"">Policy Response (IPR),</a></strong></u> and it predicts a rapid and forceful international policy reaction to climate change with widespread financial implications.</p>

<p>The theory was introduced by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), which is an independent, institutional investor-driven proponent of <a href=""https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=1534""><strong>responsible investment</strong></a>, with signatories representing over $59 trillion in assets. PRI works internationally, in partnership with the UN Global Compact and UNEP Finance Initiative.</p>

<p>PRI issued a series of policy and technical papers on the IPR to inform institutional investors about the IPR risks, and to help prepare them to navigate pending market turbulence.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s breakdown the IPR theory.</p>

<p><strong>The Policy Ambition Gap. </strong>The logic from the folks at PRI starts with recognizing there is a &ldquo;policy ambition gap&rdquo; in the Paris Agreement serving as an uncertainty in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. This is the white space between the national pledges (i.e. the nationally determined contributions) and the 2&deg;C pathway in dark blue.</p>

<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/christinablog%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 452px; height: 245px;"" /><br />
<br />
<strong>What is IPR?</strong> IPR is the missing, but required, policy action to move the world towards a target of 1.5&deg;C to 1.75&deg;C with 50 &ndash; 66% probability (i.e. closing the Policy Ambition Gap). The longer there is a delay in emissions reduction policy implementation now, the greater the need for more rapid, forceful, and disruptive policy action in the future.</p>

<p>PRI is concerned about the IPR, because they believe companies and investors will essentially be price-takers during a period of immense volatility. This volatility is expected to occur after announcement of the IPR, as the markets adjust to expected policy-driven actions.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this Inevitable? </strong>PRI contends several factors will coalesce to <a href=""https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5378""><strong>trigger </strong></a>the IPR. As the physical (e.g. extreme weather) and economic (e.g. insurance industry) impacts of climate change become more visible, attitudes will change and place social pressure on policymakers. Security issues related to climate impacts&mdash;from migration to regional destabilization&mdash;will increase. Investors will push to reduce regulatory uncertainty and risk on greenhouse gases to inform long-term investments, and the cost-competitiveness of low-carbon technologies will continue to improve.</p>

<p><strong>When, What, and How?</strong> After examining the forthcoming schedule of post-Paris national pledges, <a href=""https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5368""><strong>PRI concludes the IPR will occur by 2025</strong></a> (around the time of the &ldquo;Global Stocktake&rdquo;). The IPR could consist of coordinated global action, or could be comprised by enhanced commitments from leadership nations, states, and economies. PRI doesn&rsquo;t specify the substance of the IPR, but believes it would likely consist of demand-side (e.g. carbon pricing at $54 &ndash; $190/tonne CO2e) and supply-side (e.g. eliminate fossil fuel subsidies) policies, as well as promotion of negative emissions strategies (e.g. sequestration).</p>

<p><strong>Impact on Institutional Investors. </strong>PRI states that as soon as the IPR is announced, it would immediately change how investors value assets and would trigger a period of high volatility until policy and implementation details are determined and analyzed. In general terms, PRI indicates the IPR would rapidly shift capital from high- to low-carbon activities and could result in stranded assets and losses.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations.</strong> PRI believes institutional investors should engage in forward looking scenario and strategic planning to better prepare for transition and mitigate financial losses associated with the IPR. They believe careful attention should be paid to strategic asset allocation, portfolio structure, governance approaches, and risk management responses. Specifically, PRI outlines a framework for integrating IPR transition into <a href=""https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5379""><strong>strategic asset allocation and portfolio construction</strong></a> that investors can use to prepare for the high volatility period that will ensue once the IPR is announced. In addition, PRI prepared a <a href=""https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5380""><strong>list of investor actions in each phase of the IPR</strong></a> (i.e. pre-policy announcement, post-policy announcement, and during implementation).</p>

<p><strong>What is at Stake? <a href=""https://www.eiuperspectives.economist.com/sites/default/files/The%20cost%20of%20inaction_0.pdf"">As stated in a terrific report from The Economist,</a></strong> &ldquo;Regulation has largely failed to confront the risks associated with climate change borne by long-term institutional investors.&rdquo; The report calculated the present value of manageable assets at risk from unchecked climate change, with mean loss to the private sector estimated at $4.2 trillion and mean losses from the societal perspective rising to $13.9 trillion. However, limiting warming to within 2&deg;C (i.e. closing the policy gap) reduces these risk by 50 &ndash; 57%.</p>

<p>You may or may not believe in the IPR theory, but you should appreciate what it represents.</p>

<p>A large international network of long-money (i.e. pension funds, endowments, insurance) not only advocating for, but foreshadowing and framing out preparations for a near-term, large-scale shift towards a low-carbon global economy.</p>

<p>Happy climate month.</p>


",Climate,
Hurricane Florence is the Latest Sign of Our Failure + Enduring Hope,9/26/2018,"<p>Hurricane Florence was a feat of human engineering. It turned into a ferocious killer in a matter of days because we&rsquo;ve warmed the oceans, providing the storm with excessive moisture to supercharge its strength. It brought historic flooding because we&rsquo;ve also warmed the atmosphere, transforming the character of the jet stream and re-writing weather patterns that lead to slow, meandering storms that swell our streams and rivers.</p>

<p>Hurricane Florence follows in the footsteps of Harvey, Sandy, Maria, Matthew, Wilma, Irma, and Katrina, a series of critical, devastating and deadly events, all proving we&rsquo;ve lost our best chance to stop climate change. At the same time, we should remain hopeful that progress toward reducing fossil fuel climate change is nearing an inflection point and while we must now live with a changing climate, we can limit its savagery.</p>

<p>Since NASA scientist James Hansen testified before Congress in 1988 that burning fossil fuels was altering the climate, countless individuals around the world have courageously sought decisive action to stop potentially dangerous changes to our weather and way of life. For 30 years, efforts have been made at all levels of society, the economy, and government to charter a path away from climate catastrophe by building a new, low carbon energy system.</p>

<p>Yet, it&rsquo;s clear we&rsquo;re past the point where we can stop human-made activities from changing the weather, a fact <a href=""https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/8/28/16213268/harvey-climate-change"">North Carolinians </a>won&rsquo;t soon forget. Rather, the goal post has moved as we try to stop locking in increasingly dangerous climate changes for decades and centuries to come. We are also forced to prepare our infrastructure and our communities for the human-charged weather events we have already put into the hopper because of our lack of action.</p>

<p>According to scientists <a href=""http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1934/20"">Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows</a>, industrial nations must peak their carbon emissions by 2020 and cut emissions by 10 percent each year thereafter until we hit zero to avoid a 2 degrees Celsius rise in global temperatures. Doing so is our best chance at avoiding a severe, long-term climate crisis we would not be able to reverse. Over half of our carbon pollution stays in the atmosphere for centuries (unless we invent an effective way to capture it), meaning we&rsquo;ve already dumped so much into it that the only way to stop it is dropping to net-zero as quickly as possible. But, global carbon levels have increased every year since 1988 and show no signs of waning, let alone falling at the deep rates we&rsquo;ll need in a few short years.</p>

<p>Our attempts at changing public policy to reverse this onerous trend have been equally grim. The first attempt at cutting carbon&mdash;the Kyoto Protocol&mdash;failed because industrial countries, like the United States, chose not to ratify the treaty. The latest global treaty attempt&mdash;the Paris Accord&mdash;was dashed by the ascent of climate-denying President Trump. Oil, natural gas, and coal still receive <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/aug/07/fossil-fuel-subsidies-are-a-staggering-5-tn-per-year"">$5 trillion (with a T!) </a>in government-sponsored subsidies every year, including more than <a href=""/News-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidy-Report"">$3 billion per year from Pennsylvania, far more than those supporting renewable energy.</a></p>

<p>While carbon <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=34872"">emissions have decreased 13%</a> in the United States since 2005 (and 16% in Pennsylvania) because of renewable energy deployment, expanding use of natural gas, and coal plant closures, the long-term picture is still dismal. <a href=""https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-environ-110615-085934?journalCode=energy"">By choice, the U.S. is locking</a> in decades of gas plants and pipelines that ensure we will continue emitting carbon from power plants, spewing methane from infrastructure, and perpetuating a political economy around fossil fuels aimed at continuing their operation, no matter how dangerous.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is a prime example of the problems we face trying to stop the root causes of climate change, as we build out dozens of natural gas power plants and <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/pipeline-building-boom/"">4,600 miles of gas pipelines</a>, while providing the <a href=""https://triblive.com/business/headlines/10595729-74/tax-shell-pennsylvania"">red carpet treatment</a> to plastics manufacturers to use the Commonwealth&rsquo;s fracked gas well into the century. Pennsylvania leaders are trying to have it both ways by supporting climate-rotting natural gas at every turn, while occasionally offering weak climate and clean energy policies to goose up voters.</p>

<p>Thirty years since Hansen&rsquo;s clarion call, it&rsquo;s clear that we have failed to stop climate change, but that&rsquo;s not stopping us from ensuring its stay is short. Thousands of governments and corporations, including <a href=""https://www.wearestillin.com/signatories?title=&amp;field_sector_target_id=All&amp;field_public_value=All&amp;field_address_administrative_area=PA&amp;field_location_proximity=25&amp;field_location_proximity-lat=&amp;field_location_proximity-lng=&amp;geolocation_geocoder_google_geocoding_api=&amp;geolocation_geocoder_google_geocoding_api_state=1"">97 entities in Pennsylvania</a>, have joined the We Are Still In movement to pledge continued support for climate action, even if our elected leaders at the highest levels won&rsquo;t. Global investments in clean energy <a href=""https://about.bnef.com/blog/clean-energy-10-predictions-2018/"">have now grown</a> to over $330 billion and renewable energy deployment is far outpacing new fossil fuel generation. <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2018/0427/Even-in-Trump-era-green-energy-innovation-is-sparking-not-sputtering"">New clean energy innovations</a> from our laboratories and universities, as well as those already in the market, are making zero-carbon energy cheaper and more accessible to consumers. The seeds of transformational change are sprouting.</p>

<p>And that is why I&rsquo;m hopeful in the face of overwhelming odds. If Hurricane Florence was manipulated by burning coal and oil for the last century, her future siblings will be born and raised on the backs of fracked natural gas. While I&rsquo;m confident that we will prepare ourselves for their brutal power, I&rsquo;m also optimistic we can buck our past and present failures to make the changes in Pennsylvania and elsewhere so that preparation isn&rsquo;t the only option. It&rsquo;s up to all of us to prioritize climate action in all of the choices we make, including how we vote.</p>

<p>The pieces are in place for significant and sudden climate success. It&rsquo;s not a matter of whether, it&rsquo;s a matter of when, and I&rsquo;m enduringly hopeful that an era of climate action in Pennsylvania and abroad isn&rsquo;t so far away.</p>

"House Bill 2154 Threatens PA Communities, Putting Polluters First",9/25/2018,"<p>We hear frequently about the need to control methane and other dangerous pollutants from natural gas extraction in the Marcellus shale, known as the &ldquo;unconventional&rdquo; gas industry. <strong>These large and deep wells hold the significant potential to release pollutants when things go wrong, but the less talked about &ldquo;conventional gas&rdquo; industry is just as central to the Commonwealth&rsquo;s pollution problems.</strong> Legislators&rsquo; efforts to pretend conventional wells are just the cleaner, smaller cousins of unconventional gas by rolling back environmental protections are dangerous to our communities and based on a false assessment of the industry.</p>

<p>There are over 7,000 large unconventional wells in Pennsylvania, but more than 70,000, smaller, and shallower conventional wells, along with more than 300,000 orphaned and abandoned wells from more than a century of conventional drilling.When it comes to potential pollution, these wells make up for in numbers what they lack in size.</p>

<p><strong>Because there are many more operators drilling many more wells, it can be challenging to regulate the conventional oil and gas industry, but this isn&rsquo;t a problem we can ignore simply because it is difficult to track.</strong>Some of these wells use hydraulic fracturing (fracking) just like their bigger cousins, and many of them are located near homes, schools, streams, parks, and other particularly sensitive areas. </p>

<p>In spite of this, there are forces in the state Legislature that are trying to roll back environmental protections related to these wells. If successful, their plans would put clean air and pure water in jeopardy. <strong><a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/hb2154copy1/index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=6f01befb-fb7e-4c37-8806-0979eb166d56""><u>House Bill 2154, which could be voted on this week in the State Senate,</u></a> essentially sets the requirements on these sources to the levels they were in 1984, rejecting modern advances in technology and instead, allowing these operators to use decades old techniques that pollute more.</strong></p>

<p>Regulating these sources is hard enough already, but House Bill 2154 would take away important tools the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection uses to protect communities. For example, this bill would require DEP to issue warnings in certain cases instead of notices of violation.That is basically telling operators that in many cases, they have a free pass for their first violation, which is potentially dangerous for citizens living in close proximity to these wells. Industry accountability should be prioritized.</p>

<p>This bill also eviscerates bonding requirements.Normally, the DEP requires operators to provide bonds that will fund the state to plug wells if an operator goes out of business or otherwise defaults on its obligations.If this bonding requirement isn&rsquo;t high enough to accomplish the task, we either add to the number of abandoned wells polluting our state or Pennsylvania taxpayers end up paying what the company should have. Instead of ensuring adequate bonding, this bill sets the cost of a bond at $2,500 per well, or a $25,000 &ldquo;blanket bond&rdquo; to cover the entirety of an operator&rsquo;s wells, no matter how many they have.That isn&rsquo;t nearly enough to properly close the wells, so the bill is essentially offering conventional drillers free insurance that Pennsylvania taxpayers would be forced to subsidize.</p>

<p>This bill not only takes power from the DEP, it also hurts land owners. <strong>Once a well is proposed, it gives DEP or the land owners just 15 days to raise objections.</strong>For land owners, that just isn&rsquo;t long enough to learn about a well, hire a qualified expert to review the proposal, then research and develop comments. Instead, this almost guarantees objections will be rushed and not fully developed. The DEP typically gives the public at least 30 days to comment on its actions and in complex cases routinely gives much longer. <strong>It&rsquo;s shocking that the legislature is willing to cut off the public&rsquo;s voice on such an important impact to their land, water, and community.</strong></p>

<p>HB 2154 also attempts to take the power away from municipalities to use their zoning authority to protect their citizens. The PA Supreme Court upheld this right in 2013, finding that the Environmental Rights Amendment of our state Constitution requires the government, including municipalities, to act as a trustee of the our natural resources. Removing this power means not just more pollution, but more pollution in our communities where we live, work, and learn, say nothing of being unconstitutional</p>

<p>While these reasons alone are enough to reject HB 2154, it&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. This bill is bad for all Pennsylvanians. It&rsquo;s shocking that after a century of grappling with the issues brought on by the fossil fuel industry, that elected officials in 2018 would be trying to give communities the tools from 1984 to defend and protect themselves Legislators should resoundingly reject this archaic bill.</p>

Op-Ed: Beaver County Pipeline Explosion: How to Prevent Future Catastrophes,9/23/2018,"<p><a href=""http://www.timesonline.com/opinion/20180920/op-ed-beaver-county-pipeline-explosion-how-to-prevent-future-catastrophes""><em><strong>This blog post originally appeared as an opinion piece in the Sept. 20 edition of the Beaver County Times.</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Residents of Center Township, Beaver County, narrowly avoided a catastrophe on Sept. 10. A newly constructed natural gas pipeline ruptured, causing a terrifying explosion and fire that destroyed a house and several garages and vehicles.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s a great relief that no one was injured, we must still consider what we can do to prevent a similar occurrence, or worse, in the future.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to chalk the explosion up as an accident. The ruptured pipeline was caused by a landslide, an unintentional, chance occurrence. We can&rsquo;t prepare for that. Not true. If office towers can be built in cities prone to earthquakes, pipeline operators can prepare for landslides and minimize their impact.</p>

<p>In this instance, the pipeline owner, Energy Transfer Corporation, had installed the proper erosion and sedimentation controls, but they were not working at the time. That&rsquo;s what Jim Shaner, executive director of the Beaver County Conservation District, the agency responsible for inspecting ETC&rsquo;s pipeline construction procedures, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. So, lax safety practices by ETC, which also owns the problem-plagued Mariner East 2 pipeline, offset the safeguards in place, assuming those &ldquo;safeguards&rdquo; are enough.</p>

<p>But isn&rsquo;t a landslide an act of God? Not much we can do to prevent that. Again, not true. The landslide was caused by intense rains during the previous four days. Experts are attributing the heavy rains and flooding we&rsquo;ve been experiencing this summer to climate change &mdash; an act of man. Furthermore, climate science is signaling a much wetter future for our region, so land saturation and flooding from more frequent and more intense rainfall is coming.</p>

<p>No, this near-disaster cannot be dismissed as an accident or an act of God. The real culprit here is bad public policy and misguided economic development investments. For decades, policymakers of both parties have refused to allocate enough funding to the state agencies responsible for permitting and monitoring pipeline construction, and protecting our health and the environment. Furthermore, investing in gas, and not renewable and clean energy, is shortsighted, reckless and, as the Center Township explosion demonstrates, dangerous.</p>

<p>By failing to take the necessary steps to address climate change, legislators put our communities and climate at risk. Pursuing policies and investments that reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and begin to level the playing field between gas and renewables, such as wind and solar, would unequivocally prevent calamities like the one in Center Township.</p>

<p>The leading environmental organizations in Pennsylvania are fighting to improve current policies. The Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda, an action plan developed by a statewide coalition of more than 25 conservation and environmental groups, contains a number of practical policy solutions for bipartisan bolstering of the state&rsquo;s clean-energy sector, adequately funding the state agencies responsible for protecting the environment and natural resources, achieving environmental justice for the most-vulnerable communities, improving the quality of drinking water and more.</p>

<p>Achieving the policy changes called for here is going to require a groundswell of support from Pennsylvanians. With a pivotal election taking place Nov. 6, we need to take our demands for more enlightened, proactive environmental policies directly to the candidates running for governor and the Legislature. All of us must do our part. Visit <a href=""http://www.greenin18.org"">www.greenin18.org</a> to find out what you can do now to fight for a healthier environment in Pennsylvania.</p>

How Will Climate Change Affect Pennsylvania’s Plants and Animals?,9/20/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Greg Czarnecki, Climate Change and Research Coordinator, PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</strong></em></p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s climate is changing. Average temperatures have increased more than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit since the early 20th century, with even greater increases during the winter. Very heavy rain events and flooding are much more common, and while winters have become wetter, more precipitation is coming as rain and less as snow. These changes are beginning to alter habitats, change natural cycles, and impact the Commonwealth&rsquo;s plants and animals.</p>

<p>As the climate continues to change, plants and animals have three options &ndash; adapt, move, or die.</p>

<p>All living things have an optimal range of climatic conditions in which they can survive and thrive. Some, like white-tailed deer, which are found from Florida to northern Canada, have very broad tolerance ranges. They will just go with the flow and adapt to the changing conditions.</p>

<p>Those that have more narrow tolerance ranges and are mobile will need to move to areas with more favorable conditions, generally to the north or to higher elevations.</p>

<p>This northward movement has occurred many times in our planet&rsquo;s history, most recently when the glaciers retreated during the last ice age. The difference now, however, is the speed with which the climate is changing and the lack of suitable habitat for migration and resettlement due to cities, roads, energy infrastructure, and urban sprawl.</p>

<p>One example of a Pennsylvania species on the move is the black-capped chickadee. This ubiquitous bird is no longer found in the southeast part of Pennsylvania, having been replaced by the Carolina chickadee, a southern species. Scientists have identified a hybridization zone where the ranges of the two birds overlap, which is moving north at about a kilometer per year.</p>

<p>You might not think of them as mobile, but plants can also shift their ranges in response to climate change. While they don&rsquo;t physically move, the geographic range within which their seeds germinate can. <a href=""http://www.docs.dcnr.pa.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_20033655.pdf""><u><strong>In its recently released climate change adaptation plan</strong></u></a>, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources evaluated the likelihood that the Commonwealth&rsquo;s most common trees will continue to flourish across their current range within the state. Among the species not likely to do well are American beech, Paper birch, and Quaking aspen. On the other hand, more southerly species not widely found here now, such as Sweet gum, Shortleaf pine, and American holly, are expected to expand their range within the state.</p>

<p>But not all species will be able to relocate as the climate changes, especially those with specific habitat requirements and a limited ability to move. One of the species that fits those criteria is North America&rsquo;s largest amphibian, the Eastern Hellbender.</p>

<p>The proposed state amphibian is found in medium to large cool water streams containing boulders, flat rocks, and healthy populations of their favorite food &ndash; crayfish. The Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program has conducted <a href=""http://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/CCVI.aspx""><u><strong>climate change vulnerability analyses</strong></u></a> for more than 100 Pennsylvania plants and animals, including the hellbender. They rank it as extremely vulnerable to climate change due to its habitat specificity, limited mobility, increasing water temperatures, limited genetic variation, pressure from amphibian collectors, and a likely significant decrease in suitable habitat by 2050.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are things we can do to reduce the impact of climate change on many of our species. For aquatic species like the hellbender, planting trees along riparian corridors, as is being done by <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/Conservation/Water/RiparianBuffers/Pages/default.aspx""><u><strong>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s buffer initiative</strong></u></a>, can go a long way to cooling water temperatures and improving water quality. For species on the move, identifying and conserving critical migratory pathways will be necessary. And for those that can neither adapt or move, there is always the option of assisted migration. This translocation of a species into new areas of the state, however, should only be undertaken after a stringent scientific analysis of the implications of introducing a species to a new place on the landscape.</p>

"Recent Rollbacks Mean Dirtier Air, Increased Deaths from Pollution",9/18/2018,"<p>Since the Trump administration took over the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), it has talked a lot about its return to its &ldquo;core mission.&rdquo; It even has a whole section on its website devoted to the topic. But, after more than a year, it has become clearer than ever that actually protecting the environment isn&rsquo;t a priority. Instead, the number one mission appears to be its campaign to destroy any progress President Obama made in reducing air pollution and combating climate change.</p>

<p>The first salvo of this campaign targeted the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States, the transportation sector. On Aug. 2, the Trump administration released its proposal to roll back clean vehicle rules that the Obama administration negotiated with automakers. Worse still, this would also withdraw the California waiver so states like Pennsylvania would lose the ability to opt-in to more protective standards for their citizens.</p>

<p>The Trump plan, now called the &ldquo;Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles&rdquo; rule, is clearly a disaster for air quality. Since it does not advance the agency&rsquo;s old &ldquo;core mission&rdquo; of protecting the environment, the EPA has shifted its focus. Our new vehicles will chug out more smog-forming pollutants, cancer-causing particulates, and greenhouse gases, but the EPA claims (with little justification) that those new dirty vehicles will be safer and cheaper.</p>

<p>The Trump EPA&rsquo;s recent attack on clean air is its proposal to repeal the Obama Administration&rsquo;s Clean Power Plan (CPP). If adopted, this new proposal will result in more than 1,400 additional fatalities from air pollution, increase the amount of missed school from students suffering from asthma and lost productivity from the parents who care for them, exacerbate global warming, and end up forcing consumers to pay more for dirtier, more polluting energy. In spite of that, the Trump administration decided to call it the &ldquo;Affordable Clean Energy&rdquo; rule (ACE).</p>

<p>The CPP was built around section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), which requires existing power plants to use the &ldquo;best system of emissions reductions&rdquo; (BSER) that, after considering costs, health benefits, and energy requirements, has been adequately demonstrated. The Obama-era EPA did a comprehensive analysis and set state-by-state emissions standards that were presumptively BSER. It then tasked state governors to submit plans on how to meet those standards. Overall, this would result in an 870 million tons reduction in carbon pollution and have net benefits between $26 and $45 billion. In Pennsylvania, this would only take a modest step forward. We were about halfway to our target by the time the rule was proposed and had a number of cost-effective options to move forward.</p>

<p>The current ACE plan being proposed throws out the old rule, sacrificing $23 to $42 billion in net benefits for what the Trump administration claims is a $6 billion reduction in compliance costs. It concludes that this bad deal for consumers is really the &ldquo;best system of emissions reductions&rdquo; because it ignores that the power grid is highly interconnected. Instead, the EPA redefines BSER to only include minor tune-ups and other efficiencies that can be adopted at each individual facility, even if much cheaper reductions are available elsewhere. It also creates much more work for state environmental agencies by throwing out presumptive BSER levels and forcing states to start from scratch.</p>

<p>The companies that own coal-fired power plants support this new plan, but even they admit that they just aren&rsquo;t competitive in todays market and ACE isn&rsquo;t going to make much of a difference as to whether they stay in operation or retire. In fact, just days after the EPA released this proposal, First Energy announced its money-losing Bruce Mansfield plant--the largest coal-fired power plant in Pennsylvania--will close in 2021 unless the federal government steps in and forces consumers to pay higher electricity bills to bail them out.</p>

<p>We are being told that such a bail out is necessary because retiring coal plants are a threat to grid reliability. This simply isn&rsquo;t the case. If a power plant slated for retirement is actually needed, it can be designated as a reliability must-run (RMR) unit and be compensated accordingly on a temporary basis until system improvements can be completed and it can retire.</p>

<p>There reality though is that with competition from cheaper natural gas and growth in clean renewable generation, these coal plants just aren&rsquo;t necessary. It&rsquo;s no surprise that no new coal plants are expected to be built in Pennsylvania and retirements of existing plants will continue. The five other large (&gt; 1GW) coal plants in Pennsylvania besides Bruce Mansfield are all 40 to to 50 years old and are nearing retirement. At least one of those plants, Brunner Island, is in the process of converting to natural gas, and others have admitted financial trouble. In spite of this, The EPA is claiming that ACE will result in a 4.5 to 5.8 percent increase in coal use--an obvious lie.</p>

<p>Just because ACE won&rsquo;t make much difference for the coal industry doesn&rsquo;t mean the administration has given up on a coal bail-out. A top Trump-appointee at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) recently said that they are working to identify plants they consider &ldquo;critical&rdquo; and find a way to &ldquo;value&rdquo; them. This follows a proposal from the Department of Energy last year asking FERC to &ldquo;value&rdquo; plants with more than 90-days of fuel on site (e.g. coal) in the name of &ldquo;resilience.&rdquo; In both of these cases, the word &ldquo;value&rdquo; means the same thing--it means forcing consumers like you to pay extra for dirty power that you don&rsquo;t want or need.</p>

How Artists Interpret Climate Change & Raise Awareness,9/13/2018,"<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/IMG%5F1471%2EJPG"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p>Recently, I was invited to be a judge of an art competition presented by the Whitaker Center in Harrisburg. It was their &ldquo;Summerscapes Upcycled Pizza Box Contest,&rdquo; in which artists of all ages used repurposed pizza boxes as their canvases to express their favorite summer moments. Many of the artists used &ldquo;recycled&rdquo; materials to create outdoor scenes to show what the they were paying attention to recently.</p>

<p>Because that is what artists do - they notice something &mdash; it could be a shape, a color, an idea, a moment, a person&mdash;and they pay attention to it. When they make their painting (or photograph, sculpture, play, story, dance, or music) they are asking us to pay attention to what they noticed as well.</p>

<p>Five months ago, I took the position of Director of Development for PennFuture. Before that, much of my career was in the arts. What I&rsquo;ve been noticing during the past five months is how much intersection there is between these two paths. There are a lot of artistsof all typeswho are creating works that ask us to pay attention to the environment and climate change.</p>

<p><strong>I should have noticed this before, but isn&rsquo;t that what most of us say about climate change? </strong>My wife is a photographer and has been creating digital compositions with climate change themes for a few years now. I knew that she was paying attention to the issue, but were other artists?</p>

<p>To find my answer, I first visited the <a href=""https://artistsandclimatechange.com/"">&ldquo;Artists and Climate Change&rdquo; website</a>.It was created to encourage artists to create art, plays, books, operas, and more that go beyond the scientific facts of climate and engage people in the reality of its impact on our lives. Sometimes, the issueof climate change feels so big that it almost seems impossible to act. By encouraging and connecting individual artists to address this, the hope is that this huge issue can be broken down into &ldquo;small personal components.&rdquo; The quantityand varietyof work being shared is inspiring. I have been personally moved by the work of <a href=""http://www.joansullivanphotography.com/"">&ldquo;renewable energy photographer&rdquo; Joan Sullivan.</a></p>

<p><strong>It turns out that many artists are paying attention and trying to do something.</strong> One of the most effective groups has been the <a href=""http://landartgenerator.org/"">Land Art Generator Initiative</a>, an international collectivebased in Pittsburgh, that for almost ten years has been connecting artists, architects, engineers, scientists, and local communities to create public art that somehow generates sustainable energy. A great example of this is <a href=""http://www.artenergycamp.org/"">Pittsburgh&rsquo;s &ldquo;Renaissance Gate</a>,&quot; which was developed by 20 children&mdash;ranging in age from 8 to 17&mdash;from the Homewood neighborhood during a 2015 LAG summer camp. The solar artwork now provides energy to the neighborhood they live in.</p>

<p>This past summer, the artist Mel Chin created a &ldquo;mixed reality&rdquo; installation which allowed visitors in Times Square to &ldquo;experience&rdquo; what the tourist spot will look like when it becomes completely submerged by rising sea levels due to climate change. Looking up from &ldquo;under water&rdquo; through special Virtual Reality head-sets, users could see everything going on around them in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; and also see the bottoms of numerous boats and ships floating 26 feet above their heads. <a href=""https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/mel-chin-confronts-climate-change-times-square-virtual-reality-artwork-1317413#.W09UPQHT1iM.email"">The work is no longer in Times Square, but can be viewed through an app.</a></p>

<p>Many of the temporary sculptures and installations created for this year&rsquo;s recent Burning Man festival in the Nevada dessert had an environmental theme as well. Perhaps the most poignant was a 36 foot tall sculpture of a polar bear made by Don Kennell &amp; Lisa Adler out of over 100 repurposed car hoods. <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/long-view-a-polar-bear-stands-in-the-desert#/"">They will be touring this &ldquo;icon for global warming&rdquo; across the country in the coming months.</a></p>

<p>Not all work though is just about paying attention or generating energy. Artists are also taking action to prevent climate change. Miami Beach, where sea level rise is already a reality, launched a new artist in residence program last April at the Art Center of South Florida to spend a year exploring climate change - and trying to see what artists can do to prevent it. <a href=""https://news.artnet.com/art-world/miami-beach-artist-residency-rising-sea-levels-1306526#.WzPct5GwG20.email"">Artist and South Florida native Misael Soto was selected to spend the year meeting with city officials to learn and discover what artists can do to have an actual impact on the environment.</a></p>

<p><strong>Can artists truly prevent climate change?</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but at least some are trying. As Jacquelyn Bonomo, PennFuture President and CEO, writes in her recent blog, with the scale of the climate problem we face, what we are doing right now is simply not enough. More must be done, and we all must take responsibility for doing something.</p>

<p>Dr. Michael Mann, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State and PennFuture Board Member tweets: &ldquo;Follow your heart. Climate change and environmental sustainability impacts every sector of civilization and every facet of our lives. Do what youre good at and enjoy doing and finding a way to change the world for the better while youre doing it.&rdquo;</p>

Of Floods and our Future,9/10/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Larry J. Schweiger, President Emeritus, PennFuture</strong></em></p>

<p>Pennsylvania has a history of floods but none like what we are experiencing today. The earliest floods recorded in 1786, 1810 and 1820 were called &quot;pumpkin floods&quot; because native Americans grew their pumpkins along rich floodplain soils. During fall hurricanes, pumpkins were swept into the rivers.</p>

<p>Later, loggers destroyed the virgin forests and fires burned. Passing storms and denuded mountainsides caused rapid runoff and flooded communities. The connection between denuded mountainsides and floods was clear in 1895 when Dr. Joseph Rothrock was hired as the first forestry commissioner to acquire and restore damaged forests. Rothrock warned, &quot;Unless we reforest, Pennsylvanias highlands will wash into the oceans.&rdquo; The Commonwealth purchased the worst of the denuded lands from lumber companies, creating many state forests.</p>

<p>Today, the pumpkins are gone and the hillsides are reforested, but cars are being washed away during unprecedented &quot;rain bomb&quot; events. The dramatic and unprecedented uptick in floods from superstorms and hurricanes is an early warning sign of what is coming our way in terms of the many impacts of climate change. Why are we experiencing increasing storms with record-breaking rainfall?</p>

<p>Simply put, our lawmakers have ignored scientific warnings for many decades, and now we are entering what will be a time for consequences. Yet, daily, humans continue to dump 110 million tons of heat-trapping pollution into the sky. It turns out that 93 percent of the energy trapped by carbon dioxide, methane, and other pollutants is channeled into the oceans. Warmer waters pump vast amounts of moisture into the skies. Heat equivalent to a staggering 400,000 Hiroshima-scale bombs is added to the oceans each and every day. Overheated waters produce elevated storm intensities.</p>

<p>Every corner of the world is experiencing the consequences of climate change. The American West has been overheated, drying out and catching on fire. The California firefighters painfully understand the results of our failure to end the burning of fossil fuels. The waters of the Gulf of Mexico and of the Caribbean dont flush well and are particularly vulnerable to overheating. From Hurricanes Katrina, Maria, and Harvey, Gulf Coast communities and our island territories have experienced unprecedented storms on steroids from hurricanes passing over overheated water.</p>

<p>The Northeast, including Pennsylvania, is increasingly vulnerable as the Gulf Stream warms and slows down. Let us not forget Superstorm Sandy or a much earlier Hurricane Agnes that destroyed 68,000 homes and ruined 3,000 businesses. On August 17th, Governor Tom Wolf signed a disaster emergency proclamation in response to a series of severe rainstorms up to ten inches in some areas that triggered damage to homes and businesses throughout much of north and central portions of the state. It was the second time in 2018 that the Governor declared a state of emergency as a massive snowstorm battered Eastern Pennsylvania and brought down thousands of trees and destroyed homes and businesses in the Poconos. Paradoxically, climate change can trigger more significant snowstorms as well as more winter rainfall.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh&rsquo;s February weather was a record breaker, including the warmest February day on record with temperatures nearly 40 degrees above normal and a 7&rdquo; month-long rainfall record. Saturated soils initiated mudslides in Duquesne Heights, Babcock Boulevard, Garfield, Spring Hill and Route 30 just to name a few of the dozens of massive landslides that occurred locally in 2018.</p>

<p>The 1977 Johnstown flood is the kind of flood pattern we must fear. The storm just hung over the hills above Johnstown and caused 76 deaths, leaving $330 million in property damage. We are experiencing similar intense, often nearly-stationary &ldquo;rain bombs&rdquo; triggering flash-floods, mudslides overwhelming towns and roadways. When increased atmospheric water vapor combines with a disrupted and wavier Jetstream, strong storms can be held in place longer. A 4th of July storm hovered over Fox Chapel, OHara Township and Aspinwall, flooding streets and bringing down trees and power lines. Twice in one week, the Delafield Road-Freeport Road area suffered substantial damage.</p>

<p><strong>What must we do to protect our communities from the ravages of floods?</strong>First, we must shut off the spigot of pollution by demanding that Congress overcome fossil-fuels powerful grip and put a price on carbon emissions to quickly move our economy to carbon-free energy. Lawmakers must also incentivize efficient homes, cars, and businesses, cutting the demand for such fuels.</p>

<p>Second, historical 100-year floods are no longer a relevant land planning standard. Federal flood maps can&rsquo;t keep up with growing flood risks and must be redrawn based on climate modeling. Stormwater infrastructure must also be built with more significant storms in mind. Banks must say no to flawed construction in places with unstable slopes or flood-prone hazards. All new land developments must be required to hold much more runoff.</p>

<p>Third, to address the relentless mega-storms and multi-billion-dollar floods, the Federal Flood Insurance Program must be updated with rates that reflect the real costs of the risks and include all areas that are now vulnerable.</p>

<p>Finally, climate disruption is a relentless feature in our world, but we must work together to avoid the worst that will inevitably come if we continue to ignore the connection between pollution and destructive climatic forces. Lets put aside every political difference and work together to protect our childrens future.</p>

The Urgency of Climate Change + Opportunities to Take Action,9/4/2018,"<p><strong>PennFuture marks September as Climate Month, along with communities around the state, nation, and world. Over the course of the next few weeks, we will provide you with blogs, events and a webinar that focus on and explore all aspects of climate change and its impact on Pennsylvania.</strong>On one hand, it&rsquo;s a somber moment as we watch the modest policy progress made over the last decade evaporate at the national level and Pennsylvania welcome natural gas, coal, and petrochemicals with open arms. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s a moment of clarity as we recognize that the time for incremental changes, multi-decade solutions, and tinkering around the edges, if there ever was one, is over.</p>

<p><a href=""https://grist.org/climate-energy/what-would-wartime-mobilization-to-fight-climate-change-look-like/""><strong>As climate writer Dave Roberts puts it</strong></a>, the scale and speed at which we need to address climate change is nothing less than a &ldquo;war-time mobilization.&rdquo; Our country&rsquo;s most esteemed scientists, many of whom teach and live in Pennsylvania, have been ringing the alarm for decades that human activity is fundamentally changing the chemistry of the atmosphere. In our own communities and families, we have undoubtedly seen a heartbreaking increase in the frequency of Lyme disease, occurrences of asthma, and destruction caused by climate-fueled weather events. As Pennsylvania&rsquo;s scientists note, none of this can be explained away by anything other than the fact nature around us is changing&hellip;rapidly.</p>

<p>I recently met with several of PennFuture&rsquo;s most steadfast friends, who suggested that a climate equivalent of Pearl Harbor was needed to wake people up to the climate crisis. We simply cannot wait for another focusing moment to occur, as if Hurricane Florence, Superstorm Sandy, California wildfires, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Irma, Midwest flooding and severe weather outbreaks, and western drought aren&rsquo;t enough. We are in the midst of such peril&mdash;as I sometimes like to put it, we are &ldquo;fiddling while Rome burns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Washington, D.C., the Obama administration&rsquo;s response to the climate crisis&mdash;the Paris Climate Accord, the Clean Power Plan and vehicle efficiency standards&mdash;has been replaced by the Trump administration&rsquo;s plan to rollback vehicle emission standards, boost the use of coal, and expand drilling in our oceans and forest lands. It&rsquo;s a coordinated attack on our wellbeing by corporate right unraveling our air, water, and climate protections to squeeze out another ounce of profit on the backs of our public health. </p>

<p>The policy situation here in Pennsylvania isn&rsquo;t much better. We&rsquo;ve rolled out a red carpet for Shell Global&rsquo;s cracker plant in western Pennsylvania with a $1.62 billion subsidy from tax payers. Our economic development officials continue to tout Pennsylvania as the next big boom for the petrochemical and plastics industry. We&rsquo;ve lent a helping subsidy to coal by reopening mines in the anthracite region, and they celebrate the opening of new metallurgic mines in the southwest part of the state. Like I said: fiddling while Rome burns.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say Pennsylvania isn&rsquo;t doing anything positive in the realm of creating solutions to the climate crisis. I&rsquo;m supportive of the $2,000 rebate program for alternative fuel vehicles just announced by the PA Department of Environmental Protection. The state recently implemented its first ever methane controls on new oil and gas infrastructure. The state is beginning to force bad actors to plug abandoned and leaking gas wells. We just passed Commercial PACE legislation that opens new opportunities for commercial building owners to lower their energy consumption and bills. And Governor Wolf is staunchly condemning Trump&rsquo;s abandonment of clean car standards. <strong>All of these policy choices matter, but with the scale of the climate problem we face, it&rsquo;s simply not enough.</strong></p>

<p>We have a political problem here in Pennsylvania, as we do nationally. Climate change is running well out ahead of us and we are losing our chance to act decisively and significantly. We are dragging our feet on the policy decisions that will actually make a dent in the problem: state methane regulations for existing oil and gas infrastructure, eliminating subsidies for oil, coal, and natural gas, investing significantly in next-generation renewable energy technologies, aggressively updating Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, and implementing carbon pricing.</p>

<p>This shortsightedness&mdash;especially the blindness of our policy officials to the economic opportunity of investing in renewable energy&mdash;will not only dig us a climate hole we may not be able to escape from, but also put the Commonwealth at an economic disadvantage for decades to come while saddling our citizens with the health and environmental impacts of these misguided investments in gas and coal.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the fight must go on and there is important work being done to overcome the stranglehold the fossil fuel industry has over the Commonwealth&rsquo;s climate and energy policy and implement the type of wartime mobilization we need. I am proud of a new program being developed by PennFuture called Clean Energy Communities. Being piloted in Pittsburgh, the program is working with communities and their elected officials to take ownership of their climate future and advance renewable energy in their municipalities and reduce their carbon footprint. Our expectation is to expand this program around the state as there are hundreds of local communities that have overwhelmingly expressed their determination to meet carbon reduction goals, with or without state or federal action.</p>

<p>PennFuture is also working with the PA DEP and over 500 stakeholders on the Finding PA&rsquo;s Solar Future project. The goal of the project is to model scenarios for increasing solar energy deployment in Pennsylvania and to discuss the best pathways for doing so. PennFuture has convened stakeholder meetings, engaged with thought leaders, and is helping organize a statewide report on the potential for solar energy moving forward.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is tremendous energy around this election cycle&mdash;I feel it everywhere. More and more citizens are tired of getting their health, clean water, and air quality thrown under the proverbial bus through the guise of &ldquo;smaller government&rdquo; or &ldquo;cutting red tape.&rdquo; Through PennFuture&rsquo;s civic engagement program, we&rsquo;re elevating the public debate on environmental issues around the Commonwealth and engaging in nonpartisan voter education ahead of November 6th. I am so proud of the work being done by our partner organization, Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, as they shine a spotlight how well or not our elected officials are doing on environmental legislation and votes. <a href=""https://www.conservationpa.org/scorecard""><strong>They recently published its 2017 &ndash; 18 legislative scorecard and you should take a look.</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Without a doubt, more needs to be done and PennFuture will continue to build out its climate programming to continue matching the monumental task ahead. </strong>We hope that you&mdash;our supporters, readers, and the general public&mdash;will join in the discussion on how best to do this in Pennsylvania. During climate month, PennFuture is hosting a number of events around the Commonwealth to advance climate protections. I hope you&rsquo;ll be able to join us. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/events""><strong>Click here to visit our events page to get involved.</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>In closing, I believe that Climate Month is no longer a time to raise general awareness on climate or calling for simply any action. Rather, it&rsquo;s now a moment to note what we realistically have to do, no matter how much of an uphill battle it may seem from the outset. </strong>We&rsquo;ve moved past the need for small policy changes and into an era where immediate and urgent mobilization is all we have left to meet this challenge. I want to personally thank all of those who are trying every day in the public&rsquo;s service to overcome this climate challenge. I&rsquo;m sure there have been many moments in the last couple of years where it seems hopeless, but we can&rsquo;t relent. Together, let&rsquo;s keep going.</p>

Monroe County College Campus Journeys to Clean Energy and Efficiency,8/29/2018,"<div>The Monroe Campus of Northampton Community College in the Poconos strikes gold and more on an environmental journey.</div>

<div></div>

<div>LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, as designated by the U.S. Green Building Council, is more than a symbol of excellence in green building. It represents a standard of environmental stewardship that succeeds in &ldquo;acting on the triple bottom line - putting people, planet and profit first.&rdquo;</div>

<div></div>

<div>While Northampton Community College (NCC) is celebrating its 30th year in Monroe County, it was just over 10 years ago that NCC held a &ldquo;Monroe Dream Session&rdquo; with its faculty and staff, board of trustees and students to formulate a vision for a new campus that would serve all of Monroe County. One of the most important parts of the vision was that the new campus would become an example of responsible environmental stewardship whether it ended up becoming silver, gold or platinum LEED.</div>

<div></div>

<div>In December 2015, NCC had a special ceremony on campus to announce that it had indeed met the goal of becoming LEED Gold as certified by the U.S Green Building Council. But that certification did not happen easily &ndash; nor did it happen as originally planned. As with all big vision projects, it took time to get things started. There were zigs and zags, and an economic downturn in 2008 that almost derailed the entire project. It took a lot of passion and dedication by many to stay the course to complete the current campus in Monroe County that is so valued by the students and faculty.</div>

<div></div>

<div>I was privileged to speak with Matt Connell, Dean of the Monroe Campus of NCC for the past 24 years, about the journey that took the NCC &ndash; Monroe campus from more humble college grounds by renting high school buildings all the way to Gold LEED building status.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Back in 1998, I learned that NCC was selling off an old campus and then utilized high school buildings and the local Chamber of Commerce site as classrooms in the evening for their students &ndash; approximately 600 of them! They also rented space in downtown Stroudsburg for a couple of years until they decided they needed a more permanent location. As Dean Connell says, they bought what was then an old blouse factory in Tannersville &ndash; right off of 611 &ndash; and it became as he would lovingly call it, &ldquo;A 10,000 square foot one room schoolhouse &ndash; a couple of classrooms, computer labs and some snack machines.&rdquo; NCC added some modular trailers to increase its capacity as its enrollment grew.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Incredibly, NCC went through two phases of expansion at that original campus and eventually grew to a 40,000 square foot facility campus to accommodate up to 2,200 students through 2002. But NCC really needed to add more space. The original campus, while it had classrooms, science labs and some administrative offices with a small library had, according to Connell, &ldquo;NO Student space. The campus lacked all of the amenities that students look for when they come to a college campus.&rdquo; But, he said all of those shortcomings at a commuter campus really spurred them on to add to the student space that is now in existence on their campus. He said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what led to the Dream Day.&rdquo;</div>

<div></div>

<div>When I asked about how NCC was able to engage the local Monroe community to help the project move forward financially, Connell said it was more of a yin and yang experience at the beginning. While NCC did seek support from the local community in a couple of different ways, because of the market forces happening with the collapse of the housing market in 2008, there were different schools of thought as to what the community could do. Connell stated that three years ago, folks in the banking field shared information with him &ldquo;that showed Monroe County took it on the chin more than once when the housing market crashed. He added, &ldquo;Real estate taxes in Monroe County are some of the highest in the state.&rdquo;</div>

<div></div>

<div>The dean indicated that the market force essentially galvanized a lot of folks in the community to say,  &rdquo;We&rsquo;re already paying school taxes, we&rsquo;re not going to take on another tax to support a community college, so &ndash; again, it wasn&rsquo;t the purpose of what we were doing, it was more their engagement with it. In many ways, it was just poor timing!&rdquo;</div>

<div></div>

<div>When I asked the dean what came out of the construction process that was notable for him, he replied that while he has spoken about how important it was for NCC &ndash; Monroe Campus to get the LEED certification, one of the things that impressed him personally and professionally, as the construction process took place, was learning that 80 percent of the waste generated in the construction of this campus was recycled. &ldquo;And I did not realize that was part of the LEED certification &ndash; so that was really impressive,&rdquo; he said.</div>

<div></div>

<div>He added that &ldquo;a key part of minimum LEED certification was that the delivery of materials and supplies and equipment to build and equip this campus could come only from a radius of a certain distance because of minimizing the impact on the environment with exhaust emissions from all vehicles that were bringing materials and equipment to build the campus.&rdquo;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Having toured the campus this past spring, I can say that everything about this campus has been designed for energy efficiency and sustainability. It is what you would call a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; school with all energy use constantly monitored and adjusted by computer to maximize clean energy efficiency.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>The NCC Monroe campus Environmental Fact sheet shows they now have:</strong></div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Solar Voltaic System</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>2090 solar panels producing 637 kW of power</li>
	<li>Provides about 40% of the campus annual electric needs</li>
	<li>Generates over 700,000 kWh per year, or enough electricity to power 70 homes</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Campus HVAC Management System</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Trane Tracer Computerized Energy Management System</li>
	<li>Monitors and Controls over 4,000 points through out the campus</li>
	<li>Saves over 660,000 kWh per year, or enough electricity to power 60 homes.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Campus Lighting Management System</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Lutron Computerized Lighting Management System</li>
	<li>Monitors and controls over 10,000 lights throughout the campus</li>
	<li>Saves over 450,000 kWh per year, or enough electricity to power 45 homes</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Geothermal Heating and Cooling System</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>164 wells that are 450 feet deep</li>
	<li>Closed loop, meaning water is recirculated, not extracted from the ground</li>
	<li>Provides 100% of the campus heating and cooling needs</li>
	<li>Saves over 200,000 kWh per year, or enough electricity to power 20 homes.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Wind Turbine System</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>10kW Bergey wind turbine on an 80 ft tower</li>
	<li>Started operation April 2016</li>
	<li>Expected to generate over11,200kW per year</li>
</ul>

<div></div>

<div>I asked the Dean what challenges lay ahead for the college now that the GOLD certification is complete and has been operating for awhile. He said that while they are proud that they have the full package that is having a positive impact on the environment, they have more to do.</div>

<div></div>

<div>&ldquo;From a systems point of view, everything is operating as it should be on the solar panel system, on the geothermal wells, on the lighting, heating and cooling. Everything is working as it should be. With mechanical systems, you are always going to have breakdowns and things, so that part is working well. From a programmatic point of view, the thing we must do as a college now is figure out how to access and leverage all of the resources that we have at this GOLD LEED certified campus and convert it into an educational program that prepares individuals to be able to manage future LEED certified programs and campuses or buildings,&rdquo; he said.</div>

<div></div>

<div>&ldquo;In our minds, there will be a number of these projects taking place over the next 10 or 15 years, and each one will build upon and learn from the previous project. But they&rsquo;ll need trained individuals to manage those complex operations daily &ndash; and leverage and maximize the ability of those places to limit impact on the environment. Our next step is to figure out how to convert that to a credential that is marketable and those individuals employed in that field. That will be a growing field over the next 10 or 15 years.&rdquo;</div>

<div>As to what the Dean hopes for the future of the college, he says that the legacy of the institution always looks to leave is one of, &rdquo;We did everything we could as an institution to help students succeed and achieve the dreams and goals that they have whether it&rsquo;s with one class or degree &ndash; and we did everything we could using the high touch, high tech approach that really engages students in meaningful ways, and in doing so, helped them gain confidence and help them recognize that they can achieve a number of things that they were not always sure about before they got to us.&rdquo;</div>

<div></div>

<div>NC Monroe County has certainly struck GOLD with more than their LEED building. Their accountability on environmental impacts is impressive and they are taking the next steps to grow leaders in this field.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Thank you to the NCC Board of Trustees, faculty and students and Dean Connell who started the &ldquo;dream day&rdquo; and made it happen in Monroe County!</div>

"Clean Water Rule Revived in PA, Protecting Our Headwater Streams and Wetlands",8/22/2018,"<p>Last week, a federal district court in South Carolina threw out the Trump Administration&rsquo;s unlawful attempt to delay the effective date of the Clean Water Rule &ndash; which was enacted in 2015 &ndash; resulting in its reestablishment in Pennsylvania and 25 other states.</p>

<p>The 2015 Clean Water Rule is a scientifically-supported rule, in line with the purpose of the federal Clean Water Act, that protects sensitive and critical headwaters and wetlands, which in turn protects the water quality for thousands of steam miles in the Commonwealth and the drinking water supplies used by millions of Pennsylvanians.PennFuture supports the Clean Water Rule and its clear protections of our waters, which provide further benefits to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s outdoor recreational economy as well as communities and small businesses.</p>

<p><u><strong>Background</strong></u><br />
The Clean Water Rule was promulgated on August 28, 2015 to clarify the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; under the federal Clean Water Act.It notably extended clean water protections for small, intermittent and ephemeral streams and wetlands that had a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; to traditionally navigable waters. The Clean Water Rule was based on the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; as described by Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy&rsquo;s concurring opinion in <em>Rapanos v. United States</em>, 547 U.S. 715 (2006), which protected any waters that had a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; to navigable streams.</p>

<p>Upon taking office in 2017, President Trump took aim at the Clean Water Rule and directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers to rescind the Rule and replace it with a new, more limiting definition consistent with the late-Justice Anthony Scalia&rsquo;s majority &ldquo;continuing surface water connection&rdquo; opinion in <em>Rapanos</em>.</p>

<p>In July 2017, the Trump Administration proposed to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule. The agencies received over 685,000 public comments on the proposed repeal, with the majority of the comments (over 500,000) opposing the repeal of the Clean Water Rule. (<a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2017-09-27-PennFuture-Clean-Water-Rule-Repeal-Public-Comments-%28EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203%29.pdf"">Read PennFuture&rsquo;s comments here.</a>)This repeal rule has not been finalized, and no replacement rule has yet been proposed.</p>

<p>Apparently concerned that its proposed repeal would not withstand judicial scrutiny, the Trump Administration in November 2017 concocted a proposed rule that would add a new &ldquo;applicability date&rdquo; to the Clean Water Rule in an attempt to essentially override the August 28, 2015 effective date of the Rule.Over 4,500 public comments were submitted (<a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2017-12-13-PennFuture-Clean-Water-Rule-Applicability-Date-Public-Comments-%28EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0644.%29.pdf"">read PennFuture&rsquo;s comments here</a>), and on January 31, 2018, the Trump Administration finalized the &ldquo;Delay Rule&rdquo; such that the 2015 Clean Water Rule would not be effective until February 6, 2020.</p>

<p>Numerous lawsuits challenging the Delay Rule were filed across the country.One of these lawsuits, filed in the federal District Court of South Carolina, argued that the Trump Administration failed to follow the procedural rules set forth in the federal Administrative Procedures Act (APA) in promulgating the Delay Rule. On August 16, 2018, <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2018-08-16-South-Carolina-Dist.-%28SELC%29.pdf""><strong>the District Court agreed, and imposed a nationwide injunction on the Delay Rule.</strong></a></p>

<p>Because of this ruling, the Clean Water Rule has been reinstated in the following 26 states, pending finalization of the proposed repeal rule: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. (For the remaining 24states, two courts had previously enjoined the Clean Water Rule from taking effect, and thus the South Carolina injunction on the Delay Rule does not impact the status of the Clean Water Rule in those states.)</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture has long-supported the Clean Water Rule and its protection of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s critical headwater streams and wetlands.We will continue to vocalize our support for the Clean Water Rule, and will keep you informed of any updates in this ongoing battle.</strong></p>

<p>9/12/18 UPDATE:Yesterday, a federal court in Texas blocked the implementation of the Clean Water Rule in three southern states (Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana), but stopped short on issuing a nationwide injunction on the Clean Water Rule. Consequently, the Clean Water Rule is now in effect in 23 states, including Pennsylvania.</p>

Trump's Proposed Car Emissions Rollback Would Prevent States from Protecting Citizens,8/21/2018,"<p><a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2018/08/trumps_proposed_car_emissions.html""><em><strong>This blog post originally appeared as an opinion piece published in Harrisburgs PennLive on Aug. 11.</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Transportation emissions now surpass electric generation as the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States. But with millions of gas guzzling vehicles on the road and car culture so ingrained in society, reducing these emissions is difficult. To continue addressing this complicated problem, President Barack Obama worked with automakers in 2012 to negotiate a cost-effective increase in vehicle efficiency standards that would cut carbon and reduce gasoline consumption, while keeping our automobile industry competitive.</p>

<p>The automakers agreed with the new efficiency standards at the time, but they have seen an opportunity to cut a new deal under the Trump Administration. Trump quickly acquiesced to the automakers&rsquo; requests, and his EPA has rushed out a proposed rollback under the Orwellian title, &ldquo;The Safer and Affordable Fuel Efficient Vehicles Proposed Rule for Model Years 2021-2026.&rdquo; This new regulation would freeze federal fuel economy standards at 2020 levels and keep states from protecting their citizens with higher standards.</p>

<p>Unbelievably, this rollback goes well beyond what the automakers initially asked for. Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company recently said they &ldquo;support increasing clean car standards through 2025 and are not asking for a rollback.&rdquo; He went on to say that Ford &ldquo;believe[s] we must deliver on CO2 reductions consistent with the Paris Climate Accord.&rdquo; What the automakers wanted was some added flexibility in compliance, but what they got was a ham-fisted attempt at eliminating agreed-to standards that would have led to affordable cars that are the cleanest in our automakers&rsquo; history.</p>

<p>This new move is impossible to justify along any economic, public health, good governance, engineering, or scientific lines of argument. The EPA already determined in 2017 that existing standards are achievable by the auto industry and the technologies to meet the standards already exist -- the European Union requires even higher standards. We also know that repealing the standards will result in lower gas mileage that could cost drivers more than $2,000 at the pump over the life of their vehicles. The Trump plan will also increase foreign imports of oil by millions of gallons, add millions of tons of carbon pollution to the air, and increase asthma-causing and smog-forming pollutants.</p>

<p>EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation Bill Wehrum gives a tortured justification for this action. He claims that not having to meet new pollution standards will save the automakers money. He then assumes that automakers will pass the savings on to consumers; that the savings will make enough difference that people will buy newer and safer cars; and, safer cars will, in turn, mean fewer fatalities in car accidents. So, he argues, we have to make drivers pay more at the pump, import more foreign oil, and damage the environment for &ldquo;safety&rdquo; reasons. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who is one of 19 state attorneys general who have announced that they will challenge this action, put it plainly saying, &ldquo;The data and science do not back up what they&rsquo;re trying to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attorney General Shapiro is right to challenge this regulation. The Commonwealth has long since opted to protect its citizens and the environment with fuel efficiency standards that are stronger than the minimum federal requirements--this new rule takes away that option. Instead, we will be forced to accept a one-size-fits-all federal rule that assumes our automakers can&rsquo;t make cars as clean and efficient as other countries are already making.</p>

<p>States normally have significant authority to regulate pollution inside their borders, but there are cases where federal law prohibits states from creating their own rules. Almost everyone agrees that forcing auto manufacturers to create different versions of each model-year car to comply with up to 50 different state fuel efficiency rules would be expensive and create logistical problems. So, when Congress passed the Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act in 1965, it added Section 209 to the Clean Air Act (CAA) that typically prevents states from creating their own vehicle emissions standards.</p>

<p>There is one important exception though: California was already regulating vehicle emissions before the EPA, so the CAA doesn&rsquo;t take that power away. Instead, if California determines that their standards are at least as stringent as the federal standards; the EPA is obligated to waive Section 209 unless it has an acceptable reason not to. Once California receives that waiver, other states like Pennsylvania can legally opt-in to California&rsquo;s standards--that is what Pennsylvania, along with thirteen other states and the District of Columbia, have done.</p>

<p>Everyone would probably prefer a single national standard, and the Obama administration&rsquo;s emissions guidelines were a major step in that direction, but not all states face the same problems. Pennsylvania, with more than 100 billion miles of vehicle travel every year, has more than 20 times the vehicle usage than a state like Alaska. We also have many more citizens living in communities with poor air quality. It makes sense that states like Pennsylvania have the right to adopt more stringent standards to protect their citizens, and that&rsquo;s just what we did.</p>

<p>If the Trump administration succeeds in withdrawing the California waiver, that also takes the choice away from Pennsylvania. Not only is the President not listening to the auto manufacturers, he&rsquo;s also ignoring the needs of our communities.</p>

Exceptional Waters Define the Poconos & Deserve Protection,8/21/2018,"<p><a href=""http://www.poconorecord.com/opinion/20180815/my-turn-exceptional-waters-define-poconos-and-deserve-protection""><em><strong>This blog post originally appeared as a &quot;My Turn&quot; column published in the Pocono Record on Aug. 15.</strong></em></a></p>

<p>When I was a child growing up in Hazleton, I generously described where I was from as the &ldquo;western Poconos.&rdquo; After I learned how to ski at Camelback, became a rafting guide on the Lehigh, and later an angler who understood the holy nature of the Delaware River and its tributaries to fishing, I better understood my desire to be associated with the Poconos, its natural beauty and pristine waters.</p>

<p>The wild beauty and abundance of clean and exceptional waters of the Poconos has attracted generations of families, businesses, institutions, and tourists to invest in something here - be it the whole of their lives, a second home, their vacation time and recreation funds, or the dollars needed for major industry or small and family businesses to succeed. In fact, tourism has underpinned the wellbeing of the region, and travel tourism brings $3.5 billion to the area annually, according to Pocono Mountains Tourism Bureau, Pocono Mountain Tourism Fast Facts 2018. Together, people and businesses created a Pocono region that has been able to thrive and coexist with the environment &ndash; but now, that coexistence is threatened.</p>

<p>A new vision for Pocono tourism is now being touted, one that PennFuture and several of our local partners, neighbors and advocates do not support. This vision translates into major development schemes that will change the region. Instead of integrating with the land and water of this special place as businesses have done historically, the preference is to develop through wholesale clearing of forests and daylighting of shaded streams. In the place of previously natural areas, there are now swaths of macadam, concrete and swales that &ldquo;manage&rdquo; rainwater and snowmelt because artificial surfaces just can&rsquo;t absorb water as effectively as a forest.</p>

<p>Some holders of these big ideas and investors in this kind of development are finding it problematic to develop the Poconos in line with the rules that have made this place special for decades. We can&rsquo;t conjecture on why that is, but let&rsquo;s assume that some will argue that it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;too expensive&rdquo; to plan and engineer a development that discharges its used water into a stream in the same condition it was in when it was withdrawn from its source. We believe the majority of Pocono residents, businesses and visitors feel it is appropriate for everyone to share the responsibility for clean water, especially in a place like the Pocono region that is actually defined by its healthy environment. Also, according to the Pocono Mountain Tourism Fast Facts 2018, &ldquo;Tourism in the Pocono Mountains contributes to the triple bottom line (economic, social, and environmental) like no other industry in the region.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture and its partners are launching Our Pocono Waters Campaign to bring this issue to light and to protect the exceptional streams of our region. </strong>Through this campaign, we are working to bring awareness to the exceptional waters of the Poconos and the value the region ascribes to them. We hope to communicate to elected officials and business leaders that there are many more people who value the outstanding water quality in the Poconos than those who want to compromise our historic, pristine waters for their own benefit.</p>

<p><strong>We look forward to maintaining the legacy of natural beauty in the Poconos while supporting thoughtful, responsible development, and hope you will join us by visiting <a href=""http://www.ourpoconowaters.org"">www.ourpoconowaters.org</a> to learn more.</strong></p>

PennFuture’s Leadership Tour Explores the Poconos,7/30/2018,"<div><em><strong>By Nancy Wottrich, Member of PennFuture&rsquo;s President&rsquo;s Leadership Council.</strong></em></div>

<div></div>

<div>PennFuture&rsquo;s Spring 2018 Presidents Leadership Council Tour was held in the Poconos of Northeast PA over the course of two days in which we discovered this beautiful region, learning about its natural and human history and discussing some of the pressing environmental issues currently threatening the area. If I were to sum up my experience on this tour with just a few words, they would be &ldquo;progressing, connecting and reflecting.&rdquo;</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Progressing:</strong> While some in decision-making positions persist in holding back alternative energy growth in this country, visionary individuals and groups are forging ahead to a fossil-free future &ndash; and the movement continues to expand. Mark Culp, Physical Plant Director of Northampton Community College&rsquo;s Monroe Campus, provided our group with an in-depth tour of this Gold LEED facility. Everything about this campus has been designed for energy efficiency and sustainability. Impressively, all energy use is constantly monitored and adjusted by computer to maximize efficiency.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Connecting:</strong> To paraphrase author John McPhee, it&rsquo;s not enough to just fight to protect the places we cherish. We need to make time to enjoy them as well &ndash; to connect through learning about them, to experience their raw beauty and strength, and to immerse ourselves in nature&rsquo;s solitude, peace and healing qualities. From this comes our perseverance to keep up the fight.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Short of its former reputation as the &ldquo;Honeymoon Capital of the East,&rdquo; the Poconos area is also known for its clear, cold tannin streams that tumble off the plateau in a series of spectacular waterfalls. Home to native brook trout, these streams were coveted by elite fly-fishing clubs that bought up large tracts of land to protect their private playgrounds. Coupled with this are equally large tracts of state forest lands scattered around the plateau and down the escarpment to the Delaware River.</div>

<div>As a result of these protected lands, many of the Poconos streams have been classified as &ldquo;Exceptional Value&rdquo; because they have the best and cleanest conditions. This status also affords them the highest level of protection when it comes to runoff, discharge and land disruption.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Along the banks of Cranberry Creek in VanBuskirk Preserve, native ferns and wildflowers abound under the shade of hemlocks and rhododendron. Rocks in the streams are carpeted with thick layers of moss and tree bark covered in lichens attest to the clean air quality. Water splashing over rocks and a symphony of bird songs are the music here. There is a peacefulness that washes over one standing in a place like this &ndash; a connection that is found no where else than in the midst of nature. This preserve has protected one small fragment of precious habitat that once was found throughout the region. Exploring the creek further and with the aid of aquatic biologist Eric Baird, we sampled for macro-invertebrates. The kinds of species and quantity of each found can tell one a lot about the overall health of the stream. The greatest diversity is found in cold, clear waters, like those in the Poconos, and provide food for the trout that reside here. </div>

<div></div>

<div>It naturally followed that after learning about the Pocono streams, we should have the opportunity to enjoy them. Some in the group were treated to private guided fly-fishing excursions on several of the famous trout streams in this area. While I am not a fly fisher person, I can certainly relate to the zen-like nature of the sport. Standing quietly along a babbling stream, tuned in to the insect hatch and skillfully laying down a hand-made duplicate ever so gently onto the surface of the water. And of course the exhilaration of the catch, should one be so lucky!</div>

<div></div>

<div>Others in the group experienced the soggy and solitary nature of Tannersville Cranberry Bog, a property of The Nature Conservancy. Nestled within 1,000 acres of protected land, this is the southern most boreal bog east of the Mississippi River. Here sphagnum moss slowly decays into peat, forming a layer over 40 feet thick and carnivorous plants thrive in the nutrient poor soil. As night descended, the bog chorus of birds and amphibians amplified. Even though the main road was less than a quarter mile away, it felt like we could have been deep in the wilderness. I am eternally grateful to the individuals who had the foresight to protect this unique habitat.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Covering more than 130 square miles throughout the Pocono region, the protected lands of Delaware State Forest have become a haven for native plants and wildlife and a refuge for the Golden-winged Warbler, a species declining so rapidly that it has been a candidate for the federal Endangered Species List. Loss of its very specific habitat along with Blue-winged Warbler hybridization have brought the bird to extremely low levels in Pennsylvania. Bruce McNaught, a member of PennFuture&rsquo;s Leadership Council and a consulting biologist for the Pa. Game Commission, has been surveying this bird in the Poconos for over 10 years. With his leadership, we toured areas of the state forest currently being managed for Golden-winged Warbler restoration. Thanks to the research of people like Bruce, recommendations from the International Golden-winged Warbler Group and coordinated efforts through the PA Bureau of Forestry, critical habitat management is occurring, and small stable populations of this species persist in Pike County.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Reflecting: </strong>Will we humans ever learn to live in harmony with our earth? It has been said we learn from our mistakes, but too often that is not the case when it comes to economic growth and setting environmental policy. Be it ego, greed or misguided beliefs, we continue to make the same mistakes, and the health of our planet takes a hit each time. A very informative tour of Gray Towers, home of Gifford Pinchot brought home this point. As the first director of the US Forest Service, two-time PA governor, life-long conservationist and outdoor enthusiast, both Pinchot&rsquo;s professional and life philosophy was centered around wise use of our resources to benefit humankind, while still preserving the integrity of those resources. A book his father gave him on his 21st birthday instilled this ethic in him. The book, &ldquo;Man and Nature: The Earth as Modified by Human Action&rdquo; was published in 1864 and addressed the concern that human actions were causing dire consequences to the health of the earth. A highlighted quote caught my eye. It was written 154 years ago, but sadly the message is still as applicable today: &ldquo;Man depends upon soil, water, plants and animals. But in securing his <span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>livelihood, he may unwittingly destroy the fabric of nature that supports him.Therefore, men must learn to understand their environment and how they <span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>affect it. And they must take action, individual and collective to restore and <span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>maintain a more viable setting. &ldquo;</div>

<div></div>

<div>Interlaced with our enrichment experiences was serious discussion about the current environmental issues facing this region, including climate change, land development, and water quality, some of the issues PennFuture is tackling. </div>

<div></div>

<div>Streams in the Poconos, and streams in general, were used as dump sites for eons. Flowing into the Delaware River, the water source for over 15 million people, the quality of these streams is critical. Regulations established to clean them up have been very successful, and both the flora and fauna have rebounded. Now, however, many of those regulations are being challenged and attacked, and the result could be a return to the unhealthy and polluted conditions these streams previously endured.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The economic revival of the Pocono region has seen an increase in land development, with expansion of housing, businesses and resort complexes.While this may be good for the economy, it must not be at the cost of habitat loss and ecological degradation. Tourism and outdoor recreation are the basis of this region&rsquo;s economy. There are proven ways to have the growth that feeds the tourism industry without destroying that which attracts them in the first place. Businesses, industry and environmental groups must work together to reach agreements on how to provide for growth while preserving the resources, wild places and natural beauty. PennFuture&rsquo;s challenge and initiative is to make this the pivotal point upon which decisions for this region are based.</div>

How Climate Change is Affecting Baseball Games Across the Country,7/30/2018,"<p>Recently, the Harrisburg Senators had to cancel its game against the Bowie Baysox in anticipation of the Susquehanna River flooding out City Island. Like many others, I was disappointed because I was looking forward to an evening of cheering on the home team. I was also disappointed because the Senators had planned to host their first ever &ldquo;Go Green&rdquo; night to benefit and promote a number of local environmental organizations, including PennFuture. The Senators are to be applauded for organizing this promotion and I greatly look forward to participating in it next season&mdash;as long as City Island isn&rsquo;t flooded again.</p>

<p>Rainouts have always been a part of baseball, but are we seeing something different? Thanks to climate change, abnormal weather conditions are becoming the new normal. This year&rsquo;s baseball season opened with a record 28 major league games being postponed in April because of weather conditions. Having a ballpark on an island certainly makes the minor league Senators more vulnerable to inclement weather, but what we are experiencing this summer is extreme.</p>

<p>Dr. Michael Mann, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State and PennFuture Board Member says, &ldquo;The extreme weather we are seeing this summer around the Northern Hemisphere (i.e. extreme heatwaves, floods, droughts, and wildfires), including the extreme rainfall seen recently here in Pennsylvania, is related to an unusually stationary, highly meandering perturbation in the jet stream. Our work (i.e. this article last year: <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45242"">https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45242</a>) shows that this sort of pattern, which has been associated with many of the most extreme, persistent weather events in recent years including the 2003 European heat wave, 2010 Moscow wildfires, 2011 Texas &amp; Oklahoma drought, 2016 Alberta wildfires etc., is becoming more common because of human-caused climate change (and in particular, because of amplified Arctic warming).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rainouts and flooding are not the only threats to America&rsquo;s oldest pastime. <a href=""http://blog.nwf.org/2018/07/how-will-climate-change-affect-the-future-of-baseball/"">According to a recent report from the National Wildlife Federation</a> the high humidity that much of the country is experiencing is making the balls heavier with moisture, and it is easier to hit a home-run with a heavier ball&mdash;and not just in the Colorado Rockies ballpark where they&rsquo;ve been storing their baseballs in humidors since 2002. For 2018, the MLB has mandated that all teams store their balls in an &ldquo;air conditioned and enclosed room&rdquo; with a sensor to help determine if every team should be required to use humidors.</p>

<p>Another issue affecting baseball, according to NWF, relates not to the balls, but the bats. The invasive Emerald ash borer beetle has killed millions of ash trees since 2002. And ash happens to be one of the most popular woods for making baseball bats. Unfortunately, like games in April and infield hits, the ash bat may become a thing of the past for baseball fans because of climate change.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/03/29/poll-most-pennsylvania-voters-say-climate-change-causing-problems-now/"">According to a Franklin &amp; Marshall College/StateImpact Pennsylvania poll this spring</a>, the majority of us in PA believe that climate change is causing problems right now and that the state should be doing more to address it.</p>

<p>Confronting a problem of this magnitude can seem overwhelming. Individually, we all have a voice &ndash; collectively, we have impact. PennFuture amplifies this voice. Recently, we worked with a coalition of 25 unified environmental groups across the state to create the first-ever Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda. The Common Agenda is a comprehensive blueprint the next governor can use to address our environmental challenges. It provides the candidates with common sense solutions for the state to move towards a clean energy economy and increase environmental protection for our most vulnerable communities, and just maybe our baseball parks too. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Updated-Final-Version-of-the-PA-Common-Conservation-Agenda-5.1.18.pdf"">You can read the Common Agenda herewhile waiting for the rain delay to end.</a></p>

What You Can Do For Your Watershed,7/30/2018,"<p>On Wednesday, July 18, I met with a dedicated group of citizen scientistswho gathered to learn more about how to get involved with policy in their watershed. Hosted at the Visitor Center of the Pennypack Ecological Restoration Trust in the Pennypack Preserve, 15 volunteers from watershed organizations throughout the greater Philadelphia area participated, including representatives from the Wissahickon Valley Watershed Association, the Tookany-Tacony/Frankford Watershed Partnership, Pennypack Ecological Restoration Trust, and Friends of Poquessing Watershed.</p>

<p>Citizen scientists play an important role in protecting our waterways. Watershed organizations have recruited and trained volunteers to sample water quality and look for signs of pollution that traditional surveys may have missed. Citizen scientists are trained to identify the most visible signs of pollution, such as debris, water discoloration, odors, surface films and sheens, fish kills, and algal blooms. Volunteers also sample water and test for nutrients, such as phosphorus and chlorine. A volunteer scientist can sometimes be the first line of defense against pollution in our waterways&mdash;seeing the warning signs firsthand and alerting coordinators, emergency responders, and the PA Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP).</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of the gathering was to explore ways that citizen scientists can transform their data and water testing experiences into policy action and change.</strong>We partnered with Gayle Killam, Deputy Director of Science and Policy at River Network, Lindsay Blanton, Water Programs Coordinator for Wissahickon Valley Watershed Association, and Kevin Roth, Stewardship Assistant for Pennypack Ecological Restoration Trust, to discuss how data and personal stories can make a difference for our waterways through participating at regulatory hearings, commenting on permits, and advocating for stronger legislative protections.</p>

<p><strong>There are many avenues you can take to protect our waterways, too. For instance, when you find pollution in your creek, you can take immediate action by calling the PA DEP &ldquo;Emergencies and Spills Hotline&rdquo; (1-800-541-2050). </strong>When pollution causes a fish kill, for example, your advocacy and knowledge can help raise awareness about it and resolve the problem through stronger regulations and more effective policies.</p>

Saving Energy on a Budget,7/30/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Veronica Manning, PennFuture Intern</strong></em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to save energy on a budget with a few practical, simple steps. Here are some easy, cost-effective ways to decrease your home&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p>

<p><strong>Switch to Clean Energy for Your Electricity</strong></p>

<p>Switching to a clean energy provider for your electricity is a simple alternative that allows you to rely less on fossil fuels. Pennsylvania is one of 17 states with a retail electric program, which lets customers choose where they buy their electricity.Using renewable energy doesn&rsquo;t require changing your utility company. In Pennsylvania,electricity utility companies own the distribution networks in a local area, or the wires that connect your house to the rest of the grid. The utility companies buy energy from a mix of sources, and that energy is then sent to their customers. Customers who have not chosen an electricity generator receive default electricity service, or energy that comes from multiple generators.Choosing your generation provider means that your same utility company will now send energy from your specified source instead of providing default electricity service to your home. Depending on what source you choose, this clean energy also may also be cheaper than what you currently pay for default electricity.</p>

<p>Switching to a clean energy provider can be done online in a few minutes. <a href=""/Files/Admin/TakethePowerBack_Steps-to-Take-for-Parents.pdf""><strong>Follow our step-by-step guide here to get started.</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Reduce Your Standby Power Consumption</strong></p>

<p>Standby power is a term for the energy used by devices that appear to be off. Electronics like TVs, phone and laptop chargers, streaming devices, and gaming consuls all consume a small amount of power while in sleep mode. The Department of Energy estimates that standby power accounts for up to 10 percentof the total residential energy use in the U.S. </p>

<p>While standby power is necessary for the functioning of many appliances in your home, you can still reduce your standby power consumption by turning off nonessential devices when not in use.Your electronics can either be unplugged individually or grouped on a shared power strip. Some smart power strips also have an option to set a timer, automatically turning off your devices for you.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to spend more, you can also consider replacing your appliances with more efficient models. Older appliances consume more standby power than their newer counterparts. When shopping, look for models with an <a href=""https://www.energystar.gov/"">ENERGY STAR</a> certification. These products meet EPA guidelines for appliances that are both energy efficient and cost-effective in the long term. You also have the option of switching to a programmable thermostat. The EPA found that replacing a manual thermostat can cut heating or cooling costs by 20 percent or more.</p>

<p>For more information on standby power, <a href=""https://standby.lbl.gov/faq/#what"">check out this fact sheet from the Berkley Lab.</a></p>

<p><strong>Use LED Lightbulbs</strong></p>

<p>If you are still using incandescent lightbulbs, consider switching to LEDs. Incandescent lightbulbs lose about 90 percent of the energy they consume as heat. Because so much energy is wasted, an incandescent bulb requires more energy to produce the same amount of light as an LED.</p>

<p>Light-emitting diodes, or LED bulbs, lose about 10 percent of the energy they consume as heat, making them much more efficient than their incandescent counterparts. They are more expensive than traditional lightbulbs, but last about 10 years. LEDs are also easy to dispose of once they have reached the end of their lifespan.</p>

<p>While compact fluorescent light bulbs, or CFLs, are sometimes also listed as another energy-efficient alternative to incandescent bulbs, they are much less efficient than LEDs. CFLS lose about 80 percent of the energy they consume as heat. CFLs also contain mercury and need to be specially recycled to prevent contamination. If you have CFL bulbs in your home, you should replace them with LEDs once they burn out or break. Your local waste collection service and some stores may offer cheap or free CFL recycling. Check online to see what&rsquo;s available in your area. The EPA has also released guidelines for cleanup and disposal of broken CFL bulbs, <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/cfl"">which can be found here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Line Dry Your Laundry</strong></p>

<p>Electric tumble dryers are one of the biggest consumers of energy in many households. In 2014, the <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/efficient-clothes-dryers-IB.pdf"">National Resource Defense Council</a> found that the typical electric dryer had seen only marginal improvements in energy efficiency since 1981. As of 2015, ENERGY STAR certified dryers are available, but these machines still consume large amounts of energy compared to other energy-efficient appliances.</p>

<p>Line drying your laundry is a great way to reduce the energy consumed by drying clothes in an electric tumble drier. Sheets, blouses, dress shirts, and other items made of medium to lightweight fabric can be dried outdoors on a line. If line drying is not an option in your area, consider investing in an indoor drying rack for items like sweaters.</p>

<p><strong>Use Window Coverings to Keep Your Home at a Comfortable Temperature</strong><br />
<br />
Using window coverings will reduce energy loss and save money on your heating and cooling bills. Heating energy can escape through your windows and decrease your home&rsquo;s energy efficiency. Uncovered windows also allow heat from sunlight to enter your home, making it harder to stay cool in the warmer months.</p>

<p>If you already have coverings on your windows, use them strategically to improve your energy efficiency. Window coverings should be opened on sunny winter mornings to allow heat from sunlight to enter your home throughout the day. Coverings should be closed on summer days to reduce heat from direct sunlight. Windows that do not receive direct sunlight can be left uncovered to take advantage of natural light.</p>

<p>If you do not already have coverings on all of your windows, <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/energy-efficient-window-attachments"">use this guide from the Department of Energy</a> to find which type would work best for you.</p>

Engaging on Environmental Concerns and Listening across the State: Meet the CEO Happy Hours,7/27/2018,"<p>This spring, PennFuture kicked off a series of Meet the CEO Happy Hour events around the state, as we wanted to create opportunities for me to meet more of our supporters, activists and partners spread all around this very large Commonwealth. </p>

<p>More importantly, we wanted to create a chance for all of you, as our eyes and ears on the ground, to talk with me, share your concerns and meet other members of our talented PennFuture staff. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this time a lot, and now I feel much more plugged into a community of people who care deeply about our environment, and who are doing remarkable work to protect it.</p>

<p>After the 2016 elections, PennFuture made a conscious decision to be more active in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s mid-sized towns and communities. Our happy hours are a part of that endeavor, and now have taken us to Erie, Ambler, State College, Mount Pocono, and of course Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where I tend to spend a lot of time already. I&rsquo;ve learned quite a bit more about the concerns of folks living in these places and I wanted to share some of what I have heard with all of you.</p>

<p><strong>One of our best attended events was held in Erie, where I reconnected with several activists who shared their concerns about Erie Coke Works.</strong>While we are not ready to make specific pronouncements about pollution from the facility, the community may be dealing with significant pollution problems, based on the odors and visible emissions coming from the works. There were conversations about the Lake Erie and French Creek and about renewable energy opportunities, and threats from pipelines and plastics. We had a chance to meet a large group of senior academics and administrators from Gannon University, who were not there for the happy hour, but with whom a lot of synergy is now evident.</p>

<p><strong>In Pittsburgh, there was a lot of talk about air quality, fracking and the petrochemical build-out underway and led by Shell Global in nearby Beaver County.</strong>I connected with some old friends from the nine years I spent living and working in Pittsburgh. For as much time spent talking over the challenges, there was good talk about renewable energy over microbrews. PennFuture has had a presence in Pittsburgh since its beginning, and so many of you who came out have had long relationships with our organization.</p>

<p><strong>Up in the Poconos, we had a fantastic turnout and we saw friends from close partners like Brodhead Watershed Association and Trout Unlimited.</strong>PennFuture&rsquo;s office in Mount Pocono is focused on protecting those high quality headwater streams of the Delaware River Basin, and so there was a lot of talk about Exceptional Value streams, and how they must continue to be protected, while at the same time allowing for economic development to flourish. We had a group from the Wind Gap area come to talk to us about sludge disposal and their work to protect their community.</p>

<p><strong>In Ambler, I had a chance to meet Mayor Jeanne Sorg, and talk about Ambler&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability, including clean energy.</strong>My conversation with Mayor Sorg gave me some food for thought as PennFuture looks to expand its Clean Energy Communities project beyond Pittsburgh. Mayor Sorg reminded me that as clean water and clean energy are intrinsic to healthy, thriving communities, the bottom line for elected officials is managing a budget and how important it will be that green solutions and practices are positively impacting those bottom lines. Wissahickon Valley Watershed Association staff showed up in numbers for some socializing, and several important local activists came out to support the event.</p>

<p><strong>Renowned Penn State climate scientist and PennFuture board member Michael Mann joined us in State College, and there was a lot of talk about climate and politics and how we can tackle the lack of leadership among most elected officials on our issues.</strong>I had a chance to reconnect with a woman who shares my name, almost 30 years after we found out the other existed on a bus trip to Washington, D.C. for a rally after the Three Mile Island disaster. She&rsquo;s not of blood relation, but she and others who came out for the happy hour share the same DNA for environmental advocacy.</p>

<p><strong>We also had a crowd at the new Yards Brewery in Philadelphia, a business we love because of their commitment to renewable energy.</strong><strong>By far, the biggest question we heard over and over was, &ldquo;What can I do to help?&rdquo;</strong> There&rsquo;s so much you can do.As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in past blogs, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/greenin18"" target=""_blank"">our Green in &rsquo;18 campaign is seeking volunteers through the fall.</a>Our <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/join-the-ace-program"" target=""_blank"">Advocates for Conservation and the Environment (ACE) program</a> is training volunteers to do education on issues and meetings with legislators in district offices. That program is slowly expanding and we&rsquo;d welcome your help. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/newsletter-sign-up"" target=""_blank"">We also ask that you subscribe to our email list</a>, as your engagement and rapid response to action alerts will allow you to contact your legislators and push them on specific actions when in session, and we will always keep you up to date on the latest environmental legislation moving in Harrisburg.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who attended, just to say hello, or to bring important issues to our attention.While PennFuture does not have the capacity to work on every environmental issue in the state, we haveconcerns after several of these conversations and will be looking into next steps.</p>

<p>We need you to be our eyes and ears on the ground because our state is large and we cannot be everywhere &ndash; as much as we would like to be.In the meantime, we count on you.I want to thank all of the PennFuture board members and President&rsquo;s Leadership Council members, and ACE volunteers who have joined us thus far. Thanks to the staff who came out, and broughttheir family members, and significant others with them. I hope to see more of you at future happy hours that are on our calendar for the rest of the summer into spring.</p>

Why You Should Join Tom Wolf & Scott Wagner on the Campaign Trail,7/27/2018,"<div>The threats to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment have never been more urgent. We have the third worst air quality in the country, and as a result, in some Pennsylvania cities, one in three children suffers from asthma. Pennsylvania drinking water ranks as one the nations riskiest for lead-contamination, and 19,000 miles of our streams and rivers are unsafe for drinking, recreation, aquatic life, or agricultural use. The race to exploit the abundance of natural gas beneath the surface has turned Pennsylvania into one of the largest producers of methane, a major health and climate hazard, and has produced large quantities of wastewater and solid waste, which has exposed Pennsylvanians to harmful substances that cause a variety of serious illnesses.</div>

<div></div>

<div>In response, a coalition of 26 environmental organizations across the state, led by PennFuture, developed the <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/CCA_2nd-Edition_Web-Version-6.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda</strong></a>, a comprehensive series of fiscally responsible solutions to the problems above. Another advantage of the agenda: the recommended solutions can be enacted by the incoming governor using the executive authority granted in the state constitution. With a pivotal gubernatorial election taking place on November 6, this would seem like an opportune time to distribute the agenda. But so far, weve heard little about either candidate&rsquo;s environmental and conservation agendas.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Why are the candidates focusing so little attention on the environment? After all, aren&rsquo;t more and more people convinced that the environmental problems facing Pennsylvania must be addressed before it&rsquo;s too late? The answer to the latter question is a resounding &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; The <a href=""https://www.fandm.edu/uploads/files/708725106986767486-f-m-poll-release-march-2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"">March 2018 Franklin and Marshall College Poll</a> survey of 423 Pennsylvania registered voters found that 62% think climate change is causing problems now, and 67% think the state should do more to address the problems associated with climate change, including 47% who say the state should definitely do more. What&rsquo;s more, 55% of the respondents believe the potential environmental risks of natural gas drilling outweigh the potential economic benefits, a turnaround of the findings in a Franklin &amp; Marshall survey four years earlier.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Yet despite these findings, only 2% of the participants in the March 2018 poll believe that the environment is the most important problem facing the state, a sentiment that is essentially the same as in other recent Franklin &amp; Marshal polls. The top five concerns expressed by Pennsylvania voters in March were:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Government &amp; politicians<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>16%</li>
	<li>Taxes<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>15%</li>
	<li>Unemployment &amp; personal finances<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>12%</li>
	<li>Crime, drugs, violence, and guns<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>10%</li>
	<li>Education/schools<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>9%</li>
</ul>

<div>These five problems have been at the top of the list dating back to early 2017, while the environment has ranked no higher than seventh during this time period and has not been mentioned by more than 3% of Franklin &amp; Marshall poll participants. So, although Pennsylvania voters are concerned about the environment and want to see more action taken, they consider other issues even more important. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that the issues overshadowing the environment are the ones being discussed on the campaign trail. I can personally attest to that having attended a Scott Wagner town hall last week.</div>

<div></div>

<div>To overcome this, the PA Common Conservation Agenda coalition <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/greenin18"" target=""_blank"">created the Green in &rsquo;18 campaign.</a> To advance the agenda, it is vital that both gubernatorial candidates start discussing environmental issues on the campaign trail and presenting their plans for restoring the health of the state&rsquo;s environment and safeguarding it for future generations. The only way this will happen is if the Green in &rsquo;18 campaign can elevate the importance of the environment in voters&rsquo; minds, and motivate them to get out on the campaign trail and ask the candidates questions about their positions on and plans for the environment.</div>

PennFuture Joins Forces with Franklin County Coalition for Progress for Presentation,7/27/2018,"<p>On Saturday, July 14, PennFuture provided a presentation on &quot;Climate, Stewardship, and Environmental Justice&quot; at the Coyle Free Library in Chambersburg, Pa. as dozens of activists came out to discuss and learn more about a variety of environmental issues hindering our Commonwealth.</p>

<p>PennFuture was invited to present and participate in the event by Franklin County Coalition for Progress (FCCP), a local advocacy group advancing social justice and equality for all residents in Franklin County. Topics ranged from federal and state policy, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s standing in the Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP), and environmental justice.</p>

<p>I had the honor of joining my colleagues, Ezra Thrush, Director of Policy, and Roman Acri, Green in 18&rsquo; south-central Pennsylvania campaign organizer, on a variety of conversations with the attendees.</p>

<p>Ezra began the event by highlighting several essential pieces of work he has been a part of. It has been a busy legislative season for our Director of Policy, and the impact of it has been felt across the board by those in the conservation effort and beyond. Highlighting the positive and negative aspects of the House and Senate Farm Bills, as well as increased funding for our environmental agencies, he informed the coalition that much has been accomplished &ndash; yet much more work still needs to be done.</p>

<p>My work primarily revolves around the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers, specifically the cleanup and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. On April 10, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental advocates and state agencies conducted a meeting where they developed their toolbox for four pilot counties that will be heading up the initial strategy of reducing pollution and runoff, and developing best management practices (BMP&rsquo;s) to help Pennsylvania reach its Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) goals.</p>

<p>With Pennsylvania being so far behind in its pollution reduction goals, I highlighted some of the most important areas of work that are taking place at the state and county levels. Being in Franklin County, which is one of the four pilot counties of the WIP pilot program, Chambersburg plays a critical role in the progress of our pollution reduction goals. With their state-of-the art MS4 program, this small town is making big progress and setting a great example for the south central part of the state.</p>

<p>Roman then closed out the session talking about Environmental Justice in the state. According to the PA Department of Environmental Protection, nearly one-third of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s population lives in an Environmental Justice area. These areas are now defined as a census block group with a 30 percent or greater minority population, or a 20 percent or greater population at or below the poverty level. &ldquo;These are really important issues that are severely harming entire communities &ndash; solely because of where they live,&rdquo; Roman said. &ldquo;We have a responsibility not only as advocates, but as human beings, to look out for each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PennFuture would like to thank the Franklin County Coalition for Progress for allowing us to speak at their meeting. Any time environmental advocates are able to come together, enjoy some coffee, and discuss environmental protections is a good day.</p>

<p>FCCP is leading the way to a renewal of the promise of America; that Franklin County becomes a community of welcome, acceptance, fairness, and opportunity for all people. They hold monthly seminars on the second Saturday of every month from 10am-12pm at the Coyle Free Library in Chambersburg. The next few months will continue the focus of watershed health, specifically examining the Borough of Chambersburg storm water sewer systems.

Cloudy with a 100% Chance of Solar Power Generation,7/17/2018,"<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/PennFuture%2D1%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 700px; height: 726px;"" /></p>

<p>Bob and Susan Donnan have always had an appreciation for the environment, and after choosing to go solar at their home in Peters Township, common misconceptions about installing solar panels in Western Pennsylvania were quickly shattered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was surprised by how much energy could be stored on cloudy or partly cloudy days,&rdquo; Susan said. &ldquo;People think it has to be sunny all of the time and that is a misconception.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The couple attended PennFuture&rsquo;s Annual Pittsburgh Solar Tour in October 2017. Just a couple of weeks later during a trip to Home Depot, Bob spoke to representatives from Solar City, made an appointment for a free estimate, and made the switch to solar energy.</strong></p>

<p>The couple&rsquo;s passion for clean energy stems from their shared desire to create a better world for future generations, especially their own family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My greatest concern is the environment I am leaving for my grandchildren. I worry about the future and I feel many people are concerned with profit and making money. I am concerned for my grandkids,&rdquo; Susan said.</p>

<p>Susan, a volunteer with Face2Face Healing, and Bob, a retired landscaper, live in a home that now has 11 solar panels that are then backed up by a Tesla power wall. The panels are a 3.3 kilowatt system. The Tesla power wall is a rated 14 kilowatt hour lithium ion battery, of which 13.5 kilowatts are useable. The panels supply the house with energy, and any excess power produced by the solar panels is then stored in the power wall. This is helpful because it gives the home energy independence in the event that the grid goes down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been days when we put energy back on the grid, which is a good feeling,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;Today, we were 97% self-powered. Yesterday, we were 100% self-powered and for the week, we have been 86% self-powered. This month, our home has been 72% self-powered.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The combination of attending PennFuture&rsquo;s Pittsburgh Solar Tour and then bumping into Solar City workers around the same time period spurred their choice to go solar.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;While on the tour, I learned more about the orientation of the panels and got a better idea of what the production would do for those families and households,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;We learned about the SRECS and renewable credits. It just gave you a feel for seeing it up close and talking to someone about it, and hearing about their commitment, interest and their knowledge. Everyone was enthusiastic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They also liked the fact that many of the homes were right in their neighborhood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It came out to our local area and that made it more interesting to us,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;These were areas I was familiar with and one place I drive past often. There was a nice group of people on the bus and snacks &ndash; you always remember the food.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Bob and Susan encourage those interested to attend PennFuture&rsquo;s Pittsburgh Solar Tour Oct. 6, 2018 to get an idea of the clean energy possibilities for their own families and homes.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;They can get a firsthand look for themselves, talk through how it works for them and be pretty specific, getting a close-up look at panels on a roof, learning about a power wall, how it works and what it does,&rdquo; Bob said.</p>

<p>Throughout the process, the couple has discovered the power of going solar and the possibilities it can bring, even if it&rsquo;s a typically dreary Pittsburgh day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think if I have learned something, it&rsquo;s that I am kind of surprised to see that the panels still produce even after the sun goes over the house in the late afternoon and into the evening. We still get production. The panels produce energy for a lot longer period every day than I thought they would &ndash; it is surprising even on a grey, cloudy day, you still get production,&rdquo; he said.</p>

RESPECTAgZone Aims to Protect Community from Intrusive Proposed Power Lines Route,6/27/2018,"<div><em><strong>By Susan Cenname, RESPECTAgZone Member and Indiana Township Resident</strong></em></div>

<div></div>

<div>For the past year, residents of Indiana Township, adjacent to Hartwood Acres County Park, have been under a threat that would change their way of life, the appearance of their community, the value of their homes, and the safety of their land. The threat has been unnecessary on many levels, and yet it persists.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Residents first learned of the threat from a benign-appearing notice that began, &ldquo;Dear Duquesne Light Customer: As new homes are being built and the demand for energy grows in the area, Duquesne Light Company [DLC] is working to maintain a level of reliability customers have come to expect while increasing the overall resiliency of the grid. Our dedication to improving the way energy is delivered is just one of the many ways we are working to become your next generation energy company.&rdquo;</div>

<div></div>

<div>It went on to describe the company&rsquo;s plans to build a new high-voltage transmission line through Indiana Township to service West Deer Municipality. The notices did not contain any maps of the routes being considered by the company. The description of the project failed to vividly reflect the dramatic impact 150-foot high towers would have on our environment, working farms, and landscape.</div>

<div></div>

<div>This notice initiated a process by which residents educated themselves about DLC, their project, its alternatives, and the approvals needed before it could happen. The notice also spurred community members to organize around the issue into a cohesive voice that would be heard by DLC and other decision-makers.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>The Project:</strong> DLC is proposing to construct a 128 kV high-power transmission line through Indiana Township to serve West Deer Municipality. The question is: how will DLC achieve that goal? DLC initially proposed three routes through Indiana Township. DLC&rsquo;s proposal identified a &ldquo;preferred route,&rdquo; which passed next to Allegheny County&rsquo;s Hartwood Acres Park. All three routes initially proposed would cut through prime agricultural lands.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>The Common Sense Alternative: </strong>Through the work of a Township employee, local citizens identified a fourth alternative that would achieve DLC&rsquo;s goals without the social and environmental impacts of the initial alternatives. This route would hug the Turnpike for much of its path - thereby avoiding much of Indiana Township&rsquo;s prime agricultural lands and Hartwood Acres Park.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>That Turnpike Route, as we term it, has many win-win characteristics.</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>It limits visual and environmental degradation to areas already impacted by the Turnpike itself;</li>
	<li>It can share some of the existing right-of-way belonging to the Turnpike, which reduces costs and impacts associated with right-of-way management;</li>
	<li>It provides greater engineering redundancy and resiliency to the electric grid&mdash;a stated project goal for DLC;</li>
	<li>It is supported by the PA Turnpike Commission; the PA Department of Agriculture, the PA Office Small Business Administration, and the local community; and</li>
	<li>It causes the least environmental and social impact of any of the alternatives being considered.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>The Process: </strong>As our group dug into this proposed project, we learned that DLC had to follow a specific process in order to obtain approval to implement it. Because DLC is a regulated electric service provider that has the authority to condemn private property, it must apply for approval and obtain the consent of the Public Utility Commission (PUC) before implementing the project. The cost of this project will be borne by DLC&rsquo;s customers, so DLC must first and foremost demonstrate a need for the project. After performing an environmental assessment of the alternatives, DLC must justify its choice of routes before the PUC.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Because the PUC is a government entity, its decision, and by extension DLC&rsquo;s decision, must comply with Article I, Section 27 of the PA Constitution, known as the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA). The ERA requires government, when faced with equally practicable alternatives, to choose that which does not harm the fundamental constitutional rights granted citizens by Section 27, that is, the right to clean air, pure water, and the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.</div>

<div></div>

<div>If this project is needed, we, the citizens of Indiana Township who have organized as RespectAgZone, urge DLC to choose the most common sense alternative for its proposed high-voltage power line -- along the existing Pennsylvania Turnpike route. Only that route minimizes environmental and social costs while achieving the overall benefits proposed for the project. RespectAgZone is pleased to have the assistance of and be represented in this matter by PennFuture, which we were glad to learn recently won an important land use decision before the PA Supreme Court, and which has substantial experience before the PUC.</div>

<div></div>

<div>We look forward to the day when DLC removes the constant threat of this proposed project and does the right thing by prioritizing the long-term natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic values of these beautiful lands so accessible to the citizens of the city of Pittsburgh.</div>

State Budget Headed in the Right Direction for Environment,6/26/2018,"<div>Governor Tom Wolf signed into law a $32.7 billion spending plan for the Fiscal Year 2018-19 Pennsylvania state budget (House Bill 2121). Compared to the long budget stalemates Pennsylvania has dealt with over the last few years, this appropriations bill made its way through the General Assembly on time and with modest increases in investment for environmental protection.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s FY2018-19 Budget &amp; the Environment</strong></div>

<div>It&rsquo;s important to put Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental investment budget in context first: our key state resource agencies and commissions are chronically underfunded, understaffed, and work with aging infrastructure. For almost two decades, Pennsylvania Governors and legislators &ndash; both Democrats and Republicans &ndash; cut environmental budgets even while ecological stressors like natural gas drilling and climate change were on the rise.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The FY2018-19 state budget does very little to reverse these decades of dismantling and it will take strong bipartisan leadership in Harrisburg to reverse this costly trend. Nonetheless, the state budget provides modest increases that allow the Commonwealth&rsquo;s resource agencies, such as the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to slightly increase capacity and not have to cut back programming.</div>

<div></div>

<div>In fact, unlike the last few years, no environmental agency or commission we work hard to advocate for saw spending cuts and some saw increases. It signals some hope that this budget indicates a floor to the cuts and a beginning to the long-road to building strong, well-financed and staffed environmental and conservation agencies that protect and advance public health and a sustainable economy.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Take a closer look at the FY2018-19 budget allocations (HB 2121):</strong></div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Department of Agriculture</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>$1M increase from FY2017-18 for General Operations</li>
	<li>$3M increase from FY2017-18 for Spotted Lanternfly Control</li>
	<li>Overall, $7.49M increase for PDA from FY2017-18</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>$1.74M increase from FY2017-18 for General Operations (from Oil &amp; Gas Lease Fund)</li>
	<li>$5.16M increase from FY2017-18 for State Parks Operations (from Oil &amp; Gas Lease Fund)</li>
	<li>$6.52M increase from FY2017-18 for State Forests Operations (from Oil &amp; Gas Lease Fund)</li>
	<li>$2.50M increase from FY2017-18 for Parks &amp; Forests Infrastructure</li>
	<li>Overall, $16.1M increase for DCNR from FY2017-18</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Department of Environmental Protection</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>$1.07M increase from FY2017-18 for General Operations</li>
	<li>$1.52M increase from FY2017-18 for Environmental Program Management</li>
	<li>$3.98M increase from FY2017-18 for Environmental Protection Operations</li>
	<li>$135K increase from FY2017-18 for Chesapeake Bay Agricultural Source Abatement</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18 for DRBC (Delaware River Basin) - $217K</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18 for SRBC (Susquehanna River Basin) - $237K</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18 for ICPRB (Potomac River Basin) - $23K</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18 for ORSANCO (Ohio River Basin) - $68K</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18 for Chesapeake Bay Commission - $275K</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18 for Conservation District Fund - $2.5M</li>
	<li>Overall, $6.84M increase for DEP from FY2017-18</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Fiscal Code Bill Makes Few Environmental Changes</strong></div>

<div>In addition to the appropriations bill, the legislature often passes associated &ldquo;code bills&rdquo; that implement the budget across different issues areas. These code bills are often used to move nefarious pieces of legislation that by themselves wouldn&rsquo;t make it through the legislature. For this budget, legislators passed a Fiscal Code, which implements the state budget (House Bill 1929) that only included a few environmental and conservation provisions, including:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Transferred $30.4 million dollars from the Volkswagen (VW) settlement to the General Fund. These funds were provided to Pennsylvania from a settlement that found VW defrauded owners of low-emissions vehicles, resulting in more pollution. These dollars are supposed to be used by the state to reduce air pollution, but the legislature is diverting those funds to balance the budget instead;</li>
	<li>Established a state financial fund to help owners of private dams satisfy financial responsibility obligations under the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act, administered by the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP);</li>
	<li>Allocated $14.5 million in funding through the Commonwealth Financing Authority (CFA) for small water and sewer projects around the Commonwealth;</li>
	<li>Mandated that the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) open and create various ATV trails in northcentral Pennsylvania.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Looking Ahead Through 2018</strong></div>

<div>With the state budget wrapped up on time, the legislature will make themselves scarce in Harrisburg between now and the November elections. A number of big issues are still on the table, including threatened closures of uneconomic nuclear power plants, unsafe pipelines under construction impacting local communities, implementing the state&rsquo;s new building codes, passing community solar legislation, and updating the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS). Furthermore, factions within the legislature are still interested in advancing regulatory rollbacks and dismantling state environmental protections. It&rsquo;s possible these issues may crop up through the end of this year and PennFuture will keep an eye out, particularly in a lame duck session after the elections.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s been an incredibly busy legislative season and I&rsquo;d be remiss without mentioning how important you and your support have been. <strong>This year, our members and supporters have taken countless actions including making calls to legislators, sending letters to your representatives, and organizing in-district meetings on issues around conservation and the environment. Your presence is felt in Harrisburg and is making a difference as we begin reversing decades of cuts, rollbacks, and degradation.</strong></div>

<div></div>

<div>The exact number of jobs is 86,285, and includes jobs in renewable energy (solar and wind), energy efficiency, clean vehicles, battery storage, advanced biofuels, low-impact hydro, and other areas. The surge in clean energy jobs is not confined to one or two regions of the state; there are residents in every countyworking in these fields.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The report also shows that Pennsylvania ranks 11th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the number of clean energy jobs. Sounds pretty good, right? Well, not exactly.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Pennsylvania is the 5th largest state in terms of population according to the <a href=""https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/state-total.html"">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, yet ranks 11th in clean energy jobs. </strong>In contrast, Massachusetts, which has about half the population of Pennsylvania (15th overall), has the 7th highest total of clean energy jobs. Virginia, which ranks 12th in population, has the 10th most clean energy jobs.

<div></div>

<ul>
	<li>Invest in workforce training programs that provide displaced workers and new workforce entrants with skills in clean technology areas, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean transportation.</li>
	<li>Grow the state&rsquo;s green business sector by participating in recruitment trips to the top companies around the country to advocate for expansion or relocation to the Commonwealth.</li>
	<li>Instruct the Department of Community and Economic Development&rsquo;s Manufacturing PA initiative to focus on workforce development and job opportunities in clean energy manufacturing.</li>
	<li>Expand the Department of Labor and Industry&rsquo;s Apprenticeship and Training Office to focus on clean energy trades.</li>
	<li>Develop an in-depth economic plan in concert with strong clean energy policies that includes opportunities for displaced workers, openings for a diverse workforce, considerations for rural and vulnerable communities, and innovative workforce investments.</li>
	<li>Offer active public support and leadership to help pass the Congressional RECLAIM Act, a bipartisan bill, which would allocate funds to reclamation and restoration of land and water resources adversely affected by coal mining, providing Pennsylvania with $67 million annually for five years.</li>
</ul>

<div>Additionally, hundreds of millions of dollars in Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority funding are available to invest in the Commonwealth&rsquo;s clean water infrastructure.

Meet Kelsey Krepps: PennFuture's New Western PA Outreach Coordinator,6/25/2018,"<p>Hey there! My name is Kelsey Krepps, and I am so excited to be back in my home state of Pennsylvania <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/kelsey-krepps"" target=""_blank"">working for an organization that cares so deeply for the issues near and dear to my heart.</a></p>

<p>When I was a child, I thought being green and helping the environment was all about cleaning it up. My babysitter would take my sister and I on walks to our local ice cream stand just a half mile up the road, and on the way, we&rsquo;d pick up all the trash. I loved seeing my handiwork and knowing that I was responsible for making the world just a little bit better. As junior high and high school passed, I participated in numerous clean ups and tree plantings all over Crawford, Venango, and Erie Counties. I loved that these events were a part of my school curriculum, and I like to think of them as me leaving little green thumbprints everywhere I go.</p>

<p>Later, I went to the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford for my undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies &ndash; shocking, I know. One of the greatest things I learned there, though, was the role that environmental issues play in community development. Being green and helping the environment is not an environmental issue, it&rsquo;s a people issue. We don&rsquo;t get to have healthy, thriving communities when we don&rsquo;t live in a healthy, thriving environment. Our families and our health suffer when the environment suffers. Businesses suffer when the environment suffers. Being green is more than cleaning up, it&rsquo;s about preventing the clean ups from needing to happen in the first place. It&rsquo;s about having an active role in how we influence our homes.</p>

<p>I spent the last three years in Boone, North Carolina for graduate school. There, I studied renewable energies like wind and solar, but I also studied the history, natural resources and culture of the Appalachian Region. In Western PA, we have such diverse histories from coal mines in the Southwest to the industries of Pittsburgh to farming in the Northwest and eco-tourism, well, everywhere. I was raised in a farming community just ten minutes away from Titusville, PA &ndash; the birthplace of the oil industry. We can celebrate Pennsylvania&rsquo;s history in fossil fuels and industry while still choosing to create a cleaner, renewable future.</p>

<p>We can be both the clean up crew and the people who protect the policies in place that defend our health, homes, and families from big polluters. We can be both pro-job and pro-environment, creating just transitions for our fossil fuel imbedded neighborhoods. We can be leaders in renewable, clean energy. We can have cleaner air, water, and land. We can speak up about environmental injustice. We can love the communities we&rsquo;re from, while knowing there&rsquo;s still work to be done.</p>

<p>I look forward to meeting you and working with those of you in Western PA and beyond for a more sustainable Pennsylvania. Please feel free to contact me at krepps@pennfuture.org or call me at 412-224&ndash;4477.</p>

PennFuture Secures Victory for Homeowners in PA Supreme Court Case,6/25/2018,"<p>The PA State Supreme Court announced its long-awaited decisionin Gorsline et al. v. Board of Supervisors of Fairfield Township v. Inflection Energy LLC et al., earlier this month, which completes a multi-year journey between PennFuture and its clients, Brian and Dawn Gorsline, and their neighbors, Paul and Michele Batkowski.</p>

<p>PennFuture began representing the Gorslines and Batkowskis in January 2014, when its lawyers appealed a decision by Fairfield Township to issue Inflection Energy a conditional use permit for operation of a shale gas well pad in the residential portion of the municipality&rsquo;s R-A (Residential-Agricultural) zoning district.</p>

<p>To issue the permit, the Township&rsquo;s ordinance required that it conclude that an industrial shale gas well pad was &ldquo;similar to and compatible with&rdquo; other uses allowed in the R-A district. The appeal focused on the company&rsquo;s failure to meet that standard, and that issuing the permit violated our clients&rsquo; constitutional rights.<br />
<br />
The appeal was heard in the Lycoming Court of Common Pleas by Judge Marc F. Lovecchio, who sided with PennFuture and overturned the Township&rsquo;s decision. Recognizing that there were important constitutional issues at play, Judge Lovecchio concluded that Inflection had failed to put on adequate evidence at the local hearing to justify issuance of the permit.<br />
<br />
The Township and Inflection appealed that ruling to the Commonwealth Court.The Commonwealth Court held that the Township was justified in issuing the permit because the ordinance allows &ldquo;public service facilities&rdquo; in all of its zoned districts, and an industrial shale gas well pad was similar to a &ldquo;public service facility.&rdquo; The Court had previously used this rationale in another case to allow a compressor station to be located in a light industrial zoned district.</p>

<p><strong>This case, then, if allowed to stand, would have constituted an outrageous expansion of this rationale that would have swallowed any need for townships to affirmatively regulate where shale gas development would be allowed.</strong> Instead of fulfilling the township&rsquo;s obligations under Article I, Section 27 in choosing where to locate all of the various impacts associated with this vast industry, townships would have been free to issue ad hoc approvals for well pads, processing plants and compressor stations in any of its zoned districts under the ruse that the land use was similar to a &ldquo;public service facility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PennFuture appealed and the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s decision went to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.In its appeal, PennFuture argued that there were four different ways in which the Commonwealth Court made the wrong decision, including that the decision violated Article I, Section 27 of the Constitution and our clients substantive due process rights.</p>

<p><strong>The Supreme Court did not decide the case on the broader constitutional arguments that we made, but did agree with our other three arguments.</strong>The Court held that:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Shale gas development is an industrial land use, and that this industrial land use is not the same as a public service facility;</li>
	<li>Industrial shale gas well pads are not &ldquo;in any material respect&rdquo; similar to and compatible with the other permitted uses in the Township&rsquo;s R-A District;</li>
	<li>The Township could not rely on its earlier decisions to allow shale gas development in its R-A District in order to justify issuance of this permit.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Even though the Court did not decide the case on constitutional bases, the decision established a number of important points.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The Court firmly characterized shale gas development as an industrial land use while rejecting industry&rsquo;s fiction that after construction of the well pads, the facilities have no ongoing impact on public health and the environment.</li>
	<li>The Court rejected the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s finding that shale gas well pads are similar and compatible with &ldquo;public service&rdquo; facilities. The Court recognized that shale gas is a private enterprise that does not directly provide any public service to area residents. This establishes important precedent that precludes townships from using &ldquo;public service facility&rdquo; provisions in existing zoning ordinances for permitting shale gas well pads.</li>
	<li>The Court stated that shale gas development was not materially similar in any manner to other permitted uses in Fairfield Township&rsquo;s R-A District.This finding was very important, because even though the Court did not expressly decide the case on constitutional grounds, the finding has important constitutional implications.When exercising its zoning powers, local government takes away, to one degree or another, private property owners&rsquo; rights to do with their property whatever they choose, and they do that without paying for the taking of those rights. For government to exercise that power constitutionally, the Supreme Court has said that property owners must also benefit from the existence of zoning districts, and that requires that only similar and compatible uses be allowed in each zoned district.Consequently, when zoning for shale gas development, townships must determine and justify what other land uses are similar and compatible with this particular industrial land use. To the extent shale gas development is not similar and compatible with other uses in a particular zoned district, the municipality cannot constitutionally allow shale gas development to occur in the same zoned district.</li>
	<li><strong>Finally, the Court&rsquo;s ruling effectively requires that townships make conscious decisions, with public participation, about how this industry will be regulated on the local level.</strong>It is not adequate to, as did Fairfield Township, permit industrialization of a zoned township on an ad hoc basis. The township must make reasoned decisions that take into account the expectations of its citizenry about the type of land uses that will be allowed in particular zoned districts, and, in the end, those decisions must comport with the state and federal Constitutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s success in this case is not just a long-awaited win for our clients, but a win for concerned residents across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>His trash hauling company, Penn Waste, has incurred fines from at least 30 violations of environmental regulations. He has <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/31/scott-wagner/pa-gopers-climate-change-theory-debunked-nope-not-/"" target=""_blank"">publicly addressed climate change</a>, attributing it to the earth moving ever closer to the sun and the increasing body heat from a growing population.</p>

<p>Environmental policy took a back seat during Governor Wolfs first term. There were a few bright spots.</p>

<p>In the politically complex forum of the Delaware River Basin Commission, Wolf voted with the governors of Delaware and New York in favor of a resolution to place a permanent ban on fracking in the Delaware watershed.</p>

<p>He also signed bipartisan legislation that will put the Pennsylvania solar industry on an equal competitive footing with solar businesses in other states, a welcome recognition of the economic development potential of the clean energy sector.</p>

<p>But neither candidate has laid out anything near a vision or plan for how he will protect Pennsylvanias air and water now; and what he can do to conserve our natural resources for our grandchildren.</p>

<p>Other governors have achieved landmark conservation and environmental protections.</p>

<p>The late Gov. Robert P Casey Sr.s administration successfully promoted one of the first significant investments in conservation with Key 93, a $100 million conservation bond and a permanent fund, the Keystone Recreation, Park and Conservation Fund, which gets its revenue from a portion of the real estate transfer tax.</p>

<p>Former Gov. Tom Ridge created Growing Greener, funded by a fee on garbage dumped at landfills, that provides grants to local organizations for conservation, watershed restoration and recreation projects</p>

<p>Ex-Gov. Ed Rendell signed the first legislation requiring energy suppliers to obtain 18 percent of their power from renewable and alternative energy supplies.</p>

<p>Rendell successfully campaigned for $625 Growing Greener II bond which was overwhelmingly approved by voters, and issued the $650 million Alternative Energy Investment bond, the largest bond for any purpose in state history.</p>

<p>The next governor faces a daunting list of environmental challenges.</p>

<p>The air in many parts of Pennsylvania is among the worse in the nation. We have thousands of miles of streams and rivers which do not support fish or provide clean drinking water.</p>

<p>The legacy of unregulated historic coal mining has left us with 180,000 acres of unproductive, dangerous and ugly polluted land that holds back economic development in coal communities. And Pennsylvania remains a major global source of the pollution that is disrupting the climate.</p>

<p>Neither Wolf nor Wagner will be able to adequately address these problems without a Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) that is fully staffed, adequately funded and independent of political pressure.</p>

<p>The Environmental Rights Amendment puts the responsibility of safeguarding our air, water and future environmental quality squarely at the doorstep of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Protection is the state agency charged with carrying out most of those responsibilities.</p>

<p>The good news is that solutions to our environmental problems abound. Both candidates can find a comprehensive list of policy options in the <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/CCA_2nd-Edition_Web-Version-6.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda</strong></u></a> that contains ideas from 25 of the Commonwealths environmental and conservation organizations.</p>

<p>Both candidates for governor will be bound by the Environmental Rights Amendment to protect our air and water and leave our grandchildren an environment that is at least as good as we now enjoy.</p>

<p>They owe the voters their plans for how they will carry out that duty.</p>

",,
A New Strategy for Sparking Environmental Leadership in Pennsylvania,5/29/2018,"<div>I&rsquo;m sure many of you, like me, are thinking very hard these days about how to cross the divide between our personal views toward our planet&rsquo;s future, and those held by people with very different views. How can an issue like a safe and healthy environment be viewed as a special interest, when such an issue is in everyone&rsquo;s interest?</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>That&rsquo;s the question PennFuture and 25 of our colleague organizations took up this past winter as we sat down to craft the <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Updated-Final-Version-of-the-PA-Common-Conservation-Agenda-5.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda, </a>released this month. </strong>Our goal with the document was to first unite our diverse movement under the banner of the Common Agenda, a document that set forth a nonpartisan, pragmatic and achievable path forward to make real progress &ndash; and in a pretty short time period &ndash; toward clean air, pure water and a healthy climate, so our state can prosper and our economy thrive.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The second question we asked ourselves was, in addition to getting our diverse community to agree on a common agenda, what did the Common Agenda need to look like for the highest elected official in our state &ndash; our governor &ndash; to find his way into parts of it and provide the kind of leadership the people of Pennsylvania are asking for?</div>

<div></div>

<div>Lastly, to the end of political leadership, we decided the platform for opportunity and influence was the upcoming campaign for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s governor and getting the candidates&rsquo; embrace of the agenda our aim. And so, to support the Common Agenda, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/greenin18"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>we have launched PennFuture&rsquo;s Green in &rsquo;18 campaign</strong></u></a>. More on that in a moment.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>The Common Agenda bears down on seven major points that we are asking the gubernatorial candidates to consider and act on:</strong></div>

<ol>
	<li>Strengthening the 21st century workforce through green jobs;</li>
	<li>Championing the great waters of Pennsylvania from source to tap;</li>
	<li>Providing the PA Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources with sufficient resources to fulfill their missions;</li>
	<li>Improving the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s ability to protect the public from the threats posed by natural gas and petrochemical infrastructure;</li>
	<li>Ensuring environment justice for vulnerable communities;</li>
	<li>Boosting current investments in the Growing Greener program, which protects our forests and farmland, restores watersheds and saves wildlife habitat; and</li>
	<li>Bolstering the state&rsquo;s clean energy sector.</li>
</ol>

<div>We have a big task in front of us &ndash; to convince the candidates &ndash; Governor Tom Wolf and State Senator Scott Wagner -- to speak up on these issues and to present their plans to voters for a better environment for us all.This is where you come in &ndash; you, the champions of your community&rsquo;s air and water&hellip;you, the voter.<a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/green18/index.html"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>Become part of our Green in &rsquo;18 campaign.</strong></u></a>There is much work to be done and here&rsquo;s how you can help.We need volunteers to participate in the Green in &rsquo;18 campaign and advance the Common Agenda.We need folks who can devote substantial time to the agenda, participate in training and see it through all the way to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s general election on November 6, 2018.There are other volunteer opportunities as well, so join in and be part of something really big and important for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment.<a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/green18/index.html"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>You can sign up to help here, and once you do, a member of the Green in &rsquo;18 staff will contact you.</strong></u></a></div>

<div>The Common Agenda has knitted together the environmental community, and is attracting new endorsers every day as business and other groups sign on to support it. The solutions it presents were crafted to appeal to a broad cross section of our state, regardless of political affiliation, geographic location, urban or rural settings &ndash; and to appeal to the gubernatorial candidates. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/green18/index.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>Join in to help shine a brighter spotlight on these important environmental solutions today.</strong></a></div>

Join the Second Annual Susquehanna River Rally in Harrisburg!,5/29/2018,"<p>Environmental organizations including National Parks Conservation Association, PennFuture, the Choose Clean Water Coalition, Sierra Club Pennslvania and the Susquehanna River Trails Associationand activists are joining together for the Second Annual Susquehanna River Rally Saturday, June 9, to create a mass call for clean water funding as state budget negotiations commence.</p>

<p>The rally is calling for increased clean water funding as state budget talks begin to ramp up in the coming weeks in Harrisburg. In Pennsylvania, there is no dedicated fund for clean water, and the PA Department of Environmental Protection has had its budget slashed 40 percent over the last 15 years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ensuring clean, safe drinking water is vital to all Pennsylvanians. Proposed cuts to existing funding streams that support the Susquehanna and its rivers and streams would be detrimental to families across the state,&rdquo; said Mariah Davis, Field Manager for the Choose Clean Water Coalition. &ldquo;Our aim is to empower environmental advocates and citizens through collective action so that their voices are heard, and our natural resources have improved protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attendees will enjoy food, music, prizes, guest speakers, and plenty of fun kayaking on the river!</p>

<p><strong>What: </strong>Second Annual River Rally<br />
<strong>When:</strong> Saturday, June 9&ndash; 1 p.m. &ndash; 3:30 p.m.<br />
<strong>Where: </strong>City Island, Harrisburg, PA 17101 &ndash; Beach House Area</p>

<p><strong>Partner organizations will provide 30 boats and kayaks on a first come, first served basis. <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/susquehanna-river-rally-tickets-45990517877"" target=""_blank"">Click here to register for this event!</a></strong></p>

<p>The Susquehanna River serves as a source of drinking water for nearly 6 million people, and this is our reminder to legislators that the health and vitality of our rivers is essential to both the health and economy of our Commonwealth. For too long, Pennsylvania has been lagging behind in our effort to clean up the Susquehanna River, which ultimately leads into the Chesapeake Bay, and our current status of the Phase III Watershed implementation Plan highlights these defects.</p>

<p>Amanda John Kimsey, the Pennsylvania and Delaware Program Manager for National Parks Conservation Association highlighted these sentiments: &ldquo;Despite its immense ecological, economic, historical and public health value, the Susquehanna River is impaired and many Pennsylvania legislators continue to work against its restoration. This incredible waterway offers us abundant recreation, brings water to our tap, and serves as an economic engine for communities along its banks. We look forward to joining arm in arm with river advocates at the 2018 Susquehanna River Rally to holdlegislators accountable to protecting this important river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Please join us in supporting our natural resources and protecting our waterways!</p>

"Philadelphia’s Green City, Clean Waters Needs Funding to Achieve Goals",5/29/2018,"<p>Philadelphia is known as a leader when it comes to using rain gardens, tree trenches, and green roofs to reduce stormwater overflows that pollute local waterways.These practices and others, known as <strong>green stormwater infrastructure</strong>, allow water to naturally soak into soil or evaporate into the air without carrying pollutants into our streams and rivers. At the same time, they provide residents with cleaner air, more attractive parks and streets, and a healthier community.</p>

<p><strong>Philadelphia committed itself to accomplishing significant stormwater overflow reductions through a 25-year plan focused on green practices, known as the Green City, Clean Waters.</strong>In the first five years of the program, Philadelphia surpassed the expectations set for the program, creating over 800 &ldquo;greened acres&rdquo; across the city.Some of these projects have taken place on public property, such as the Mill Creek Playground where basketball courts were retrofitted with porous asphalt over an infiltration bed or Liberty Lands Park where a rain garden detention pond was installed to collect runoff from the site and an adjacent street.But from its beginning, Green City, Clean Waters contemplated the necessity of private development and investment in the success of the program.The Philadelphia Water Department has encouraged private investment in green stormwater infrastructure through regulatory changes&mdash;for example all new and/or redevelopment sites disturbing more than 15,000 square feet of earth must to infiltrate, retain, or treat the first inch of stormwater&mdash;as well as through grant incentive programs like the Stormwater Management Incentive Program (SMIP) and Greened Acre Retrofit Program (GARP).</p>

<p>These grant programs provide funding to private land owners and developers for the construction of stormwater retrofit projects on private property.This allows the Philadelphia Water Department to take compliance credit for greened acres on private project sites that would otherwise be inaccessible to the agency and at a cheaper price than it would cost the Philadelphia Water Department to build equivalent projects on public property.These programs are so successful that the Philadelphia Water Department is asking the Philadelphia Water, Sewer, and Stormwater Rate Board to increase the Department&rsquo;s budget for these programs.</p>

<p>PennFuture, along with the Natural Resource Defense Council, <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/20180525-PF---NRDC-comments-on-2018-rate-proceeding.pdf""><u><strong>submitted comments to the Rate Board</strong></u></a> detailing the importance of Green City, Clean Waters, the grant incentive programs, and predictable funding to the Philadelphia Water Department to be able to achieve its goals. We look forward to continuing this work. Please follow our blogs for upcoming updates.</p>

What the Volkswagen Settlement Means for PA,5/18/2018,"<p>Back in 2014, it was discovered that certain diesel Volkswagen vehicles met the required emissions standards during the official Federal Test Procedure, but produced almost 40 times the smog-forming oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), when driven on the road.</p>

<p>Eventually, Volkswagen admitted to installing an illegal &ldquo;defeat device&rdquo; on 11 million vehicles that would deactivate the emissions controls when it sensed the car wasn&rsquo;t being tested.</p>

<p>The ensuing worldwide scandal resulted in a number of criminal charges and civil suits.In the U.S. alone, the company has agreed to pay around $20 billion in penalties and settlements.One part of these settlements is known as the &ldquo;Environmental Mitigation Trust.&rdquo;It&rsquo;s a pool of money intended to mitigate the damages from pollution caused by these vehicles.<a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Statement-New-State-Program-Will-Advance-Clean-Air-Projects"" target=""_blank""><strong>Out of that pool, Pennsylvania has been allocated a little over $118.5 million.</strong></a></p>

<p>This is not the same as the $30.4 million settlement Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced in March of 2017.While that was also intended to mitigate environmental damages, the Legislature -- through last year&rsquo;s fiscal code -- required that money be deposited in the General Fund, and it&rsquo;s not clear how that has benefited the environment.</p>

<p>The Environmental Mitigation Trust program works a bit differently.Here, the PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is the lead agency and they will review proposed projects, certify if they meet the conditions of the State Trust Agreement, and request funds for specific eligible projects.</p>

<p>The DEP has made its Beneficiary Mitigation Plan available online, but they have not yet announced that the program is open for applications.Still, it&rsquo;s not too early to start thinking about potential projects.<strong>Funding will be available for reducing emissions in the following ten categories:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Class 8 Local Trucks and Port Drayage Trucks</li>
	<li>Class 4-8 School Busses, Shuttle Busses, or Transit Busses</li>
	<li>Railroad Freight Switcher Locomotives</li>
	<li>Ferries/Tugs</li>
	<li>Ocean Going Vessels Shorepower</li>
	<li>Class 4-7 Local Freight Trucks</li>
	<li>Airport Ground Support Equipment</li>
	<li>Forklifts</li>
	<li>Light-Duty Zero Emission Vehicle Supply Equipment</li>
	<li>Matching funds for projects eligible under the Diesel Emission Reduction Act</li>
</ol>

<p>Within these categories, the DEP has said that &ldquo;consideration will be given to distributing project funding statewide, as appropriate, primarily based on the cost-effectiveness and the quantity of NOX emission reductions.&rdquo; While replacing fossil fuel engines with electric alternatives will probably result in the largest overall emissions reductions, this focus primarily on NOx emissions will mean that many of the funded projects could involve replacing or retrofitting diesel engines with natural gas engines.</p>

<p><strong>While there likely are cases where natural gas engines are the best available choice for a given application, PennFuture has encouraged the DEP to look beyond just the dollars per ton of NOx removed.</strong>Instead, we have asked that it puts more emphasis on projects that will build clean energy infrastructure or otherwise speed the market transformation to electric vehicles and other cleaner alternatives.This would be in keeping with the DEP&rsquo;s trust responsibility under Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Environmental Rights Amendment.</p>

<p>Hopefully, DEP will take this advice, but this likely isn&rsquo;t something it can make happen on their own.We need companies and individuals considering electric vehicles, EV infrastructure, or similar projects to apply for funding as soon as it becomes available.We don&rsquo;t know how long this pool of money will last, but when it&rsquo;s gone so is the opportunity.</p>

Protect Your Forests: 2018 Farm Bill Update,5/16/2018,"<p>Sustainable agriculture, forestry, and clean water take center stage this week as the Farm Bill debates begin in the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>The Farm Bill is the largest federal source of conservation funding on private and public land. Over the past half-century, the Farm Bill has done much to support landowners and farmers in Pennsylvania who want to improve water quality and conserve wildlife habitat on their lands. The current Farm Bill&rsquo;s (Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2014) authorization expires at the end of September, and the legislation currently under consideration would provide funding through 2023.</p>

<p>The House is poised to push through and vote on the House version of the Farm Bill later this week. In what is typically a bipartisan effort to craft legislation to help our farmers, low-income communities, and conservation work every four years, <strong>this bill is ideological and harmful.</strong> It is problematic due to its cuts in protections and funding for the environment and conservation along with draconian work requirements for recipients of the SNAP program.</p>

<p><strong>The Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2) is replete with attacks on bedrock environmental laws and America&rsquo;s national forests.</strong> The House Farm Bill includes numerous categorical exemptions from public input and environmental review on forestry projects and incentivizes logging over clean water, recreation, and wildlife. Further, H.R. 2 undermines the National Environmental Policy Act.</p>

<p>The bill goes back on a long-sought-after and hard-won bipartisan fire funding compromise signed into law only a few months ago as a part of the Fiscal Year 2018 Omnibus Appropriations Act. This partisan, one-sided farm bill goes on to attack the Roadless Area Conservation Rule by creating a loophole that allows logging and costly road-building in protected and precious roadless forest areas, such as parts of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Allegheny National Forest in the northwest.</p>

<p>H.R. 2 also attacks the Endangered Species Act by removing a requirement for expert consultation regarding endangered species and critical habitat. We need the Forest Service to consider how water, soil, and wildlife are affected by large-scale projects &ndash; not cut back on protections and reviews to favor the industry. We must keep public lands in public hands. All Americans deserve a say in how these lands are managed, not just those out to make a buck.</p>

<p>As it stands, the House bill&rsquo;s conservation title is a solid start, but it could be stronger. We are pleased with the five million acre increase in the conservation reserve program, the increase in funding for the easement program and the continuation of the Regional Conservation Partnership Program. However, the bill cuts nearly $800 million from the conservation title over a ten-year period&mdash;this funding needs to be restored.</p>

<p><strong>Please ask your Member of Congress and Senators <a href=""https://www.casey.senate.gov/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Casey</a> and <a href=""https://www.toomey.senate.gov/"" target=""_blank"">Pat Toomey</a> to oppose the House Farm Bill (H.R. 2) federal forestry provisions and to speak out publicly against the egregious attacks on American&rsquo;s wild national forests. </strong>We ask that our Representatives and Senators work towards a bipartisan bill with strong forestry and conservation titles that are free from provisions that will put in jeopardy our lands, water, and wildlife.</p>

A Recap of the 2018 PA Clean Water Lobby Day,5/14/2018,"<p>PennFuture recently teamed up with our partners from the Chose Clean Water Coalition (CCWC) and the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed (CDRW) to stand side by side to address an issue critical to us all: clean water.</p>

<p>In total, 26 members from our groups came together April 30 during the PA Clean Water Lobby Day to educate lawmakers in a great series of meetings which highlighted the importance of clean water.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, our discussions with elected officials centered around Pennsylvania&rsquo;s need for a dedicated clean water fund, proper funding for our state resource agencies like the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, and asking that Pennsylvaniastart doing its fair share of fully funding our state water basin commissions,such as the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, Delaware River Basin Commission, Interstate Commission for the Potomac River Basin, and the Ohio River Sanitary Authority Commission.</p>

<p>The day was a huge success, thanks in large part tothe phenomenal advocates and professionals we work alongside. But, this time next year, we want to think bigger and better. Our goal is to have environmental advocates from throughout the Commonwealth unite in the Capitol Main Rotunda with the singular message of protecting life&rsquo;s most precious natural resource: water.</p>

<p>We want to thank the speakers who came out and expressed what clean water means to them, including:Marel King of Chesapeake Bay Commission, Rep. Mike Sturla, 96th District, Member of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, Rep. Leanne Krueger-Braneky, Delaware - 161st Legislative District, PennFuture President and CEO JacquelynBonomo, Mariah Davis, Field Manager &ndash; Choose Clean Water Coalition, Madeline Emde, State Policy Manager &ndash; Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed,Stephanie Wein, Water &amp; Conservation Advocate &ndash; PennEnvironment, andJackson, Clean Water Supply Associate &ndash; American Rivers.

The New Tax Law and Charitable Giving,5/14/2018,"<div><em>Note: The information presented here is for educational and informational purposes only. Please consult your personal financial advisor and/or attorney on all legal, tax, or financial issues related to your charitable giving.</em></div>

<div></div>

<div>Since the tax law changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed last year, there has been much discussion about how it will affect charitable giving. Some have even speculated that the changes will greatly hurt nonprofit organizations, such as PennFuture, who rely on your support. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The <strong>good news</strong> is that there are key tax code provisions which will continue to <strong>impact charitable giving in favorable ways.</strong> You can still enjoy important tax benefits while meeting your charitable goals.</div>

<div></div>

<div>How the new tax cuts affect you depends on many factors, including family size, available deductions, and income. And, of course, <strong>you need to talk with your own financial advisors.</strong> But, here is a brief overview of the key provisions of the new tax law and how it affects charitable giving this year.</div>

<ul>
	<li>The standard deduction increases substantially and fewer people will itemize their taxes. The result? <em><strong>Taxpayers can still realize charitable giving goals and some donors will have even more discretionary funds available for planning.</strong></em></li>
	<li>The amount of charitable cash contributions that can be deducted in any particular year has been increased from 50 percentof adjusted gross income to 60 percentof adjusted gross income. <strong>This is particularly helpful for donors making a large, legacy-shaping gift.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Donor Advised Funds</strong> were not affected by the new law, which means contributions to these funds continue to be deductible when made. Donors can select the timing and amounts of gifts that are made from the fund, just as they have in the past.</li>
	<li>Gifts of retirement assets (including <strong>charitable distributions from an IRA for those age 70&frac12; or over</strong>) remain particularly attractive charitable giving options. The new tax law passed in December 2017 did not change the popular gift option known as the <strong>IRA Charitable Rollover</strong>&mdash;a charitable distribution from your IRA directly to PennFuture. This is good news for IRA owners age 70&frac12; and over who must take a required minimum distribution from their IRA and also want to support our work in 2018. You can use your IRA to make a meaningful gift now and avoid taxes on the IRA distribution. It&rsquo;s easy to do.
	<ul>
		<li>Instruct your IRA custodian to make a distribution directly to PennFuture. The distribution counts toward your required minimum distribution (RMD).</li>
		<li>Although there is no tax deduction, the distribution is excluded from your income for federal tax purposes&mdash;<strong>no tax is due!</strong></li>
		<li>Up to $100,000 of your gift qualifies for this favorable tax treatment.</li>
		<li>Your gift makes an immediate impact<strong>&mdash;<strong>there is no need to wait until the end of the year!</strong></strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For many of our friends, moving beyond the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; gift planning options makes it possible to experience even greater personal benefits. For example, <strong>there are two reasons why a gift of stock may be more advantageous than a gift of cash.</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>There is no capital gains tax due on the appreciated amount.</li>
		<li>The full amount of the gift qualifies for an itemized tax deduction.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<div>Please let us know how we might help you and your advisors explore charitable strategies under the new law. You can always call me directly at 717-214-7924, or email me at <a href=""mailto:dinicola@pennfuture.org"">dinicola@pennfuture.org</a>.</div>

Introducing the Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda and the Green In ’18 Campaign,5/1/2018,"<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/green%2Din%2D18%2Dweb%2Dlogo%2D%2D4%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 650px; height: 175px;"" /></p>

<p><a href=""/Blog-Item-From-the-CEO-PennFuture-Priorities-in-2018"" target=""_blank"">In a December 2017 blog post about PennFuture&rsquo;s 2018 priorities</a>, President and CEO Jacquelyn Bonomo wrote, &ldquo;As part of our new civic engagement program, PennFuture will launch its Green In &rsquo;18 campaign. The campaign will elevate the public discussion around environmental issues in the upcoming elections.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Since then, PennFuture has been working with 20+ environmental, land, air, and water groups and organizations to identify the biggest environment challenges facing Pennsylvania.</strong> <strong>As a result, this coalition has created and agreed upon the most promising policy solutions to these threats. This process led to the creation of the <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Updated-Final-Version-of-the-PA-Common-Conservation-Agenda-5.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank""><u>first-ever Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda</u></a>, a blueprint for restoring and preserving our life-sustaining natural resources.</strong></p>

<p>Not only do these solutions promote a healthier environment and a stronger economy, they are publicly popular, fiscally responsible, and can be enacted by our next Governor using his or her executive authority.In virtually every instance, increases in state spending will be offset through job growth, revenue growth, energy savings, and/or lower healthcare costs.</p>

<p><strong>The agenda was released today during a press conference in Harrisburg, and it will be shared with allcandidates running to be Pennsylvania&rsquo;s next governor.</strong><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Updated-Final-Version-of-the-PA-Common-Conservation-Agenda-5.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>Click here to read it</strong></u></a> and to find out how you can <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/greenin18"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>get involved in the Green in &rsquo;18 campaign</strong></u></a>, which is mobilizing citizens to elevate environmental issues and the policy solutions within the agenda for all candidates running for governor.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why the candidates?</strong></em> We believe the upcoming gubernatorial election represents is an ideal time to push for changes in the state&rsquo;s priorities and policies for safeguarding the environment. So, during the election cycle, coalition members will be taking this agenda to the gubernatorial candidates and urging each one to enact our recommendations if they are elected.</p>

<p><em><strong>Easy, right? </strong></em>If only. In reality, it&rsquo;s going to take more than our efforts alone to get the candidates to consider and ultimately implement our agenda. It&rsquo;s also going to require a groundswell of support from Pennsylvania voters, speaking out on several crucial issues. But while the majority of Pennsylvania citizens think the state should do more to safeguard the environment (<a href=""https://www.fandm.edu/uploads/files/708725106986767486-f-m-poll-release-march-2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"">see results of March 2018 Franklin and Marshall College Poll</a>), the environment is one of many issues voters consider important. To make sure the environment is front and center in the minds ofcitizens and all of the candidates, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/greenin18"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>we will be backing the agenda with the Green In &rsquo;18 campaign.</strong></u></a></p>

<p><strong>PennFuture&rsquo;s new Green in &lsquo;18 campaign will be reaching out to citizens, community groups, and businesses to let them know about the policy solutions we are advocating as a coalition. </strong>We have a simple message: a healthy environment is best for everyone in Pennsylvania&mdash;children, families, workers, retirees, businesses&mdash;now and those yet to come. And the Common Conservation Agenda is the most feasible way to restore and preserve our state&rsquo;s environment.</p>

<p>Through this process, we hope to increase the urgency of environmental issues in citizens minds, earn their support for the agenda, and motivate them to attend candidates&rsquo; events to ask those candidates where they stand on the environment, what their plans are to safeguard our air, land, and water, and whether they support the agenda. This is the type of pressure that will force the candidates to address our concerns and prioritize clean air, pure water, and a healthy climate.</p>

<p><em><strong>How can you get involved? </strong></em>For our movement to succeed, we need friends of the environment like you to volunteer to help with the Green In &rsquo;18 campaign. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/green18/index.html"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>You can fill out the form available here to get started.</strong></u></a></p>

What Act 40 Means for Solar Energy in PA,4/26/2018,"<p><em><strong>UPDATE:PUC&rsquo;s final implementation order on the solar borders issue was released May 3. <a href=""http://www.puc.pa.gov/pcdocs/1565100.docx"" target=""_blank"">Click here to read more.</a></strong></em></p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-Pennsylvania-Public-Utility-Commission-Removes-Barriers-to-Solar-Growth"">On Thursday, April 19, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) took an important step forward</a> and removed a long-standing barrier that kept solar projects from being built in Pennsylvania. In a unanimous vote, the PUC implemented the bipartisan Act 40 to require solar-credited projects under the state Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) be built in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>While Pennsylvania is traditionally a leader on developing and installing new energy sources, we have been lagging behind surrounding states when it comes to deploying solar energy.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania ranked 19th behind Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Ohio in the most recent <a href=""https://www.thesolarfoundation.org/national/""><strong>Solar Jobs Report.</strong></a>The Commonwealth is ranked 39th in solar jobs per capita. Massachusetts alone had about three times more solar jobs than Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why Pennsylvania lags behind.One issue is that the solar alternative energy credit program (SAEC*) part of our AEPS has much lower targets than many nearby states. Pennsylvania requires 0.5% solar energy by 2021 compared to 4.1% by 2028 in New Jersey, 2.5% by 2020 in Maryland, and 8.4% by 2030 in New York.Compounding the problem, Pennsylvania was one of the only states in the region with &ldquo;open borders&rdquo; that allowed solar from anywhere on our electric grid -- encompassing 13 surrounding states and the District of Columbia -- to be used for compliance.This lowered the value of SAECs in the state, meaning solar jobs went elsewhere.According to the most recent AEPS report, more than 60% of SAECs in 2017 came from out of state.</p>

<p>Last December, Governor Wolf signed into law Act 40, a bipartisan bill that requires solar-credited projects to be built in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, the PUC originally proposed to implement the bill in a way that would make it almost completely ineffective and still allow projects to be sourced outside of the state. This changed last week when all five PUC commissioners voted in favor of a joint statement by Chairman Brown and Vice Chairman Place that reversed that decision.</p>

<p>Going forward, new credits must now come from facilities connected to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s distribution system. Specifically, Act 40 changes the following depending on when a solar project was credited under the AEPS:</p>

<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/solarblog%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 671px; height: 389px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>What does this mean for the value of my SAECs?</strong></p>

<p>Since Act 40 was signed by the governor, SAEC prices have risen from about $6 to around $11, but it&rsquo;s unclear how much of that is attributable to the change in law. Because a relatively large amount of credits are banked, most in the industry are not expecting to see the full impact of this rule for at least two more years. Still, Act 40 is a good start and will lead to more solar projects in Pennsylvania in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have taken a step in the right direction, Pennsylvania should make the commitment to becoming a solar leader. We have a lot of tools at our disposal to get there; some things to consider include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Increasing the AEPS solar target to be more in line with surrounding states.</li>
	<li>Enabling Community Solar so families and businesses that can&rsquo;t install their own solar panels have meaningful access to solar.</li>
	<li>Encouraging more and better financing options for solar.</li>
	<li>Making sure solar gets the same state tax benefits that fossil fuel projects enjoy.</li>
	<li>Ensuring energy purchases fully account for public health and environmental costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture is working with the PA DEP, US Department of Energy, industry experts, and over 450 stakeholders to evaluate options like these, but even the best ideas are not going to get implemented without strong public support.</p>

Public Comment Closes on DRBC Fracking Regulations,4/24/2018,"<p>On March 30, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) closed its four-month public comment period on proposed regulations of fracking and fracking-related activities.The DRBC received 227 oral comments over sixpublic hearings, and over 8,600 written comments, which includes petitions in favor of the proposed ban signed by tens of thousands of individuals.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2018-03-30-PennFuture-Comments-on-DRBC-Fracking-Draft-Regulations.pdf"">PennFuture&rsquo;s comments to the DRBC</a> strongly supported the proposed prohibition on fracking within the Basin, and called on the DRBC to strengthen its proposed regulations on both water withdrawals for fracking outside of the Basin and the transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of fracking wastewater within the Basin. If those regulations cannot be strengthened in order to protect the Delaware River water resources, then the DRBC must not allow these activities to occur.Like PennFuture, it appears that a good number of commenters supported the fracking ban, yet called for stronger regulations of those fracking-related activities to protect our waters.</p>

<p>The majority of the public comments received called for a full ban on all fracking-related activities, including water withdrawals and wastewater treatment. However, there was a large contingent of comments that opposed the proposed ban on fracking, lead primarily by gas industry interests.All written comments received by the DRBC are available for review and download <a href=""http://www.nj.gov/drbc/meetings/proposed/notice_hydraulic-fracturing.html"">through the DRBC&rsquo;s website.</a></p>

<p>The DRBC has no set deadline by which they must make their final decisions to adopt, modify, or reject the proposed fracking regulations. This final decision, however, is likely to take several months, if not longer.The DRBC must not only review each comment in their decision-making process, but must also draft a written comment response document that responds to each type of comment (not each individual comment) submitted.During its review of the comments, DRBC will likely consult with experts and may even possibly conduct additional research. </p>

<p>The DRBC&rsquo;s responses and recommendations will then be submitted to the five Commissioners for a vote. Assuming no changes to the proposed regulations, it seems likely that the regulations will be adopted by the Commissioners, who include the governors of the four Basin states and a representative of the U.S. government.The governors of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York had previously voted to propose the regulations, and the new governor of New Jersey has expressed his support for the fracking ban, making a 4-1 vote in favor of adopting the proposed regulations the most likely outcome.</p>

<p>What this all seems to foreshadow is that, regardless of what the DRBC&rsquo;s final adopted regulations do, there will be legal challenges. If the DRBC adopts the regulations as proposed, it&rsquo;s likely that they will receive challenges from both sides of the aisle &ndash; environmentalists and anti-fracking supporters arguing the regulations didn&rsquo;t go far enough to protect the Delaware River water resources and industry, and pro-fracking supporters arguing that the regulations go too far. </p>

<p>During the pendency of any legal challenges to the DRBC&rsquo;s final regulations regarding fracking in the Basin, the &ldquo;<a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Moratorium-on-Fracking-in-the-Delaware-River-Basin-is-Critical-to-Protect-Our-Water"">de facto moratorium</a>&rdquo; on fracking that has been in place since 2010 will most likely continue, thereby protecting the Delaware River Basin while the issue makes its way through the courts. </p>

<p>In the end, PennFuture is confident that fracking will not be allowed to jeopardize our water, environment, and health within the Delaware River Basin. PennFuture remains committed to protecting the Delaware River Basin and will keep you updated as this matter moves forward. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/newsletter-sign-up"">Please click here to subscribe to our emails for regular updates on this issue.</a></p>

Building a Community Clean Water Toolbox: How PA Will Meet its Goals,4/23/2018,"<p>On April 10, nearly 200 leaders from county conservation districts, agriculture, municipal governments, environmental groups, water companies, and other entities participated in a workshop focused around the state plan for improving water quality in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.</p>

<p>Participants shared their expertise and aided in the development of the Community Clean Water Toolbox to draft policy and suggestions to help Pennsylvania meet its Total Maximum Pollution Reduction (TMDL) goals by 2025.</p>

<p>During the conference, the group learned about planning, engagement, resource, tracking, and implementation tools that would be available to counties for developing and implementing action plans to reduce pollution runoff into our waterways. The areas in focus for initial pilot development are Lancaster, York, Adams, and Franklin County. These counties will lead the way in development and create their action plans by October. After the initial toolbox is created and implemented in these counties, it will then be further modified (as needed) for use by the other counties in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>From this meeting, there are a few points that everyone took home: We need more community engagement, Lancaster County has the most opportunity for pollution reduction in the Commonwealth, and forested riparian buffers are the most cost-effective way of meeting our pollution reduction goals.</p>

<p>In terms of community engagement, it will play a critical role in the state&rsquo;s ability to meet its goals for the plan. The PA Department of Environmental Protection will not be enforcing compliance through regulatory oversight; instead, its aim is to have counties use the numbers presented to them to define pollution reduction goals and identify existing and proposed local initiatives that can be used to help meet them. The end game is having a county-level approach that will lead Pennsylvania in attaining its pollution reduction goals</p>

<p>The second major takeaway from the event centered on the amount of nutrient and sediment runoff in Lancaster County. Due to the lack of trees in the county, and the amount of populated areas coupled with the abundance of farming, Lancaster has earned a reputation as a major load-producing geography that contributes to the condition of the Chesapeake Bay. Because of this, a major focus of the Watershed Implementation Plan Steering Committee is looking at Lancaster and York County as sites for &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; programs that will implement these best management practices (BMP), and then modify them as necessary after the Phase III WIP is set into motion.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Steering Committee showcased a study that indicated riparian buffers to be the most cost-efficient and results-driven form of BMP that can be implemented. Riparian buffers are patches of vegetation and trees surrounding a stream or body of water that helps shade and protect the stream from the impacts of adjacent land uses. Implementing riparian buffers throughout the Commonwealth will aide in the restoration of streams by protecting the fish and inhabitants of the water and provide a natural balance to the ecosystem, because they absorb runoff and cool the temperature of the creeks and streams.</p>

<p>As great as these initiatives are, there is still work that needs to be done. Pennsylvania still remains nearly 60 percent behind schedule for the TMDL, funding sources for implementing clean water projects still seems out of reach, and we are woefully underperforming compared to our neighboring states. However, the leadership shown at this conference is a step in the right direction. Now comes the difficult part &ndash; translating this down to the local level and installing BMP&rsquo;s on time to meet our state goals.</p>

Meet PennFuture's Director of Development: M. Travis DiNicola,4/16/2018,"<div>When you think back on your favorite memories, how many of them took place outdoors?</div>

<div></div>

<div>With most of my memories, I don&rsquo;t recall just the places and people that made a moment special, but the atmosphere. I remember the season&mdash;the rain, the snow, the warmth or coolness of the air. And I remember the light.</div>

<div></div>

<div>About two years ago when my wife and I decided to move back to Pennsylvania to be closer to our families, she asked me what part of coming home was I most excited about. I told her that all of my best memories of summer took place in Pennsylvania. There is something about the atmosphere here that is very special.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Growing up in Erie, I was fortunate to spend much of my youth exploring Presque Isle: going on hikes with my grandfather, biking the trails, windsurfing on the lake, fishing on the bay, canoeing the inlets, and of course, hanging out with friends on the beaches. Presque Isle was my playground. It was there that I discovered my passion for flying stunt kites&mdash;a passion I continue to enjoy today when I fly my kites off the edge of City Island in the middle of the mighty Susquehanna.</div>

<div></div>

<div>After studying theatre and dance as an undergrad and then art and museum education as a graduate student at Penn State, my career took me to Indianapolis. For 20 years, I worked in many capacities there as a champion of mission-based organizations, including arts, education, and community-service groups. I emceed a number of events for environmental organizations, and hosted a monthly &ldquo;climate-change quiz-show&rdquo; for a few years at a local theatre.</div>

<div></div>

<div>I am most proud of the 10 years I spent as the Executive Director of Indy Reads, an adult literacy program. During my tenure, I created Indy Reads Books, a nonprofit bookstore and community arts center in downtown Indianapolis. It was there that I edited and published Indy Writes Books: A Book Lover&rsquo;s Anthology, which features Indiana authors writing about their love of books, bookstores, and reading. While in Indianapolis, I was also fortunate to be the co-host and producer of a weekly arts talk show on the local public radio station.</div>

<div></div>

<div>I greatly enjoyed my time in the Midwest, but it wasn&rsquo;t home. Pennsylvania and its air, mountains, and water&mdash;this is home. This is where my wife and I got married, in the garden of her family&rsquo;s farm that sits on the Conewago. Since coming back to PA, my wife and I have already been creating wonderful new outdoor memories: fly-fishing on Big Spring, kayaking on the Susquehanna, hiking Ricketts Glen, biking on the Capital Area Greenbelt, and kite flying on City Island.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Our natural resources in Pennsylvania are incredible, they should be treasured, and they deserve to be protected. This is why I am so proud to be the new Director of Development for PennFuture. There are few things more important to me than PennFuture&rsquo;s work in protecting our air, water and land. This is a mission that I proudly champion.</div>

<div></div>

<div>As the Director of Development, it is my job to make certain that PennFuture has the funds it needs to be able to fulfill that mission, and to ensure our future sustainability. In this role, I have two very important responsibilities:</div>

<ul>
	<li>To represent PennFuture as best as I can to you, our supporters.</li>
	<li>To represent you as best as I can to PennFuture.</li>
</ul>

<div>My approach to fundraising? It is a two-way street. I will communicate accurate and helpful information to you about the great organization that you have chosen to support.</div>

<div></div>

<div>What can you do? Tell me why PennFuture, and the work we do, is worthy of your support.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The most important thing a Development Director can bring to an organization isn&rsquo;t a big donation, it is your trust. As your representative, it is my pledge to you that I will be transparent and honest in everything I do to further the mission of PennFuture.</div>

<div></div>

State Level Implications of Pruitt's Vehicle Emissions Rollback,4/12/2018,"<p>Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitts attempted rollback of vehicle emissions standards is dangerous, misguided, and will mean dirtier cars and a less competitive auto industry. How do we know this? We have been there before.</p>

<p>Prior to 2008, the auto industry built too many huge and high-profit-margin gas guzzling SUVs rather than a diversified fleet of options for consumers. Their shortsightedness left the industry dangerously exposed to rising gas prices. And, in the end, it took tens of billions of dollars in government aid to save the industry from their own poor choices.</p>

<p>For a time, the industry was ready to admit their fault. They came to the table and negotiated improved fuel economy standards in line with goals set by other countries. Unfortunately, the industry saw an opportunity in Scott Pruitt&rsquo;s anti-regulatory mania to return to their old irresponsible ways. Once again, they are claiming that they just can&rsquo;t make and sell cleaner cars. Even though cleaner vehicles will save American consumers over a trillion dollars in fuel costs and billions more in health and environmental benefits, far outweighing the additional $50 it might add to the sticker price, Pruitt is ready to hand his lobbyist pals whatever they ask for.</p>

<p>The EPA has a lot of power in this area. Section 209(a) of the Clean Air Act has a &ldquo;federal preemption&rdquo; provision that says &ldquo;no state...shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles&hellip;&rdquo; Fortunately, however, California was regulating emissions from vehicles long before the EPA, so the Clean Air Act allows them to continue to do so under a 209(b) waiver as long as their program is no less stringent than the federal one. The Act also gives other states the ability to choose between the EPA&rsquo;s program and the California one. Twelve states, including Pennsylvania, have opted into the California program.</p>

<p>No one thinks it&rsquo;s ideal to have two different programs. In fact, one of the purposes of the &ldquo;Tier III&rdquo; emissions controls that are at issue was to harmonize the standards. Now though, instead of continuing with the agreed-upon standards, anti-environmental and anti-regulatory activists are asking Pruitt to revoke the California waiver. If he does, that would leave Pennsylvania with no choice but to accept more pollution from our cars and worse gas mileage.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s bad enough, but there are additional complications. Pennsylvania made its clean vehicle program part of its &ldquo;State Implementation Plan&rdquo; (SIP) for meeting federal ozone standards. Currently, 17 of our counties are out of compliance and we need to demonstrate we are adopting permanent, quantifiable, and enforceable emissions reductions to clean up their air. This SIP program also contains an &ldquo;anti-backsliding&rdquo; provision, where losing an enforceable strategy, like the clean vehicle program, requires the state to find something else to take its place.</p>

<p>As Pennsylvanians, we have a right to clean air, but we also expect our government to pick the most cost-effective programs to achieve that goal. Even though vehicles are responsible for about a third of the pollution in the state and the clean car program is highly cost effective, federal preemption means we can&rsquo;t regulate them on our own -- we need the California waiver. If Pruitt revokes that, we may need to get additional emissions reductions from businesses in the state -- no matter what the cost.</p>

Maya K. van Rossum: Woman of the Delaware River Watershed,4/5/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Maya K. van Rossum</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Maya is receiving the Woman of the Delaware River Watershed award at <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">PennFutures Fourth Annual Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards</a> on April 19 in Philadelphiafor her protection of the watershed through advocacy and leadership at Delaware Riverkeeper Network.</strong></em></p>

<p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I grew up in the Delaware River watershed, playing in Ithan Creek, a tributary to the Darby Creek, which is a tributary to the Delaware. I remember playing for hours in the water, squishing my feet in the sandy soils on its banks, walking through the culvert that carried the creek under the road, and sitting quietly under a tree with big sprawling roots and branches, just watching the water go quietly by. I guess this is the time and place when my love for our beautiful watershed was born and grew its own roots. Watching the damage inflicted on the creeks, forests and animals of my community is when I learned that nature needs a voice in our human world, and without it, nature is truly at the mercy of people.</p>

<p>The Delaware Riverkeeper Network was formed in 1988 when our watershed residents, like I did as a child, recognized that the Delaware River, its tributaries and natural communities need people who will give it a voice in our human community, to ensure it gets the highest level of protection.</p>

<p>For 24 years, I have had the honor of leading the Delaware Riverkeeper Network and of bearing the title of the Delaware Riverkeeper. But of course, championing the rights of our river and communities to free flow, health, and abundant life is not the job of one person; it is the job of a community. That is what the Delaware Riverkeeper Network is all about: creating and supporting the community willing to stand up and both speak and act in defense of our river and watershed.</p>

<p>The most rewarding aspect of this award for me is that residents from communities I work with nominated me. Every day, I have the honor of working with people who care deeply about our natural resources and one another. They are threatened by toxic contamination, threatened by the taking of their property for a pipeline, fearful that fracking will be allowed to come to our watershed and devastate their lives, suffering from growing flooding, or worried about the loss of a special species. These are people with tremendous integrity, strength and spirit. That these people took the time out of their busy lives and away from the environmental cause they are working so hard on to nominate me, is the greatest honor.</p>

<p>With so many challenges facing our River and communities, it can be easy to lose sight of the progress and successes we have achieved with our watershed community. The Delaware Riverkeeper Network in 1989 submitted and advocated a petition before the Delaware River Basin Commission that changed the course of our River&rsquo;s history. The petition and supporting advocacy resulted in the creation of the Special Protection Waters program, giving highest legal protection to the Middle and Upper Delaware. A second petition we submitted in 2001 extended that protection to the Lower Delaware River, resulting in the longest stretch of river anywhere in the nation (197 miles) with this highest level of protection. In 2010, it is this protection that became the basis of the moratorium that has protected our Delaware River watershed from drilling and fracking operations, including the water withdrawals and wastewater storage and disposal. Today, we are working hard to make these protections complete and permanent.</p>

<p>The Delaware Riverkeeper Network was the lead plaintiff with the American Littoral Society (of whom the organization was originally a part) in the case that resulted in Pennsylvania and Delaware implementing the Total Maximum Daily Load regulations (TMDLs) required by the Clean Water Act, and is now the basis of the often applauded Chesapeake Bay TMDL. Until our litigation and settlement, this critical portion of the law had been ignored by both states.</p>

<p>The Delaware Riverkeeper Network has been instrumental in protecting the horseshoe crabs of the Delaware Bay and River&rsquo;s genetically unique population of Atlantic sturgeon; defeating dam proposals and having them replaced with more beneficial strategies; advancing strong stormwater and development strategies; and more.</p>

<p>Most recently, I have been advancing a national Green Amendment movement. My new book, titled <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Green-Amendment-Securing-Healthy-Environment/dp/1633310213""><strong>The Green Amendment</strong></a>, tells the story of how the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, working with seven towns, secured the constitutional right of the people of Pennsylvania to pure water, clean air and a healthy environment by breathing legal life into the long ignored constitutional provision.</p>

<p>The legal victory achieved in 2013 in the case Robinson Twp., Delaware Riverkeeper Network v. Commonwealth, not only defeated a very damaging pro-fracking piece of legislation, but has since been used by my organization and communities throughout the state to protect the rights of communities to a healthy environment in those situations when the state has itself, or through the actions of others, overstepped to infringe upon those rights. The value of this victory should not stop at the borders of Pennsylvania. I see a vision for inspiring the whole nation to follow Pennsylvania&rsquo;s lead and to seek and secure constitutional provisions in every state in the nation and at the federal level that recognize and protect the right to a healthy environment as inalienable rights with the same level of protection we give other fundamental rights like the right to free speech and freedom of religion. My deepest hope is that we start a Green Amendment movement that sweeps the nation.</p>

Reality Check: Supreme Court Decision on Water Pollution No Cause for Alarm,3/29/2018,"<p>There has already been a fair amount written about a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision issued yesterday involving the state&rsquo;s effort to penalize EQT under the Clean Streams Law (CSL) for allowing a shale gas wastewater impoundment to leak and contaminate groundwater in Tioga County in 2012.</p>

<p>As an initial matter, it should be noted that the Supreme Court <em><strong>did not</strong></em> decide that the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s (DEP&rsquo;s) proposed $4.5 million dollar penalty was excessive.Because of how this case made its way to the Supreme Court, the reasonableness of DEP&rsquo;s proposed civil penalty was not before the Court for a decision.</p>

<p>This case arose from a complaint that EQT filed in Commonwealth Court after DEP had presented EQT with a proposed civil penalty calculation based in part on groundwater contamination that resulted from operation of the impoundment.EQT asked the Commonwealth Court, under a statute known as the Declaratory Judgments Act, to decide an issue of law - <strong>whether penalties continued to accrue under the CSL so long as pollutants remained in groundwater.</strong></p>

<p>The Commonwealth Court initially dismissed the complaint on procedural grounds, but the Supreme Court disagreed and returned the matter for a decision. On remand, the Commonwealth Court ruled in favor of EQT and DEP appealed that decision back to the Supreme Court.<strong>So, the question before the Supreme Court was a relatively narrow one about how to interpret the CSL, and not about the reasonableness of DEP&rsquo;s proposed civil penalty.</strong></p>

<p>Regarding that legal question, the Supreme Court made a number of pronouncements. <strong>First, it held that the mere presence of pollution in groundwater does not, in and of itself, constitute a violation of the CSL.</strong>The Court said that the touchstone of a violation under the CSL was the introduction of pollutants into the waters of the Commonwealth - not their continued presence in those waters. </p>

<p><strong>Second, the Supreme Court addressed what came to be known as DEP&rsquo;s &ldquo;water-to-water theory&rdquo; of liability.</strong> Under this theory, the state asserted the right to assess a penalty when the contaminants moved from one discrete body of water into another, such as when pollutants moved from groundwater into surface water, or into areas of uncontaminated groundwater. The Court rejected DEP&rsquo;s argument that it could impose a penalty based on the movement of contaminants within bodies of water, or from one body of water to another.</p>

<p><strong>Third, the Supreme Court rejected the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s interpretation that Section 401 of the CSL did not regulate industrial waste.</strong> Section 401 prohibits any person who owns or occupies property from discharging any substance of any kind into waters of the Commonwealth causing pollution. This was a pretty big deal, because the Commonwealth Court badly mangled and narrowed its application based on the title of the section and little more.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, the Supreme Court declined to speak to the third theory, upon which DEP based its penalty assessment, namely the so-called &ldquo;soil-to-water theory.&rdquo; </strong>Under this theory, an ongoing violation occurs for each day that pollutants are released from soil into the waters of the Commonwealth. The EHB applied a variation on this theory in issuing a $1.1 million dollar penalty for this incident. Both DEP and EQT have appealed that decision to the Commonwealth Court.<strong>The Court&rsquo;s ruling against the agency on its water-to-water theory may seem concerning at first, but there are reasons why it should, in the end, not substantially impact DEP&rsquo;s ability to protect our streams and rivers. </strong></p>

<p><strong>First, it is important to understand that this case was about penalties, not about the state&rsquo;s ability to prevent or clean up pollution.</strong>Penalties serve an important purpose, but DEP has many other tools to use in ensuring protection and prompt clean-up of water pollution. And the Court made clear that its decision was not intended to limit DEP&rsquo;s use of those tools.</p>

<p>Second, this case concerned one type of penalty - a civil monetary penalty. If the state believed that a pollution event was so egregious that a civil monetary penalty did not adequately address the extent of harm or sufficiently deter future conduct, then DEP could seek to impose criminal penalties on the responsible parties.</p>

<p>Third, the state could use its administrative powers to effectively implement its water-to-water theory.</p>

<p>The argument that DEP made in court was that as pollution migrated from one water body to another, a separate violation of the CSL occurred. Consider, for example, a factory that grossly contaminated groundwater on its property, and over time, that pollution also threatened to leak into a nearby stream. The Supreme Court said that the release of pollution to the groundwater was a violation, but not migration of that pollution to another body of water.</p>

<p>However, DEP has authority, based on the initial violation, to issue a compliance order preventing the spread of that contamination.So, if it issued an order to the responsible party to prevent the discharge of pollution to the stream, and the pollution subsequently made it into the stream, that would constitute a violation of DEP&rsquo;s order, which in turn also constitutes a violation of the CSL.</p>

<p><strong>By using its administrative tools, DEP has the ability to protect, in this scenario, the stream, and penalize the actor whose conduct threatened its harm.</strong></p>

<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision may alter how the DEP approaches pollution incidents. The agency may need to rethink how it collects evidence and proves that there is an ongoing discharge of pollutants to waters of the Commonwealth. It may need to rethink how to use its other tools to ensure protection of other bodies of water associated with the initial release of pollutants.</p>

<p>Finally, the DEP may need to reconsider the role that criminal penalties should play in altering the conduct of persons who harm the waters of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p><strong>In the end, however, this Supreme Court decision should not have a substantial impact on the state&rsquo;s ability to protect the waters of the Commonwealth and punish those who cause them harm.</strong></p>

Q&A – Christina Simeone: Woman of Renewable Energy & Climate,3/28/2018,"<p><em><strong>The Woman of Renewable Energy &amp; Climate Award will be presented to Christina Simeone at the <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">2018 Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards</a> April 19 in Philadelphia, for her accomplishments and leadership as the director of policy and external affairs at Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Q. Where did you grow up?<br />
A. </strong>I grew up in Philadelphia, home of the Super Bowl-winning Eagles, and the greatest cheesesteaks in all of the land, from John&rsquo;s Roast Pork (on Snyder Avenue).</p>

<p><strong>Q. Can you describe your educational background?<br />
A. </strong>Bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in economics, and a second degree in music industry (majoring in opera), and a master&rsquo;s degree in environmental studies, focusing on science and policy. I have very understanding parents.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What first inspired you to work in conservation?<br />
A.</strong> It was a process of elimination and self-discovery, more Goldilocks than grandeur. I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted to do when I was younger. After college, I began working in the financial management industry, which was lucrative, but didn&rsquo;t feel quite right to me. I went back to school for music, while working on the corporate side of the music industry. This was an extremely cool experience, but not intellectually fulfilling, and the Metropolitan opera wasn&rsquo;t exactly knocking on my door.I wanted the right combination of mental engagement, personal fulfillment, and economic stability. I spent the majority of my childhood on farms, riding horses, and enjoying the outdoors. This is where my environmental sensibilities took root.When I learned about the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental studies program, I felt it might be &ldquo;just right.&rdquo;I worked at an environmental consulting firm during graduate school, and have been working on environmental and energy issues ever since.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What is a day in the life like in your current position?<br />
A.</strong> A lot of reading, research, data analysis, and writing, all of which I really enjoy and feel privileged to be able to do on a daily basis. With a focus on applied research, I get the opportunity to talk to and learn from industry and academic leaders, as well as regulators and policy makers. Being on campus and surrounded by such smart people all of the time is inspiring, and humbling. It is also exciting to be around so many young, brilliant kids who are so socially aware. I just wish they weren&rsquo;t a constant reminder of my advancing age.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What motivates you to keep going?<br />
A. </strong>My daughter, my extremely supportive husband, and close-knit family.I&rsquo;m luckier than I deserve. I try to give back in honor of my good fortune.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Who inspires you in terms of female leaders?<br />
A. </strong>Women like Katie McGinty (who hired me out of graduate school), Cheryl LaFleur (commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), and Gina McCarthy (former EPA Administrator) are impressive not only because they have accomplished so much in their careers, but also because they are fierce, wicked-smart, full of personality, and are moms to boot.My co-workers who have multiple children are also sources of inspiration, because I see them every day working magic at home and in the office. I never considered myself a feminist until I had my daughter.Now, as a mom, I&rsquo;m convinced that women are super-heroes&hellip;and we are here to change the world.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What role do you think women specifically can play in environmental efforts today?<br />
A. </strong>I will shamelessly promote an essay entitled &ldquo;Arrival of the Fittest&rdquo; that I wrote for the book, &ldquo;51%: Women and the Future of Politics&rdquo; by Terri Spahr Nelson.The essay theorizes that through biology, women may be instinctually predisposed to better handle the political challenges facing our nation and globe in the future, as populations swell, competition for scarce resources intensifies, and environmental degradation increases. In so far as one believes that cooperation, not competition, will guide our species towards long-term self-sustainability, then the skills of the gatherer/nurturer may become more valuable compared to those of the hunter.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What are the biggest challenges you face?<br />
A. </strong>Keeping everything together on a day-to-day basis. Being a working mom is much harder than I thought, but also more rewarding than I could have expected. There are so many implicit demands on a woman&rsquo;s time, but I feel lucky it is this way.I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what it was like for women just a few generations ago, when home was the only frontier.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What does the future of conservation in PA look like, in your opinion?<br />
A.</strong> In the area of energy, Pennsylvania has, is, and will continue to be a national leader. The short-term challenges will be balance and transition. Continuing to improve environmental outcomes of energy production, distribution, and use, while making sure quality of life improves for residents. This must mean pursuing economic growth and development, in an affordable manner, and in a way that is consistent with our social values. These values not only include environmental stewardship, but must also assist those displaced as our energy systems evolve. Polarized positions&mdash;like &ldquo;renewables only,&rdquo; or &ldquo;drill-baby-drill&rdquo;&mdash;are easy because they provide a feeling of ideological comfort.And, in some states these positions may work. But, in Pennsylvania, progress will come from the universally uncomfortable reality of compromise.</p>

Katie McGinty: A Lifetime of Environmental Policymaking & Leadership,3/28/2018,"<p><strong>By Katie McGinty</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>PennFuture is honoring Katie McGinty with a lifetime achievement award at the <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">Fourth Annual Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards</a> for her work as a former state and federal environmental policy official, as she served as an environmental advisor to Vice President Al Gore and President Bill Clinton, and for her work as Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in the Cabinet of Governor Ed Rendell, among many other environmental policy leadership accomplishments.</em></strong></p>

<p>I have felt privileged to work throughout my career on protecting the environment. The reasons are obvious as well as more subtle: at an elemental level, nothing is more essential than air, land and water. So, there is no question that a career dedicated to the environment has purpose.</p>

<p>Less straightforward, but even more compelling to me, is that the environment is and can be a common ground for humanity in a world rife with battle grounds.</p>

<p>Now, sometimes the environment can invite fighting words. We are all too familiar with the tired thinking that, &quot;It is jobs&lrm; or the environment; the environment or the economy.&quot;</p>

<p>But Ive seen action on the environment heal wounds, too. Neighbors banding together to clean their watershed, even when they otherwise have little in common; logging communities moving away from mowing forests down and adopting sustainable forest management to preserve timber jobs for the long haul, and to unleash local creativity to diversify the economy. I have seen coal towns recognize that making renewable energy equipment creates good jobs, while also helping to tackle climate change.</p>

<p><strong>Here is the key:</strong>using environmental problems not as a wedge, but as the glue to pull people together in joint purpose.</p>

<p>And we need that so very much now. I believe we face an existential moment in this still young democracy. We seem rapidly to be devolving into endlessly warring factions. Facts dont seem to matter and respect for a different point of view is in dangerously short supply. Tribalism is kryptonite to self-governance and representative democracy. Yet, attachment to our own narrow self-interests is trumping commitment to truth, to rule of law, to any attachment to transcendent ideas and ideals.</p>

<p>Calling forward our commitment to that special river, park, or to a climate that nurtures and sustains life can be a mighty force against the forces otherwise ripping and tearing us apart. Never has it been more urgent that we redouble our dedication to environmental protection as an inspiring mission, as something that binds and calls forth the &quot;better angels of our nature.&quot;</p>

<p>It is my honor to be recognized by PennFuture, an extraordinary organization that was always my &quot;go to&quot; partner in reaching far and high to protect the environment. With many joint efforts to celebrate, what a joy to know: we are just getting started!</p>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>Where did you grow up?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>As a child, I split my time between my parents, spending summers living in Detroit, Michigan, and the school year in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I have spent my adulthood living and working in Philadelphia.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>Can you describe your educational background?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>I hold a B.A. in political science from the University of Pennsylvania and I am working toward completing my masters in environmental studies, also at the University of Pennsylvania.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What first inspired you to work in conservation?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>When I graduated with my undergrad degree, it was a toss up between working for a publishing company or an environmental group. I went to work for Natural Resources Defense Council as a research assistant in their Water and Oceans Department, and the rest is history. Growing up in cities with heavy industry along river ways, the rivers were often seen simply as dividing points from one part of the city to another in Philadelphia, or as a flowing borderline from one country to another in Detroit. It fascinated me to learn that life was as busy below the surface of these metropolitan rivers as it was above, and that they were both affecting one another in some visible but often invisible ways. I would have to say that&rsquo;s where my journey to understand the complicated relationship between humans and water began, and the curiosity and desire for a mutualistic relationship between the two has continued to drive my work.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What is a day in the life like in your current position?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>It changes daily. During the winter, I am mostly teaching science once a week at Jubilee School, curriculum planning for boating season, or developing concepts for new bodies of artwork. Spring and summer are go-time for me! I am on the river most of the time, giving history and ecology tours at Bartram&rsquo;s and Glen Foerd. I also take high school students to perform scientific monitoring of the Schuylkill River, read and write about my reflections on space and society, or just nerd out with some sci-fi to unwind.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What motivates you to keep going?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>The youth I work with each day. Someone before me worked really hard and overcame challenges and busted down barriers so that I can do the work I am passionate about today. My hope is to make the path a little wider for the next generation.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>Who inspires you in terms of female leaders?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>They may seem a bit unconventional as inspiring female leaders but I would have to say Storm from the X-Men and Octavia Butler. Storm is a fictional mutant super hero from Marvel who has the ability to control the weather. In her early years and eagerness to provide the village she was living in with relief from a drought, she brought on rain, and unfortunately the incident threw off the natural course of nature and wreaked havoc elsewhere resulting in lives lost. She lamented what she had done and learned to be more careful and thoughtful with her powers. For me, this stands out as an anecdotal reminder that good intentions are not always synonymous with what is right or even helpful. Careful thought and the absence of ego are important in making a difference for the better.Octavia Butler is a brilliant Sci-Fi author. She has a unique way of weaving science, social justice and storytelling together that is compelling and innovative. Her books still hold relevance today. I have always enjoyed using science-fiction or narrative in my teaching and art practice. In my mind, she is the standard for how to do it.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What role do you think women specifically can play in environmental efforts today?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>According to statistics, women make up around half of the world&rsquo;s population. The majority of studies are based on sex and not gender, so the numbers are subject to being flawed on the actual specifics. To this day, women are underrepresented in the sciences and politics. There is a significant loss of insight and perspective that is needed for scientific interpretation, policymaking, and advocacy, stunting growth and innovation.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What are the biggest challenges you face?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>The biggest challenge in my work at the moment is a lack of STEM and STEAM programs in schools due to scarce resources. There are more youth interested in the programs I work with than can be accommodated, which is a tragedy. There are youth in their formative years interested in science and they can&rsquo;t explore those inklings or sparks of curiosity that could potentially lead to job security, a diverse field of experts, and a better future for everyone, simply because the funding isn&rsquo;t being allocated to the right places. Another challenge I often face is that of representation. I am often one of very few people of color in the room when attending environmental conferences. Though in recent years, environmental justice has become a main focus for larger organizations, and communities of color have been a focal point, there is still a lack of actual representation from these communities in discussion, planning or decision-making.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What does the future of conservation in PA look like, in your opinion?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>If we can improve school funding and get STEM and STEAM programs into the schools, bring communities of color into the planning process as we create policy and develop cities, and acknowledge our history, even when it is problematic, by promoting more truthful narratives of the past, I think we have a chance. We are in a place at the moment where I believe if we plan carefully, PA has the ability to become a leader and model, specifically for water conservation efforts and for large cities moving toward renewable energy.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q. Where did you grow up?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> I grew up in Massachusetts, in a suburb of Boston. The most memorable part of my childhood home was the undeveloped hill behind our small ranch house. My twin sister and I had many adventures &ndash; big and small &ndash; on that hill.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> Can you describe your e</span>ducation background?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> I did my undergraduate work at Antioch College in Ohio. It was a very progressive curriculum with no grades and rotations between on-campus academic quarters and off-campus quarters, where your education was a cooperative work experience.I really got to tailor my education and travel all over the North American continent. After college, I worked as a veterinary technician for a year before attending a graduate program in ecology at SUNY Syracuse. For my graduate research, I studied birds on an uninhabited island in Alaska for a year and a half with another graduate student &ndash; who, by the way, is now my husband of 18 years!</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q. What first inspired you to work in conservation?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> I always felt a connection with nature growing up and I recognized at an early age that my life would be far less rich and meaningful if I was not able to connect with nature. What would life be like if I could not tune out of the stress and bustle of the &ldquo;daily grind&rdquo; and tune in to the joyful, life affirming beauty of a wren singing his heart out at dawn?I personally find strength in frequent reminders that the world is a much bigger and richer place than the small sphere of my daily experience. Encountering a deer in the woods or witnessing a hawk on the wing going about their business helps keep my perspective in check.</div>

<div></div>

<div>I started out my career thinking I wanted to be a wildlife biologist but ultimately, I came to the belief that the most fundamental thing that needs to be in place before conservation and environmental sustainability can happen is that people need to value nature.If nature is not personally meaningful or relevant to the vast majority of people, then there will not be enough will or drive or interest in doing the hard work and making the difficult choices we face in protecting it.The good news is that nature really has something of value to offer everyone. That is the truly remarkable thing about the natural world in all its dynamic complexity and stability &ndash; nature has a knack for meeting you where you are and giving you what you need, if you&rsquo;ll let it.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q. What is a day in the life like in your current position?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong>My days are incredibly varied, although there are a couple constants.The first is that I spend a lot of time talking and engaging with people, whether it be my staff, our board of directors, residents, community partners, donors&hellip;you name it.The second is that I try to have lunch with my staff every day.We all break for a big communal lunch where we get to talk, eat and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. This brings me such joy and is a big part of setting the tone for the kind of culture I want at the office. </div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q. What motivates you to keep going?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> I have been incredibly fortunate to work with some really top-notch, smart and talented people and they are what motivate me every day.I have learned so much from my teams at the Schuylkill Center and at the Wissahickon Valley Watershed Association and it is my interactions and relationships with them that fuels me and keeps me going. They really are remarkable people who are passionate about making the world a better place.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q. Who inspires you in terms of female leaders?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> Marilyn Nyman is an incredibly successful entrepreneur, leader, and woman whom I admire.She inspires me to grow and challenge myself and she is a model for the kind of leader I want to be.Whenever I spend time with her, she gives me something interesting to think about, chew on, and try out.I am incredibly grateful for that.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q. What role do you think women specifically can play in environmental efforts today?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> I think women can define a new leadership model for executives and organizational leaders, one that focuses on building community, collaboration and empathy.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q. What are the biggest challenges you face?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A. </strong>The environmental field is low-ranking in terms of our culture&rsquo;s priorities.It seems we have very little influence politically and socially compared to business, health and education, for example.In my role as Director of Education at the Schuylkill Center, I could see this play out in how parents tended to prioritize the experiences and opportunities they are providing their children.I spent a lot of time educating parents that giving their children unstructured opportunities to play outdoors arereally important to their growth and development.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Q. What does the future of conservation in PA look like, in your opinion?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A. </strong>Fewer organizational silos, more within-sector and cross-sector collaborations.I think cross-sector collaborations are essential to increasing our cultural influence.</div>

<div>If we want to grow a larger constituency of people who value nature, than we need to start the &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; or approach with an emphasis on other people&rsquo;s values, rather than on our environmental values. It&rsquo;s about connecting with what motivates the people you are trying to reach. That&rsquo;s the starting point. We need to find more of those places where our values intersect with broader, cultural values.</div>

Fighting for Environmental Justice,3/27/2018,"<p><em><strong>By: Hon. Donna Bullock</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>PennFuture is honoring Bullock, PA House of Representatives, Philadelphia County, as the Woman of Environmental Justice for her work in representing and protecting citizens disproportionately affected by pollution and environmental impacts, and for her support of expanding green jobs. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">She will be given this award at the Fourth Annual Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards on April 19.</a></strong></em></p>

<p>My name is State Representative Donna Bullock, and I represent the 195th Legislative District, which includes parts of North and West Philadelphia. I am honored to be included among the women being recognized as one of PennFuture&rsquo;s 2018 Women in Conservation.</p>

<p>Prior to being an elected official, I had very little engagement in environmental issues.Like many parents, I wanted my children to live healthy lives, breathe fresh air, and drink clean water, but I didn&rsquo;t know about the hidden toxins that were present in our homes, our relatives homes, their schools and daycare centers, and even the local playgrounds.</p>

<p>Then, I read a report about lead poisoning in Philadelphia, and specifically about my neighborhood of Strawberry Mansion, where 21 percentof the children tested had lead poisoning.And I thought about my own son, who was previously tested to have lead in his blood. All at once, I was relieved and infuriated.Relieved to know that it wasn&rsquo;t my fault that he was exposed to lead (lead is so ever-present in Philadelphia, that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to escape it), but also angry to know that so many children in my neighborhood were impacted.</p>

<p>And then I thought about the rooms where environmental policy is being discussed and how much these rooms lacked diversity, how the voices of communities like Strawberry Mansion are not at the table.But let&rsquo;s be clear, even if we aren&rsquo;t always at the policy table, we care about the environment and how it impacts our public health, our access to affordable, renewable energy, our access to affordable, sustainable food, and our inclusion in the green economy.</p>

<p>When it comes to confronting the challenges of pollution and climate change, cities and communities of color are often on the front lines.In addition to high levels of lead poisoning, our children also have high rates of asthma.We often live near, and have been exposed to air and water pollution frompower plants, factories, and incinerators. Our communities are also less likely to recover from climate-caused disasters.Consider the disparity in our government&rsquo;s response during the recovery efforts of Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Maria.</p>

<p>This is why communities of color overwhelmingly supportmeasures to protect the environment.According to a poll conducted by the National Resources Defense Council, two-thirds of African-Americans viewed global warming as a serious problem, and 83 percent supported the Clean Power Plan&rsquo;s proposed limits on carbon production from coal and gas fired power plants. The poll also found that most African-Americans think that the reduction of carbon pollution will create moreand healthierjobs in renewable, wind and solar energy.According to a similar survey conducted by the Sierra Club and GreenLatinos, 89 percentof the Latinos surveyed reported that the environment and pollution impact their family&rsquo;s quality of life, and 82 percentwould prefer that the U.S. invest more in clean, renewable energy sources over fossil fuels.</p>

<p>As a legislator, I use my position to create spaces for communities that are disproportionately impacted by bad environment and energy decisions to have a voice, and to have a seat at the policy table.I have hosted community mixers and panel discussions with diverse stakeholders, and I hope to use the information sessions to inform and shape policy in Harrisburg - policy that would protect families like mine in Strawberry Mansion, and many others throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

A Lifetime of Leadership in Energy Efficiency Advocacy: Women in Conservation,3/27/2018,"<p><em><strong>By: Liz Robinson</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Liz is being presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">PennFuture&rsquo;s Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards</a> event for her work as founder and former executive director of the Energy Coordinating Agency, where she served for 33 years; for her work as the co-founder and first director of the Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance, and for her current accomplishments as executive director of the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association.</strong></em></p>

<p>I began my career as a teacher, in both public and private schools, but moved quickly to community organizing and human services, landing in homeless services.After three years as the director of a homeless shelter, I realized that I&rsquo;d much rather be preventing problems than band-aiding them.I also realized that energy costs were one of the few basic needs that low income residents could actually control.My love of nature and commitment to preserving the environment led me to low income energy services.</p>

<p>Philadelphia in the early 1980&rsquo;s was in the throes of a full blown energy and poverty crisis.Philadelphia Gas Works went from shutting off 3,000 customers a year to shutting off 30,000 for nonpayment in one year.Entire blocks were left without power.Unfortunately, PGW considered these customers &ldquo;deadbeats&rdquo; and refused to meet with the advocates defending them.I went to the mayor and to the religious leadership and asked them to broker a dialogue with PGW.We formed an Energy/Poverty Task Force, and undertook a yearlong research effort to analyze Philadelphia&rsquo;s low income energy problem for the first time. The task force then convened a broad range of public/private stakeholders to develop comprehensive, lasting solutions.</p>

<p>Thus, the Energy Coordinating Agency was established in 1984 to coordinate all low income energy services, streamline access, build capacity, and develop systems to insure high quality and accountability.The delivery system had to be grassroots, so we created the citywide network of Neighborhood Energy Centers, a system which has since been replicated in Delaware. The cornerstone of the system was and remains energy conservation and efficiency, accompanied by strong self-help energy education to enable low income households to reduce their usage to affordable levels. I was hired as ECA&rsquo;s first executive director and remained in the role until August of 2017.</p>

<p>In the mid 1990&rsquo;s, the restructuring of the utility industry created many opportunities for clean energy.Together with advocates statewide, I worked to put in place the policy frameworks for both the energy efficiency and solar industries in the Keystone state.I contributed to a number of key accomplishments, including the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, the first net metering tariff, the first training for solar photovoltaic professionals, the first clean energy education campaign, and Act 129. In this process, I worked very closely with a small group of advocates to establish the Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance (KEEA) and its sister organization, the KEEA Energy Education Fund (KEEF).KEEA is the trade association for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s energy efficiency industry.</p>

<p>One of ECA&rsquo;s great contributions has consistently been to use its nimbleness as a nonprofit to convene the stakeholders, and create the structures and institutions that are needed to advance the clean energy industry in Pennsylvania.ECA also managed the Energy Cooperative Association of Philadelphia, transforming it from a city-based oil coop into a statewide renewable energy cooperative, growing ECAP overnight from 700 to 7000 members.</p>

<p>ECA is now focused on developing the highly skilled and diverse workforce of local men and women so desperately needed to fill jobs in the rapidly growing energy efficiency and solar energy industries.</p>

<p>I am now consulting with a few organizations, one of which is the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association.PSEA is a fabulous local group which has been sponsoring the Junior Solar Sprint for 25 years.Through the Junior Solar Sprint, 5th through 8th graders design, build and race model solar cars, and have a great deal of fun in the process! Come join us for this amazing event on Saturday, May 19th at 9 am on the Drexel Campus at 31st and Market Streets.</p>

<p>Philadelphia has finally begun to make strides toward its goal of becoming a sustainable city, but the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is lagging behind again. State legislators need to understand that their goals of economic prosperity and good-paying jobs for Pennsylvanians can most rapidly be met by investing in energy efficiency and solar. These are the cleanest energy resources, energy efficiency is the cheapest, and solar is now competitive with conventional supplies, both are found in abundance statewide, and they create more jobs than any other energy resources.With climate change well underway, none of us has a moment to lose.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for this award.It is truly an honor.</p>

Protecting the Delaware River: Women in Conservation,3/27/2018,"<p><em><strong>By: Jaclyn Rhoads</strong></em></p>

<p><strong><em>Jaclyn is being honored at <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">PennFutures Fourth Annual Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards</a>for her work in the Delaware River Watershed through leadership roles with Darby Creek Valley Association, Friends of the Heinz Refuge, and for her work as assistant executive director of Pinelands Preservation Alliance.</em></strong></p>

<p>My name is Jaclyn Rhoads.I wear many hats in the environmental community. If I am on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River, I am the assistant executive director of Pinelands Preservation Alliance, a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization dedicated to the protection of the Pinelands National Reserve.In Pennsylvania, where I live, I serve as president of the Friends of the Heinz Refuge and the Darby Creek Valley Association, two awesome nonprofits that have functioned for more than 20 years with all volunteers.I became involved in conservation when I started college in my hometown of Philadelphia.My family didn&rsquo;t travel much, yet I was fascinated with the natural environment. My father was and continues to bug everyone about conserving energy and water, since he was born during the depression.I believe this somehow directed me towards environmental advocacy.</p>

<p>Every day, I work on a variety of environmental issues from climate change to green stormwater infrastructure, but most of my work centers around our water resources.The Delaware River watershed doesn&rsquo;t share the same glamour or federal resources like the Chesapeake Bay or Great Lakes, but it is a unique and essential resource to the residential and ecological communities it serves.A combination of preservation of lands, restoration of poor stormwater infrastructure, education of the general public, and strong policies can return this great river to a source of fishing and recreation, even in the most stressed reaches, which is a big focus for all of the organizations that I am involved with.</p>

<p>Although the restoration of the Delaware River is very important to me, I am most concerned about society&rsquo;s lack of environmental ethics.I hope that my work to get people involved in protecting our natural resources will help to establish the connection between our built environment and the natural environment, which is missing.I strive in all that I do to remind people why it is important that we address climate change, that we build rain gardens, that we have strong policies for stopping pollution, and that we just care about what has been created for us.</p>

<p>I love the work that I do, and I am thankful to those who want to recognize my efforts, but my greatest reward is being supported by dozens of environmental advocates where I work and volunteer.This award is a symbol of all the great work that so many people do daily, and my hope for the future is that the number of individuals who volunteer, donate, and educate the next generation about environmental conservation will significantly grow, and that the next generation of political leaders puts the environment high on its priority list.</p>

<p>We need people, and I don&rsquo;t just mean individuals wanting to get paid to do this work, but people who want to give up their free time and invest in the future.</p>

A Lifetime of Land Protection: Women in Conservation,3/27/2018,"<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/dulcie%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 889px;"" /></p>

<p><em><strong>By: Dulcie F. Flaharty</strong></em></p>

<p><strong><em>Dulcie recently retired from Natural Lands, where she served as Vice President of Community Partnerships in Southeast Pa. She has worked in land conservation for years and previously served as executive director of Montgomery County Lands Trust. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">She will be honored with a Woman of Lifetime Achievement Award on April 19 in Philadelphia, at PennFutures Fourth Annual Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards.</a></em></strong></p>

<p>I have yet to meet a baby conservationist. We are not born with a game plan to identify, protect, and enhance Mother Nature&rsquo;s loveliest and most critical places. At differing times, for varied reasons, this work, this passion gets buried in our hearts, harnesses our intellect and our dreams, intertwines our vocations and avocations.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, any strategic plan I may have had for my life was written in pencil&hellip;and I always carry an eraser.</p>

<p>Accepting a Lifetime Achievement Award from PennFuture found its way on to my menu of gratifying experiences. It is an unexpected and much appreciated gift from the conservation community that it is a privilege to work among. They are skilled and tireless professionals. We met as colleagues, bonded as partners and celebrated successes and dealt with setbacks as loyal friends.</p>

<p>Having recently retired from Natural Lands, after 20 years as the founding executive of Montgomery County Lands Trust, I have had a chance to consider how a woman trained as an art historian found a career in land conservation and community connections.</p>

<p>Born in Philadelphia, I chose to attend Northwestern University, to taste a bit of the Midwest and foster an interest in architecture and painting through a curriculum in Art History. I returned to the area and received my degree at Temple University.</p>

<p>Land preservation found me 25years ago, when a bold group of Montgomery County leaders determined that they could emulate the Chester County open space efforts.Together, they approached county commissioners with a finely crafted program to save land in the county, requesting a $100 million budget over ten years.</p>

<p>Wise leaders determined that a big budget alone would not assure success; a grassroots, on the ground organization had to be created to work with decision makers. The goal was to help foster smart choices, to determine where to make preservation investment, and how to arrange the inevitable growth coming to our region.</p>

<p>I was given the chance in 1993 to help build a county nonprofit land trust, Montgomery County Lands Trust, to work hand and glove with the county to insure that the Open Space Program reached all municipalities. Bringing land protection organizations, watershed groups and local conservation supporters into a collaborating assemblage was a goal.</p>

<p>We prioritized community-centric, policy-supported projects. If the policy wasn&rsquo;t there, we worked with elected officials to develop it. Earning trust and gaining respect from decision makers and private citizens was a hallmark of our efforts. Strong relationships developed with state and local elected leaders who recognized that our projects were bipartisan and added value to their communities. Traditional metrics for success piled up.</p>

<p>Over the next 25 years, with the invaluable help of land trust leaders, supportive county and local elected officials, generous state funding entities and a remarkablydiverse group of citizens, thousands of acres of natural resource land was protected, miles of trails were built throughout the regions, and agriculturally productive land was safeguarded for generations to come.Working in 2003 with established partnership groups and cultivated community leaders, we spearheaded a $150 million ballot campaign which received voter approval at 78 percent.A municipal education program, Green Futures, was designed to help educate and inform over 1,700 local leaders regarding smart growth and conservation decision making.</p>

<p>Yes, there were acres saved and the dollars raised&hellip;.but it was the authentic, heartwarming stories of the open space heroes who worked on projects in their communities and the families who permanently protected their family lands that powered our work.</p>

<p>My commitment to conservation efforts comes from a strong desire to communicate and connect with people around a unifying concept.Rallying diverse communities and interest groups, I remain confident that people find a deep connection and affection for the places in which they live. Those places look and feel different, but harnessing that common affection brings power and focus to collaboration. Hearing the needs and respecting the unique skills and perspectives of those we strive to motivate and guide remains an imperative component to healthy, productive partnerships.</p>

<p>Looking into the future for opportunities, I believe that the landscapes of our work may change, yet the purpose of our efforts remains constant: green, healthy, connected communities to benefit and be enjoyed by all our citizens. Combining energies with people to identify, protect and enhance those special places in every town and countryside remains a great privilege and ongoing joy.</p>

<p>We must never forget to infuse our work with joy and with heart. And together, we bring Mother Nature the field operation that will protect our most special places.</p>

The Importance of Women Leading the Way in Southeast PA,3/27/2018,"<p><strong>We are excited to share our <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/blog"">latest blogs with you</a>as we highlight the contributions of Pennsylvania women working on behalf of our environment.</strong>We are at a critical time when big decisions are being made that will influence the trajectory of our climate future, and what pathways to clean air, water and clean energy will look like going forward.<strong>As we approach Thursday, April 19, the evening in Philadelphia when PennFuture will honor these women and their work at our <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">Celebrating Women in ConservationAwards</a>, I am reminded that never before have we needed the voices of these women, and of all the others we know are out there doing good work.</strong> We thank and honor all of them and hope to see some of you in Philly at the event.</p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/blog""><strong>In our latest series of blogs, our honorees are sharing their stories.</strong></a> This year&rsquo;s honorees all come from southeast Pennsylvania, but their experiences are vastly different, spanning work with the White House to the neighbor&rsquo;s house. But a commonality among them is their passion for the work, commitment to enlisting others into advocacy at this important time, and their dedication to their communities.</p>

<p>I think of the road I have traveled since becoming involved in environmental work in 1983 as a Sierra Club volunteer where I was able to build a large coalition of hunters, anglers, recreationists, scientists and others who collectively stopped the damming of a high quality cold water fishery in northeast Pennsylvania called Nescopeck Creek. It was a fight that lasted 15 years, and I continued the work during my time at National Wildlife Federation. I was lucky to find the Sierra Club and luckier to find work in a profession that called to me.</p>

<p><strong>As PennFuture&rsquo;s sixth president and CEO, I&rsquo;m the third woman to hold that position in the organization, following in the footsteps of founding president and CEO John Hanger, who was followed by George Jugovic, Jan Jarrett, Cindy Dunn and Larry Schweiger.</strong> PennFuture has had four board chairs over our roughly 20 year history, beginning with founding board chair R. John Dawes, Jr., followed by Joy Kauffman, David Lane and now Char Magaro. So, the organization has had a gender balance of leadership on both the staff and volunteer leadership side, with many, many other talented and committed individuals as part of our organization now, or who were in the past.</p>

<p>I am sure that all of our honorees had the help of a great many people as part of their stories &ndash; families, mentors, teachers, partner organizations who ascribed value to these individuals. I am sure all found inspiration, perhaps from nature herself, or motivation from their children&rsquo;s or communities&rsquo; health that compelled action.</p>

<p>Not everyone&rsquo;s story will look the same but we all have a part to play.For some, making a meaningful life will be a solitary and quiet endeavor, and a pat on the back will never be felt, or expected.It feels important to keep this in mind as today&rsquo;s world calls on all of us to do more for the people and places we care about. </p>

Clean Water and Responsible Development are a Natural in the Poconos,3/20/2018,"<p><em><strong>This opinion piece was published in the March 18, 2018 edition of the Pocono Record.</strong></em></p>

<p>The streams, forests and mountains of the Poconos are nothing short of legendary, and these natural jewels have enabled businesses and tourism to flourish for decades.</p>

<p>This is why - as the state&rsquo;s watchdog for clean air, pure water, and a healthy climate - PennFuture finds it important to respond to the Feb. 16 full-page ad in the Pocono Record, that decries, rather than celebrates, the state&rsquo;s recognition that area streams have exceptional water quality.</p>

<p>It is easy for citizens to be fooled by the false choice between economic development and a clean environment. It&rsquo;s a trap that polarizes communities into endless disagreements when, in fact, the history of this very region demonstrates that a clean environment, properly respected, promotes economic development.</p>

<p>The history of the Poconos is a history of residents that have viewed nature as an integral part of our community, to be used with love and respect, rather than as a commodity to be consumed with no effect on our community. Our foresight in protecting and respecting the environment is what has enabled businesses to draw millions of dollars to the local economy. Visitors come to ski in our mountains, fish in our streams, camp in our parks and walk on our trails. These visitors support local business because of the natural environment, not in spite of it.Famed conservationist Aldo Leopold referred to this view of nature as the land ethic, a philosophy that simply recognizes the interdependence between people and nature &ndash; that we, the land and men and women, are part of the same community.</p>

<p>The Poconos has served as a peaceful escape for everything that nature offers: places for quiet contemplation, vigorous hiking, thrilling hunting, and other activities that allow families to laugh, explore and play. Water slides, zip lines and ski slopes have flourished because of the surrounding natural environment. There is no need to choose between conservation of the environment and growth of our economy: we can have both.For that reason, our community should continue to celebrate protection of our streams, and firmly reject the notion that our community should be developed separately and apart from protection of our environment.We need both.</p>

<p>Through our Poconos office and staff, PennFuture looks forward to working with local business owners to build relationships and shared goals that will contribute to the natural beauty of our area, and successful, responsible development in the Poconos.</p>

Join Tonight’s Lehigh Valley Watershed Listening Session,3/12/2018,"<p>Tonight, PennFuture is holding the second of three watershed listening sessions in the Delaware River Basin at Fegley&rsquo;s Brew Works in Bethlehem from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.In October 2017, the first listening session was held in the Poconos, and the final session will be held in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>We will start off the night with introductions from the PennFuture staff and acknowledgement of our new office, located in Mt. Pocono. This office services Northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Delaware River Basin. Our discussion and presentations will be led by PennFuture&rsquo;s Northeast PA staff, including our Staff Attorney Abby Jones, and myself, as I serve as PennFuture&rsquo;s Northeast PA Outreach Coordinator. Watershed groups, other environmental organizations, and volunteers will also have the chance to meet members of PennFuture&rsquo;s Philadelphia staff, including Director of Outreach Jay Andrews, Ph.D., Southeast PA Outreach Coordinator Alex Cupo, and Staff Attorney Alice Baker.</p>

<p>After introductions, a short presentation about how PennFuture can help local environmental groups and watershed organizations in the areas with outreach, policy, and legal work will occur, and then we will open the floor to attendees for input on how we can partner in the Lehigh Valley community. Attendees at this session will focus on groups placed in the counties of Lehigh, Northampton, Carbon, Schuylkill, Berks, and southern Monroe.</p>

<p>Our goal for the Lehigh Valley watershed listening session is to learn more about different environmental organizations efforts, trials, and triumphs to address critical environmental and water quality issues in the region. PennFuture is proud to work with new partners and we look forward to contributing our expertise to the Lehigh Valley, as well as across the state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Come, mingle, and tell us what you think. Please contact me with any questions at 570-216-3344 or at rinaldi@pennfuture.org.</p>

<p><em>Tonight&rsquo;s Lehigh Valley listening session will be held at Fegley&rsquo;s Brew Works&rsquo; downstairs lounge in Bethlehem from 5 to 7 p.m. The address is 559 Main Street #101, Bethlehem, PA 18018.</em></p>

New Permit Better Controls Pollution from Stormwater Runoff,3/12/2018,"<p>It may be hard to believe, but stormwater, rain and snow melt running off of pavements that are covered by impenetrable materials such as asphalt, concrete, brick, stone&mdash;and rooftops, aresignificant causes of water pollution.</p>

<p>As the stormwater runs over these impervious surfaces, it collects pollutants, including oil, pesticides, sediment, and bacteria. Untreated stormwater runoff entering our streams can result in the contamination of our drinking water supplies; prohibitions on swimming, fishing or boating uses; injury or death to aquatic plants and animals; dangers to public health; and increased flooding.</p>

<p>In many places, this stormwater runoff is conveyed through distinct sewer pipes that bypass the wastewater treatment plants and discharge the polluted runoff directly into our streams and lakes. This system is known as a &ldquo;municipal separate storm sewer system&rdquo; or MS4.</p>

<p>Luckily, there are laws that protect our waters from polluted stormwater runoff. For example, stormwater from MS4 in urbanized areas is controlled through a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit under the federal Clean Water Act.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) implements this program and issues permits allowing the discharge as long as the permittee complies with the permit requirements. PADEP issued its first general permit for MS4s in 2003. Although each permit is only supposed to be effective for five years, the PADEP&rsquo;s second MS4 general permit did not become effective until 2013.</p>

<p>Even then, after more than 10 years of the program&rsquo;s implementation, this second MS4 permit was woefully insufficient.<strong>PennFuture took issue with the inadequacy of the PADEP&rsquo;s MS4 program and filed an appeal of PADEP&rsquo;s approval of coverage under the MS4 general permit for Upper Gwynedd Township.</strong> (PA Environmental Hearing Board Docket No. 2013-105-L). <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/cases"">You can read more about PennFuture&rsquo;s claims here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>After more than a year of negotiations, PennFuture and PADEP entered into a settlement which addressed PennFuture&rsquo;s most important objections, including providing an opportunity for public participation and requiring a demonstration that determined pollution reductions would occur. As a result of PennFuture&rsquo;s challenge, the subsequent permit is much more protective of our waters. This new, more protective permit goes into effect this Friday, March 16.</strong></p>

<p>The new permit includes the six minimum controls of public education and outreach on stormwater, public involvement and participation, illicit discharge detection and elimination, construction site stormwater runoff control, post-construction stormwater management, pollution prevention and good housekeeping of municipal operations.</p>

<p>The PADEP 2018 general permit also requires MS4 permittees discharging into waters impaired as a result of sediment and nutrient pollution to include a plan on how to achieve reductions in these pollutants over the five year term of the permit. Implementation of these plans to reduce pollutants will advance Pennsylvania&rsquo;s efforts to reach pollutant reduction targets in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, PADEP has reviewed these plans for sufficiency and compliance with the permit requirements. We have high hopes that the 2018 permit will help protect and improve Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waters and look forward to working with PADEP and municipalities alike to ensure the permit is appropriately implemented.</p>

“4TheDelaware” Campaign Asks Governors to Step Up for the Delaware River Watershed,3/7/2018,"<p>Pennsylvania is among four states that include portions of the Delaware River Basin, along with New Jersey, Delaware, and New York. In Pennsylvania, 17 of the state&rsquo;s 67 counties lie entirely or partly within the Delaware River watershed. In 2010, <a href=""http://www.docs.dcnr.pa.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_20031252.pdf"" target=""_blank"">according to the PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</a>, nearly 5 million people lived within Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion of the watershed. That number has certainly grown since.</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture, the Delaware Nature Society, Friends of the Upper Delaware, and New Jersey Audubon, are now working together with our partner, the National Wildlife Federation, to lead the 4TheDelaware Campaign, urging state leaders to advance and expand support for this critical watershed.</strong></p>

<p>The Delaware River provides drinking water to residents both within and outside of the watershed and supports local economies along its banks in cities like Philadelphia and the many towns in the region. The river also provides millions of jobs (<a href=""http://www.state.nj.us/drbc/library/documents/SocioeconomicValueDRB-UDEL-FinalRpt.pdf"" target=""_blank"">accounting for approximately $115.5 billion in wages in 2011</a>) in the state including outdoor recreation, farming, water supply and wastewater utilities, and watershed organizations. It is a resource that plays a crucial role supporting public health as well as the regional economy. By prioritizing the Delaware, leaders can prove that good jobs and a healthy environment go hand in hand.</p>

<p>We are joining together as organizations across four states to call on the governors of Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York, and New Jersey to take a stand and defend the river&rsquo;s health, protect the thriving economy that relies on the Delaware River watershed, and safeguard the animal and plant life essential to the ecological health of the region and the river.</p>

<p>Restoration programs established by environmental organizations, the Pennsylvania Game Commission, and the federal government have been successful in bringing bald eagles and <a href=""http://www.philly.com/philly/health/shad-make-strong-comeback-in-delaware-river-20171030.html"" target=""_blank"">river shad back</a> to the Delaware River, <a href=""http://www.state.nj.us/drbc/edweb/bald-eagle.html"" target=""_blank"">where they had nearly disappeared entirely</a>. This is a promising sign of restoration, but there is much more to be done to ensure regional progress. The Delaware River is home to several endangered species, and fish and wildlife rely on the watershed for habitat and food. With such precious wildlife at stake, it is especially critical for Pennsylvania to protect the diverse ecosystems that support the Delaware River.</p>

<p>Through the work of our incredible supporters, the commitment from our legislators, and the thoughtful leadership from our business partners, we can restore the Delaware River, protect the region for generations to come, and preserve it for the families and wildlife that all call this watershed home.</p>

<p>Join us as we kick off this great campaign to make the Delaware River watershed the model for a fully restored and vibrant watershed!</p>

Shop for Clean Energy & Take the Power Back,3/5/2018,"<p><img  src=""/Files/Admin/Take%2Dthe%2DPower%2DBack%2DSocial%2DMedia%2DImage%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 476px; height: 249px;"" /></p>

<p>Clean renewable energy is a growing success story. A recent report on the electric power industry from the federal <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_es1b"" target=""_blank"">Energy Information Administration</a> showed that non-hydro renewable energy grew 13.4 percent year-over-year in 2017. Of that, solar power grew at an impressive 46.9 percent. While clean energy was growing, fossil fuels were in a slump with coal generation down -2.5 percent and natural gas generation dropping -7.7 percent.</p>

<p>This trend shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. <a href=""https://www.lazard.com/media/438038/levelized-cost-of-energy-v100.pdf"" target=""_blank"">A recent study shows</a> the cost of generating solar electricity from large solar farms dropped 11 percent last year, and the cost of rooftop solar dropped 26 percent. For those of us in Pennsylvania who want to install a solar system, the drop in prices is good news. At least, it is good news if you are lucky enough to live in a location where you can buy or lease a solar system for your rooftop.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this still isn&rsquo;t an option for many Pennsylvanians. The cost of solar systems is certainly a factor, but many families lack a good location for solar power. Families who rent or live in multi-family units face particular challenges, but even those who own their own single-family homes need property that isn&rsquo;t in the shade, that has suitable wiring, and a roof that is both big enough and strong enough for the installation. As a result, maybe 50 percent or more of Pennsylvania families lack meaningful access to solar generation during the present time. Some states have &ldquo;community solar&rdquo; laws that allow customers to buy a share of a solar system and have the generation deducted from their bill, just like they would if the panels were on their roof. Unfortunately, the legislation in Pennsylvania hasn&rsquo;t progressed that far and most families also lack this as a viable option.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not surprising that Pennsylvania consumers may feel trapped into buying energy from dirty fossil fuel companies. But, there is still an option for many of us: Pennsylvania is one of the 17 states and the District of Columbia that has a retail electric choice program.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""/takethepowerback"" target=""_blank""><strong>This is why PennFuture recently launched the Take the Power Back campaign</strong></a> to help make consumers aware that they have the power of choice, and that choosing clean energy can be easy. We want to start the conversation about the benefits of switching to clean energy as an investment in our future. If you can generate your own clean energy, that is fantastic. If not, making the switch to buying clean energy is the next best choice: <a href=""/Files/Admin/TakethePowerBack_Steps-to-Take-for-Parents.pdf"" target=""_blank"">our website shows you how.</a></p>

<p>Most Pennsylvanians have a regulated utility that delivers electricity to their homes, but those utilities are basically delivery companies. They don&rsquo;t own the power plants and they are not in the business of selling electricity. <strong>If we don&rsquo;t choose to shop for power, they will do the shopping for us - but the choice is ours.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This means that if you are tired of waiting for the government to get serious about climate change, or if you are frustrated at the amount of tax breaks and other handouts that are given to the fossil fuel industry, you don&rsquo;t have to wait for someone else to act.</strong>You can make the choice to buy clean energy.

A New Role as Policy Director,2/28/2018,"<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve lived, worked, and organized in rural Pennsylvania to support organizations and causes that impact our everyday lives, including the Boy Scouts, prison reform, and clean water. Recently, I moved into a new role at PennFuture as Director of Policy. I&rsquo;m excited to continue advocating for communities around the Commonwealth that want a clean environment and strong ecology for themselves, as well as their children, friends, and family.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long desired to work in environmental and conservation policy to save the resources I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with over the years. Growing up, I spent countless hours on my family&rsquo;s farm property and became intimately familiar with the forested and mountain landscapes of Penn&rsquo;s Woods. My worldview has been indelibly shaped by memories of learning to swim in the Juniata with my father, fishing in the Conococheague, andtoday, I continue to enjoy kayaking the Yellow Breeches and backpacking the Appalachian Trail. It&rsquo;s these experiences I believe my six-year-old and two-year-old nephews should also have some day. These experiences should be available for all Pennsylvanians.</p>

<p>But, these waterways and land won&rsquo;t be preserved from degradation without organizations like PennFuture building relationships with and holding accountable state and federal legislators.</p>

<p>It is essential I keep my finger on the pulse of moving issues and that PennFuture regularly weighs in on policy matters in both Harrisburg and Washington.As PennFuture&rsquo;s chief lobbyist, I&rsquo;m on the front lines of a battle being waged to defund our parks, farmlands, trails and water, and a battle against our state agencies&rsquo; power to enforce strong laws and regulations over polluters.</p>

<p>From early on and through my professional work, I&rsquo;ve held an inner conviction to defend the powerless and advance justice wherever I can. As an advocate for our clean air, water, and climate, I&rsquo;m called to speak out. Speaking our truths to those in power helps us imagine and create the world in which we want to live. I want to live in a community where my drinking water is protected, forest land is conserved, animal species are saved, and the ability to breathe without fear of pollution is realized. My work means believing deeply in what we say and fighting for our voices to be heard in every legislative and executive office PennFuture engages. My raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre is to increase public participation in government at all levels, to advance government for the common good by increasing stakeholder engagement in all public decisions, and to look out for the people of Pennsylvania during policy debates and budget negotiations. Sometimes these positions aren&rsquo;t popular and might mean taking a risk, but, to me, that&rsquo;s what it means to stand up for something.  </p>

<p>We face formidable challenges and opportunities on the road ahead. More troubling is that we live in a rapidly changing political landscape that, at times, threatens our basic laws for the stewardship of our environment. It is important, now more than ever, that PennFuture serve as the watchdog in our statehouse, Congress, and municipalities and that we all do our best to preserve and restore our environmental protections. I&rsquo;m happy to be a part of this team and driving the policy work, day to day, for our members and all Pennsylvanians.</p>

False Choices: Why PA Doesn’t Need to Sell Out Health for Dirty Energy Jobs,2/28/2018,"<p>Since its founding 20 years ago, PennFuture has occupied a unique space in the state, from brokering the most significant policy victories advancing clean energy, to prevailing in legal cases we&rsquo;ve brought on behalf of communities and individuals fighting for their rights to clean air and pure water.</p>

<p>This element of accountability has been a common thread weaving through PennFuture&rsquo;s lifespan, and it extends to elected officials, state and federal agencies, and corporate interests whose actions stymy our work on behalf of our constituents, and our mission to protect the environment. In our view, the environment is not a special interest, it is everyone&rsquo;s interest.</p>

<p><strong>We have been compelled to extend that accountability to officials in Harrisburg and question why the environment continues to be an almost invisible issue among so many of them.</strong> To be certain, there are a handful of state legislators who lead on environmental issues, but they are outnumbered by those who are anti-environmental and anti-regulatory in their votes, actions and words.              </p>

<p>Pennsylvanians are concerned about their environment. On Jan. 30, PennFuture, the Breathe Collaborative and leading activists from Allegheny and Beaver counties held a press conference and rally in Pittsburgh to oppose the buildout of the petrochemical industry in western Pennsylvania. Afterwards, our <a href=""http://www.toxicneighbor.org"">Toxic Neighbor petitions</a>, signed by more than 3,000 Pennsylvanians opposed to Shell Appalachia&rsquo;s $6 billion ethane cracker in Beaver County, were delivered to the governor, state, federal and local legislators and Pittsburgh Regional Alliance.</p>

<p>Many of these petition recipients champion the &ldquo;petchem&rdquo; industry and its promise of jobs. While we acknowledge the opportunity that natural gas under our feet represents when it is exploited, what is the cost of that exploitation and those jobs in terms of taxpayer subsidies, risks to public health, decimation of our forests and streams, and insults to our climate?</p>

<p><strong>We seek leadership from our policymakers, particularly around creating and supporting opportunities to develop technologies, good paying jobs and our workforce around the clean energy sector.</strong>According to January 2017&rsquo;s U.S. Energy and Employment report, more than 62,000 Pennsylvanians already work in energy efficiency, and more than 7,000 work in solar and wind electric generation.<strong> Imagine the economic growth that would result from state elected officials leveling the playing field and offering similar policy support to clean energy industries that will not pollute the air your children breathe. </strong>This support is currently provided to polluting industries. We need and deserve leaders who will no longer force voters to choose between pure water to drink - or more jobs. In 2018, we can have both, and we must demand it before it is too late. If Shell is given a $1.65 billion tax break to pollute southwest Pennsylvania in exchange for jobs, why is the same investment not going into clean energy industries? Tax payers deserve better than the threat of increased asthma and cancer rates. Pennsylvania must choose to be a part of the clean energy future that many other states are pursuing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible for us to conjecture who among our elected officials will step up and lead in the arena of clean air, healthy climate and a new clean energy economy, but it is within our power to use our voices and our votes to say loud and clear that leadership among our elected officials is sorely missing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, like so much of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s long history, the modern day coal barons of the natural gas industry have captured many of the institutions that drive economic development in the state, and while it appears to be succeeding beyond all expectations, it is nowhere near finished taking advantage of the hospitable welcome it has received in the form of government subsidies, benevolent permitting and friends in government extolling its virtues and enjoying campaign contributions.</p>

<p>PennFuture and our allies are championing clean energy as a growth area for economic development and one that will not sentence our people, natural resources and climate to a future that looks poised to replicate the pollution and health impacts we&rsquo;ve experienced as a result of our fossil fueled past. We do not need to repeat history when we have better options for the future.</p>

Public Engagement is Key to Pennsylvania’s Clean Water Goals,2/21/2018,"<p>A year from this month, the final draft of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan will be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for final review, approval, and enactment. Before that happens, though, a lot of work is set to take place in the coming months. As important as this document is, and its next steps for making sure Pennsylvania meets its pollution reduction goals by 2025, none of this can happen without you.</p>

<p>Conversations during January&rsquo;s meeting of the Steering Committee for the Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) began to lay out the PennsylvaniaDepartment of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s public engagement strategy and communications around the importance of executing the important work of the WIP. To underscore this need, a new report out earlier this year reminded Pennsylvania policymakers that our Commonwealth has almost 20,000 miles of impaired streams, creeks, and rivers. Instead of focusing narrowly on the Chesapeake Bay, Pennsylvania and the WIP should focus on cleaning its local waters, which will, in sum, restore the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>Local governments, planning commissions, county commissioners, township supervisors, and state legislators, will be critical to include in these discussions and buy-in moving forward and Pennsylvania agencies should work closely with nongovernmental and nonprofit organizations working in the field to reach all of the stakeholders.</p>

<p>We recommend DEP and its Steering Committee workgroups engage the public extensively to provide needed input and feedback on the draft local planning process. Along with including public-private partnerships and innovative groups and strategies, DEP and the WIP Steering Committee should identify key stakeholders to develop action steps at the local level.</p>

<p>This year, as DEP puts its pen to paper for the Phase III WIP, it should hold a number of hearings, windows for public comments, and several opportunities for Pennsylvanians to stand up for clean water and make their voice heard for strong targets. As the state government rolls out its public engagement strategy, citizens&rsquo; participation will make all the difference.</p>

<p>You have power and you should be at the table in our states&rsquo; decisions on how to cut back our water pollution. Stay tuned for more actions and upcoming opportunities.</p>

A New Role & Policy Priorities for 2018,2/21/2018,"<div>Just about a month ago, I moved into a new role at PennFuture as the director of policy. Each day, I come to work excited to continue advocating for the clean air, pure water, and healthy climateof all Pennsylvanians. Though we live in a rapidly changing landscape, at this critical time for state and federal levels of government, it is important we serve as the watchdog over polluters and do our best to preserve and restore our environmental protections. Please allow me to introduce myself and our policy priorities for 2018.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Based in PennFuture&rsquo;s Harrisburg office, I lead and develop the organizations policy initiatives and serve asits liaison with elected officials in both Harrisburg and Washington D.C. I manage all legislative and executive branch relationships as well as public policy decisions and processes for PennFuture.As a member of the senior leadership team, I serve as PennFuture&rsquo;s chief lobbyist and external voice on policy positions, strategy, and relationships with decision makers at the local, state, and federal levels of government. I also have the pleasure of representing PennFuture on the Steering Committee of the Choose Clean Water Coalition.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Prior to serving as director of policy, I worked as PennFuture&rsquo;s Campaign Manager for Watershed Advocacy and state lead for the Choose Clean Water Coalition, where I led high-impact outreach and communications campaigns around clean water issues affecting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and communities in the Susquehanna and Potomac River basins. I focused on the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters, and provided oversight and support of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay plan and the state&rsquo;s Watershed Implementation Plan. I had the chance to work extensively on state and federal issues, including stormwater management, clean water funding, agriculture, forest retention, the Farm Bill, climate change, and water infrastructure, among others. <strong>For more information on my background, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/ezra-thrush"">click here.</a></strong></div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Our 2018 Policy Priorities</strong></div>

<div>With this background, I look forward to continuing and leading the great work of PennFuture in both the state and federal policy spheres. So much is at stake in 2018 and we&rsquo;ve developed a comprehensive suite of policy priorities for our work in Harrisburg and Washington, D.C. this year.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>For clean water, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Push for full funding for Water Commissions. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s share of funding for the Delaware River Basin Commission, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, and the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin Commission have all been cut to dangerously low levels and must be restored to protect these watersheds.</li>
	<li>Push for the creation of a dedicated clean water fund. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waters are in crisis. This fund is crucial for restoration and stewardship projects for our watersheds and we will push for the General Assembly to enact a water usage fee.</li>
	<li>Advocate for increased clean water funding for our resource agencies. We are advocating for reversing decades of program cuts to clean water programs at the Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Department of Agriculture as a part of the 2018-2019 state budget.</li>
	<li>Advocate for the passage of a package of stormwater bills (HBs 913, 914, 915, 916), which allow towns, boroughs, and other municipality types in Pennsylvania the ability to asses stormwater fees. Municipalities can use these monies for implementing critical best management practices to help them meet their clean water requirements and their pollutant reduction plans.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>For land protection, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Advocate for the passage of Growing Greener III legislation. The state&rsquo;s Growing Greener program has funded hundreds of local parks and trail projects, conserved more than 80,000 acres of threatened open space, and restored hundreds of miles of streams and waterways. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Growing Greener program has also protected thousands of acres of farmland and reclamation of abandoned mine land.</li>
	<li>Oppose any attempt to reverse Governor Wolf&rsquo;s moratorium on drilling for oil and gas in our state parks and forest lands.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>For clean air, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Push back against and oppose Shell Global&rsquo;s petrochemical build-out in Beaver County through our Toxic Neighborcampaign.</li>
	<li>Push for setting limits on methane pollution. The Governor has made it a priority to implement regulatory controls on methane pollution from oil and gas operations in 2018. We are working to advance the first part of these controls by May 2018 and begin the final process this year.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>For clean energy, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Support Commercial PACE as it builds momentum. Commercial PACE (C-PACE), which provides new financing mechanisms for municipalities wanting to support commercial buildings becoming more energy efficient, took steps forward in 2017. The bill is cosponsored by nearly two thirdsof the state Senate and is poised for passage in 2018.</li>
	<li>Advocate for the passage of the Climate Mitigation Action Act (SB 15 &ndash; Costa). This legislation instructs DEP to develop a carbon reduction program to cut emissions by 30 percentby 2030. It represents the first legislation in Pennsylvania for capping carbon emissions.</li>
	<li>Work with partners to draft and move legislation for community solar in Pennsylvania. Community solar would allow residents who can&rsquo;t install solar panels because of poor building structure or low-income to buy into a joint solar installation and still gain benefits from renewable energy.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>For a responsible State Budget and defense of our protections, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Fight the continued dismantling of DEP. The FY2017-18 state budget cut DEP&rsquo;s budget 7 percent, adding to the 40 percent already cut from DEP&rsquo;s budget during the last ten years. This hollowing out is having tangible impact, as we see fewer inspectors who can ensure water supplies are safe, fewer inspections of oil and gas activity, fewer permit reviewers, and a smaller number of scientists studying new sources of pollution. PennFuture is fighting on the frontlines in Harrisburg to stop and reverse this disturbing trend.</li>
	<li>Oppose all attempts at moving and passing the Regulatory Review bills which are currently in the House State Government Committee (HBs 209, 1237, 1792, 1959, 1960). A suite of bills crafted under the guise of &ldquo;regulatory reform&rdquo; is scheduled for a vote in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives this year that would irreparably harm our environmental agencies ability to protect our health and the environment from pollution. PennFuture is leading a coalition of organizations to defeat these bills.</li>
	<li>Oppose efforts to raid the Environmental Stewardship Fund, Keystone Recreation &amp; Parks Fund, Agriculture Preservation Fund, County Conservation District Fund, and other crucial environmental and energy funds administered by the DEP and DCNR.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Regarding federal policy initiatives, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Advocate for a strong 2018 Farm Bill. The Farm Bill represents the key opportunity to drive federal investment in agriculture, water, and land conservation programs. We are leading a coalition effort to push for increased funding across a number of key water and land programs as well as protect the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program.</li>
	<li>Protect and fund the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program (DRBRP), which was created by the Delaware River Basin Conservation Act of 2015 (DRBCA) and was a key legislative victory for PennFuture and its coalition members.</li>
	<li>Advocate for the federal RECLAIM legislation, which would invest over $50 million in new funding for land and water clean-up from legacy coal mining and acid mine drainage in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s coal country.</li>
	<li>Oppose the repeal and replacement of EPA&rsquo;s Clean Water Rule (Waters of the United States). We&rsquo;ve submitted legal and technical comments to the EPA docket to preserve the Rule which protects the drinking water of millions of Americans. PennFuture also collected hundreds of citizen letters for the EPA to stop the roll-back of this critical protection. We are continuing to fight against this move and any subsequent replacement that weakens our clean water safeguards.</li>
	<li>Be a leader in the Renewable Fuel Standard Campaign: The RFS is a federal mandate to blend renewable fuels into conventional gasoline, which had good environmental intentions initially, but ultimately led to significant carbon and land use issues. We are advancing legislation in Congress to fix the RFS and restore its initial environmental intent.</li>
</ul>

<p>With significant challenges and opportunities ahead of us this year, our team is already fast at work and eager to continue holding polluters accountable and pushing for policies and legislation that will make our environment better for all Pennsylvanians.</p>

Air Quality Expo Educates Citizens on Air Pollution,2/13/2018,"<p>PennFuture and Clean Water Action hosted the Third Annual Air Quality Expo at the Squirrel Hill Carnegie Library this month to educate East End Pittsburgh residents about the steady stream of air pollution from the Mon Valley - pointing out that this pollution travels and impacts their lives.</p>

<p>The event kicked off with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPpNlct8Lu0"" target=""_blank"">VICE media&rsquo;s documentary, &ldquo;Steam Valley,&rdquo;</a> in which PennFuture member, Cheryl Hurt, as well as other Clairton residents discuss their day-to-day routines, how they can smell benzene in the air, and how they have learned to master the technique of &ldquo;breathing while running&rdquo; in order to participate in local sports. Residents also discussed dealing with the alarming rates of childhood asthma in the area.</p>

<p>The degradation of air quality that many in the Mon Valley observe is due to one of the biggest polluters in Allegheny County, U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Clairton Coke Works. In fact, Allegheny County ranks in the top two percent nationally for cancer risk from hazardous air pollutants (<a href=""http://www.chec.pitt.edu/documents/PRETA/CHEC%20PRETA%20HAPs%20Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pittsburgh Regional Environmental Threat Analysis Report, 2013</a>).</p>

<p>The eye-opening documentary shows the disconnect between Pittsburghers who are convinced what comes out of the Clairton Coke Works is purely steam, versus what local public health and air quality experts state is actually spewed from the smokestacks, which includes particulate matter (PM 2.5).</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just Clairton residents who are at risk of these harmful plumes.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Albert Presto, an Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and a member of Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies, who is tracking the path of Mon Valley pollution, these plumes can be as far-reaching as to travel to East End communities like Squirrel Hill.</p>

<p><a href=""http://breatheproject.org/learn/breathe-mobile/"" target=""_blank"">Using the &ldquo;Breathemobile,&rdquo;</a> Presto collected pollution data throughout Allegheny County and turned this data into a series of color-coded maps that reveal where pollutants are found throughout the county.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Industrial facilities such as the Clairton Coke Works that emit large amounts of pollution can affect communities miles away,&rdquo; Presto states. &ldquo;Pittsburgh&rsquo;s river valleys augment the problem because the emissions can get trapped down there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Deborah Gentile also presented her recent childhood asthma study that is contingent with Presto&rsquo;s work. She found that among 1,200 elementary school children who live near sources of pollution, such as the Clairton Coke Works, about 35 percent have asthma, and two thirds of them, or 24 percent, actually knew they had asthma.</p>

<p>The national asthma rate is about 8 percent and in Allegheny County, it&rsquo;s 13 percent.</p>

<p>Children are more susceptible to the effects of air pollution because, compared to adults, they have a larger lung surface area in relation to their body weight, and breathe about 50 percent more air per kilogram of body weight.</p>

<p>Gentile states, &ldquo;Near these point sources of pollution, we tend to see more minority families as well as more lower socioeconomic status, and that&rsquo;s what they find in other cities as well. These are the people who can&rsquo;t afford to live elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kids who are exposed to the highest level of particulate matter, as well as the highest level black carbon, are twice as likely to have a diagnosis of asthma than those who are exposed to the lower levels. So, that really has to be a call for public policy change to clean this air up,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>While this all may seem a bit daunting and out of your hands, Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s CREATE Lab would argue otherwise. With their citizen science tools such as the <a href=""http://smellpgh.org/"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;Smell Pgh&rdquo; app</a>, where you can submit real-time data on your location and what kind of industrial smell you are encountering directly to the Allegheny County Health Department, any Pittsburgher (including YOU) can help in holding industry and its regulatory agency, in this case the Allegheny County Health Department, accountable.</p>

<p>In addition to monitoring the air in your community by <a href=""http://breatheproject.org/learn/breathe-cam/"" target=""_blank"">watching the Breathe Cam</a> or renting a <a href=""https://www.specksensor.com/"" target=""_blank"">Speck Sensor</a> from your library, we need you to <a href=""http://www.achd.net/board/meetings.html"" target=""_blank"">speak out to the Allegheny County Health Department Board of Health</a> meetings to voice your concerns and why we all have the right to breathe clean air.</p>

“Art of the Heel” and “Forces of Nature”- Music Supports PennFuture,1/29/2018,"<p>During the 2017 Philadelphia Fringe Festival Sept. 23, PennFuture was the recipient of an amazing benefit concert put on by Cory O&rsquo; Niell Walker, <a href=""https://cookiediorio.com/"" target=""_blank"">also known as Cookie Diorio.</a> Cookie and her musical team, Garrett Obrycki and Matt Brower, held the concert, which was sponsored by the First Unitarian Church&rsquo;s Social Justice Ministry. The concert celebrated &ldquo;Forces of Nature&rdquo; with Cookie&rsquo;s wildly original tunes, in addition to operatic and Broadway favorites.</p>

<p>And how Cookie can sing! Cookie is a diverse performer, composer, and designer who performs multiple genres, including opera, musical theater, art song and dance. She holds a Masters Degree in vocal performance from Ithaca College, where she also studied composition. Cookie also has a popular voice studio in Philadelphia and performs regularly with The Opera Company of Philadelphia and The Mendelssohn Club Chorus.</p>

<p>After Cookie began managing the &ldquo;Art of the Heel,&rdquo; a special star was born. Cookie told me she loves using her 6.5 inch heels to &ldquo;celebrate diversity, promote social justice and create civically engaged art by hosting world class music showcases to benefit nonprofit organizations making a difference in our communities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked Cookie how she thought of the idea to give back to nonprofit organizations through music. Originally, she did not know where to start. She began looking at organizations that shared her values and concerns, but there were so many! Cookie said, &ldquo;It was a learning process for me and I&rsquo;ve learned there is no shame in not knowing all of the answers right away. I am just committed to learning more to make good decisions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Cookie, the next step was this: &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t give a massive donation, how can I put my art together to give back? Yes, I am giving my time and time is valuable. But I can&rsquo;t do this alone. I am so lucky to have friends and colleagues who hold the same beliefs I do. They fully support what I choose and are gracious enough to give their time. They tell me, &lsquo;Give my entire fee to the organization.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This brings us to how she chose PennFuture as the beneficiary for September&rsquo;s concert. Cookie believes in environmental advocacy and learning more about the environmental issues we face in our state. What caught her eye when she checked PennFuture out was, &ldquo;the many ways in which PennFuture works.&rdquo; She was inspired by all of our legislative and legal work. She could not believe how many pieces of legislation go through the General Assembly. She puts that part of our work on the macro level:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The really big things that are important in making a difference.&rdquo; But it was also the other things we do regularly like our outreach team&rsquo;s work on environmental matters that also impressed her.</p>

<p>We finished our conversation when Cookie quoted something I had said at the start of that brilliant performance in September. Graciously allowing me to talk about PennFuture&rsquo;s work before she sang, I ended my talk saying, &ldquo;What we are fighting for is what all of us need as human beings - clean air and clean water. These are a necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cookie said, &ldquo;That says it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thank you, Cookie, for supporting us with your incredible talent! Yours was a performance I won&rsquo;t soon forget!</p>

Our Clean Energy Future Requires Leadership from All,1/25/2018,"<div><strong>What will it take for Pennsylvania to break away from its dependence on dirty, unhealthy, old fuels like coal and gas, and move enthusiastically and proudly into a clean energy future?</strong></div>

<div></div>

<div>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economic reliance on fossil fuel runs deeper than the veins of coal we insist on still extracting. In reality, our fossil fuel economy is as tenuous as the bedrock we frack and decimate to release natural gas into our lives. What will it take to leave it in the ground, and move boldly into a new energy, climate-friendly future driven by renewables and efficiency?</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>That &ldquo;future&rdquo; is taking place, right now, in other states that have embraced clean energy jobs.</strong>Neighboring states are making business development investments and creating incentives that attract wind, solar and related-manufacturing jobs, and create a new workforce to support clean energy industries. They are increasing public investment in research and development and innovation. This is happening in places like New Jersey, where new Governor Murphy <a href=""https://www.murphy4nj.com/issue/building-a-clean-energy-economy/"" target=""_blank"">prioritized clean energy during his campaign</a>,and in neighboring New York, where Governor Cuomo <a href=""https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-launches-5-billion-clean-energy-fund-grow-new-york-s-clean-energy-economy"" target=""_blank"">launched a $5 billion fund to grow New York&rsquo;s clean energy economy.</a></div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Other states are reaping the economic benefits of clean energy now, at lower cost to public health, environment and climate than what Pennsylvanians must endure through the dominance of dirty energy.</strong>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s government is simply doing too much to facilitate the success of the fossil fuel industry, including sweetening fossil fuel development with exorbitant subsidies such as the nearly <a href=""http://www.toxicneighbor.org"" target=""_blank"">$1.6 billion that ex-Governor Tom Corbett provided Shell Chemical Appalachia</a> to build an ethane cracker plant in Beaver County so the world can have more plastic. Governor Wolf supports the plant.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>So, what needs to happen to wake Pennsylvania up to the future before the new energy economy passes us by and we&rsquo;re left unable to catch up with clean energy states?</strong></div>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Clean energy leadership and vision at the highest level of state government, namely through our next governor. </strong>Now that we are witnessing the success of the natural gas business, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s future governor must step up and help level the playing field between the fossil fuel industry and the clean energy industry. <a href=""https://www.e2.org/pennsylvania/"">Clean energy jobs are outpacing fossil fuel jobs in Pennsylvania</a> and deserve political support and public investment. The new governor must be prepared to present a package of incentives for clean energy, workforce development and greenhouse gas reduction.</li>
	<li><strong>Clean energy champions in our communities</strong> are needed to step up and run for elected office.</li>
	<li><strong>Anti-environmental climate deniers in the state legislature must be held accountable</strong> for their unabashed embrace of natural gas and <a href=""http://marcellusmoney.org/"">their acceptance of gas lobby campaign support.</a>And if they will not be held to account, we need to turn them out of office. This will take time, but elections matter and can create long-lasting change.</li>
	<li><strong>Community activists must roll up the red carpet and pave over the yellow brick road being traveled by pipeline companies, the plastics industry and natural gas businesses and their lobbyists. </strong>Communities must begin to work in earnest on a viable clean energy economic development vision for their communities.</li>
	<li><strong>Statewide environmental advocacy organizations must do more to assist on-the-ground activists, through legal and policy assistance. </strong>Through our work in Harrisburg, organizations like PennFuture, PennEnvironment, Sierra Club and others must hold the line to defend existing laws and regulations in a hostile anti-regulatory state legislature. Here at PennFuture, we are planning projects with individual communities that are taking their clean energy and climate future into their own hands.Working in these communities, PennFuture will offer technical and planning assistance, and help with project development to local outcomes of reductions in the cost of energy and greenhouse gas reductions.</li>
	<li><strong>Policies must be adopted that continue to prioritize energy efficiency and clean renewable energy.</strong>This means defending our Act 129 energy efficiency program, strengthening our Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, and not wasting billions of dollars in tax breaks subsidizing dirty fossil fuels.</li>
	<li><strong>All of us need to play our part:</strong> change out your light bulbs, switch to energy star appliances, act on your ability to choose your electric supplier and choose clean energy by visiting <a href=""http://www.papowerswitch.com"" target=""_blank"">www.papowerswitch.com</a>, choose hybrid and electric vehicles, call an elected official and express your views, support your favorite environmental organization working hard for their missions.</li>

2018 Work is Key to Reaching State's Clean Water Goals,1/25/2018,"<p>The Phase III Watershed Implementation Steering Committee meets this week in Harrisburg at a pivotal time for the Chesapeake Bay clean-up. In December, the steering committee met to discuss the mid-point assessment and to gather feedback from stakeholders to the PA Department of Environmental Protection and the Principals&rsquo; Staff Committee of the Chesapeake Bay Program.</p>

<p>As we turn to 2018, we are entering into the critical second half of the period for Pennsylvania to meets is pollution reduction goals by 2025, set by the Total Maximum Daily Load in 2010. For a number of reasons, progress made this year and the actions taken by the Phase III WIP Steering Committee and the state agencies will be crucial in setting the stage for how well Pennsylvania steps up to meet its obligations.<br />
<br />
In December, early information from the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program&rsquo;s model is showing that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 2025 targets for reducing nutrients may be 7 million pounds less for nitrogen and 270,000 pounds less for phosphorous than originally thought. While this is welcome news, PennFuture and clean water stakeholders plan to continue holding the state agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the WIP Steering Committee to strong commitments for our clean water. Pennsylvania needs a strong Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan in order to meet its goals and restore thousands of miles of streams and creeks.<br />
<br />
Last week, DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell informed the Citizens Advisory Council on DEP&rsquo;s work with the Chesapeake Bay clean-up and shared that the Chesapeake Bay Program should be releasing its initial nutrient and sediment reduction targets in February, finalizing them in May.</p>

<p>Secretary McDonnell rightly admits that Pennsylvania still faces uphill challenges in reaching the pollution reduction goals. While it remains a key concern for clean water stakeholders in Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Secretary McDonnell told the Citizens Advisory Council that the Conowingo Dam issue will be dealt on its own with its separate watershed implementation plan created by the owner of the dam &ndash; Exelon, EPA, Maryland, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.<br />
<br />
2018 is shaping up to be a very important year for Chesapeake Bay and clean water policy in regard to the WIP and state agencies&rsquo; enforcement and work in water quality and restoration. On top of these challenges and movements in the right direction by our key policymakers in Pennsylvania, legislators in Harrisburg threaten the progress of the Chesapeake Bay clean-up and all of its stakeholders by continuing to challenge critical state funding for environmental projects, river basin commissions, and clean water programming at the Departments of Agriculture, Environmental Protection, and Conservation and Natural Resources. State elected officials are also actively seeking the roll-back of essential regulations to keep our water clean and are trying their best to implement a regime of supposed reform.<br />
<br />
At the federal level, while the constant challenge to reach a deal on permanent appropriations from this Congress and presidential administration appear elusive, we have a few strong bills emerging from watershed legislators to help increase our buffers and funding to farmers as a part of the 2018 Farm Bill, including S.2139 from Senator Van Hollen (D-MD), and HR4420 from Congressman Bobby Scott (D-VA).</p>

<p>At this time, we need a strong state government commitment to restoring and protecting our drinking water in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>PennFuture remains an integral part of the WIP development and discussions and state and federal levels of government for clean water.</p>

Replacing the Guardrails,1/24/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Larry J. Schweiger, President Emeritus, PennFuture</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Note: With so many unfathomable, discordant, and unsettling things emanating from the Trump administration, it is important that the numerous environmental threats and terrible actions summarized herein not get lost in the cacophony. We are losing much and we must work together as never before to find new ways to push back.</em></p>

<p>A number of years ago, my youngest daughter was driving back to college after her winter break and hit a patch of black ice and slid into the guardrails. I spent $500 replacing a single section of guardrail on I-79. I share this because I am watching the Trump administration ripping down critical environmental guardrails. Watching the loss of guardrail after guardrail, the questions I have been wrestling with include: Can the guardrails be repaired or replaced? If so, at what cost? Is there such a thing as being too late?</p>

<p>Until the recent tax bill was signed, many in the media had been suggesting that Trump isn&rsquo;t getting anything done. That was simply not true. While Trump was distracting us with his perverse tweets and endless lies, important regulations have been rolled back and in many cases, ended completely at an astounding rate. The Trump administration has been demonizing government, reminiscent of Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s rhetoric, but its actions go far beyond Reagan&rsquo;s. As Steve Bannon once boasted, the Trump appointees are &ldquo;deconstructing the administrative state&rdquo; at a pace that is hard to follow, and even harder to resist.</p>

<p>At the Environmental Protection Agency under Scott Pruitt, we are witnessing the abandonment of the Clean Water Rules, the retreat from the Paris Accord, moving to end the Clean Power Plan and the endangerment findings, gutting the highly successful auto rules, the national clean air guidelines and on and on I could go. Harvard University has created an environmental rollback tracker that has identified 40 environmental protections. <a href=""http://environment.law.harvard.edu/policy-initiative/regulatory-rollback-tracker/"" target=""_blank"">You can sign up for alerts here.</a></p>

<p>The failure to enforce existing law and the many inadequate settlements of prior enforcement actions, coupled with the stripping of publically funded climate science from their websites is and should be a continuing outrage. Despite the legacy of abandoned mines and polluted waterways in virtually every state where coal has been mined, the administration will not require the mining industry to provide financial assurances demonstrating that they have the capacity to clean up any and all pollution caused by mining. We are witnessing a race to the bottom with dark money and its appointed surrogates in charge of the very agencies that were created to protect our environment.</p>

<p>The tax bill got a lot of attention for the way it further advantaged the super wealthy and further concentrated wealth even more at a time when there is already grave inequities. What got very little if any coverage in the midst of this was the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge giveaway. To buy Senator Lisa Murkowski&rsquo;s vote for a bad tax bill, the Arctic Refuge was put up for oil development as an offset to some of the tax cuts for the wealthy. This is America&rsquo;s last remaining pristine Serengeti. Covering 29,800 square miles of untrammeled wilderness, it will now be exploited by the oil interests who will destroy the core calving area of the Porcupine Caribou herd that has been finding insect relief along the coastal plain for millennia. The coastal plain is a critical mosquito relief habitat considered by the Gwich&rsquo;in people to be sacred for 20,000 years.</p>

<p>Adding insult to this ecological injury, U. S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has put virtually all of the off-shore waters up for oil and gas leasing. While he was forced by their Republican lawmakers to retreat on the waters off the Florida coast for political reasons, the remaining waters are put at risk while Zinke abandoned all the important rules put in place after the disastrous BP oil spill, and he has scaled back the enforcement and monitoring procedures put in place to avoid another massive spill. Lessons learned from the BP spill are soon forgotten.</p>

<p>At the request of Utah&rsquo;s uranium industry and other special interests, Zinke cut the heart out of two important monuments (Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante) so they can be leased for mineral development. He diminished the size of a total of six monuments including the lifting of fishing restrictions in a critical ocean sanctuary established by George W. Bush.</p>

<p>In another disgusting action, Zinke doubled the cost of entering a National Park to seventy dollars and in seventeen parks the fee will be seventy-five dollars. These fees will be prohibitive for many young families, for minorities and especially for the poor struggling to just make ends meet. Even before the doubling of the fees, only seven percent of the visitors to the parks were black according to a survey commissioned by the National Park Service. Do we really want our National Parks to be restricted to a privileged few?</p>

<p>Nine of 12 members of the Congressionally sanctioned National Park System Advisory Board resigned because Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke ignored the board for a year. The committee established in 1935 has been vital to the Park Service. In recent years the committee has advised the Interior Department on how to deal with global warming, emphasized the need to protect American historical sites and advised the service on how to encourage more young people to the parks.</p>

<p>If that was not enough, Zinke announced on Dec.22 that he had come up with a new legal interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act that strictly prohibits the unregulated killing of birds. Migratory birds landing on toxic waste impoundments often associated with fracking are often killed and have been treated as a violation of the law. The Zinke memorandum reinterprets the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to allow corporations to kill migratory birds outside of carefully established seasons and bag limits contrary to the long-standing interpretation by every administration since 1970.</p>

<p>Trump just put a 30 percenttariff on solar panels imported from China. This pushes the cost of solar higher. He is just one year in and we must expect more damaging environmental policies. Those of us deeply concerned with the environment must come to the realization that we must become much more active politically and begin to work with those seeking fundamental reforms to restore our democracy.</p>

<p>The environment will not be protected until we address the broken democracy. Environmentalists like so many Americans are shell-shocked. It&rsquo;s a much more complicated situation and we are forced to dig deeper into our plight and find pathways to recover our floundering democracy. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court took an important first step this week overthrowing one of the most egregious gerrymandered Congressional districts in the country. Much more must be done.</p>

Supreme Court Decision May Impact Trump Administration’s Attempt to Repeal the Clean Water Rule,1/23/2018,"<p>The Supreme Court issued a <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-299_8nk0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">unanimous decision</a> yesterday that challenges to EPA&rsquo;s Clean Water Rule (CWR) were properly brought before federal District Courts, and not federal appellate courts. The decision is not about the validity of EPA&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;waters of the United State,&rdquo; but instead involves the procedural issue as to where challenges to EPA&rsquo;s rule must be filed. The decision is important, nonetheless, because it invalidates an appellate court decision that had prevented the CWR from taking affect across the Nation.</p>

<p>The issue before the court was which federal courts could review challenges to the 2015 CWR, which defined &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; under the Clean Water Act. After EPA promulgated the rule, numerous lawsuits were filed challenging the CWR in both federal district courts and federal courts of appeal or so-called circuit courts. In one of those cases, the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a nationwide stay that prevented the CWR from taking effect.</p>

<p>The government argued that the 6th Circuit had jurisdiction to issue its decision. Typically, challenges to EPA rules must be filed with a district court and not an appellate court like the 6th Circuit. However, the Clean Water Act provides seven categories of EPA actions that can be challenged in circuit courts. The government argued that this was one of those types of actions that could, and should, be challenged in circuit courts.</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court rejected all of the government&rsquo;s legal and policy arguments. The Court held that the CWR is &ldquo;a definitional rule that clarifies the scope of the statutory term&rdquo; and while litigating before the district courts may be less efficient and may result in a less uniform regulatory landscape, the plain language of the Clean Water Act shows that Congress made clear that rules like the CWR must be reviewed first by the federal district courts.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision will impact the nationwide stay of the CWR imposed by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. Once the 6th Circuit dismisses the case, as directed by the Supreme Court, the CWR will be reinstated in all states &ndash; including Pennsylvania &ndash; except in those 13 western states for which the District Court of North Dakota issued a stay on the CWR in 2015.</p>

<p>Under the CWR, EPA defined &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; in a manner that clarified that protections under Clean Water Act covered small intermittent and ephemeral streams and wetlands.These waters are critical not only in their own right, but also for the water quality of the larger bodies of water of which these smaller streams are a part.</p>

<p>This decision will also impact the Trump Administration&rsquo;s 2017 attempts to repeal the CWR. The government sought to preserve the circuit court&rsquo;s jurisdiction over the CWR because they are generally viewed as being less inclined to overturn federal agency rules, which might have made it harder for environmental groups to challenge Trump&rsquo;s effort to repeal and replace the existing CWR.</p>

How to Effectively Comment on the DRBC’s Draft Fracking Regulations,1/8/2018,"<div>On Nov.30, 2017, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) <a href=""http://www.state.nj.us/drbc/meetings/proposed/notice_hydraulic-fracturing.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>issued draft regulations</strong></a> regarding fracking within the Delaware River Basin.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>In short, the draft regulations do the following:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Prohibits high-volume hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in shale and other rock formations within the Basin;</li>
	<li>Regulates Delaware River water use for fracking outside of the Basin (inter-basin water transfer); and</li>
	<li>Regulates the treatment and disposal of produced water/wastewater from fracking from outside of the Basin.</li>
</ul>

<div>As with any proposed regulations, DRBC is accepting public comment on its draft fracking regulations.Submitting written comments on proposed environmental actions is a way to make your voice heard and to influence decisions on the issues you care about.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Public participation is an essential part of the rulemaking process.In particular, public comments can do the following:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Strengthen a regulation;</li>
	<li>Create a comprehensive and accurate record; and</li>
	<li>Support an appropriate and informed decisionmaking process.</li>
</ul>

<div>While PennFuture continues to review and develop its own comments, we strongly encourage each and every one of you to write to DRBC to express your gratitude (banning fracking in the Basin!) and your concerns (allowing other dangerous activities).</div>

<div></div>

<div>Written public comments can be as short or as detailed as you want them to be, but there are a few tips and techniques that can help make your comments persuasive.</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>And so, PennFuture developed a short video on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQbNpEmkTQ&amp;feature=youtu.be"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;How to Effectively Engage in the Public Commenting Process.</a>&rdquo; These tips include:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Use specific examples and highlight how the regulations could impact you, your family, your community, and the natural resources you love.</li>
	<li>Use persuasive language throughout.</li>
	<li>Present your comments in a clear, concise, and respectful manner.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>DRBC is accepting public comment on these draft regulations until 5 p.m. on March 30.</strong></div>

<div></div>

<div>Unfortunately, the only way to submit written comments on these draft regulations is through DRBC&rsquo;s online comments webpage at <a href=""http://dockets.drbc.commentinput.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://dockets.drbc.commentinput.com/</a>. DRBC is not accepting emailed, faxed, or hand- or postal-delivered comments. (PennFuture submitted this letter regarding DRBC&rsquo;s flawed public participation process.)</div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>Public Hearings</strong></div>

<div>The DRBC is also holding public hearings during which it will accept oral comments on its draft fracking regulations. It&rsquo;s not too late to register to attend these hearings and hear others&rsquo; concerns. Although the deadline to register to speak has passed, DRBC has indicated that you may still be able to register to speak if time is available.</div>

"How You Can Get Involved: ""Our Water Campaign""",1/2/2018,"<p>Although very much underplayed by the general public and the media, <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2016/2/3/10904120/lead-exposure-flint-pennsylvania"" target=""_blank"">Pittsburgh is facing a drinking water crisis</a>, with lead levels still high in many homes and water rates increasing by 28 percent in 2018. </p>

<p><strong>The <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/OurH2o/about/?ref=page_internal"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;Our Water Campaign&rdquo;</a></strong><br />
Comprised of Pittsburgh United, Clean Water Action, Pennsylvania Interfaith Impact Network, Sierra Club, Nine Mile Run Watershed, Hill District Consensus Group, Thomas Merton Center, One Pennsylvania, and PennFuture, the campaign is a coalition that believes safe, clean water is a vital resource for the Pittsburgh region and that the lack of investment and repair of our public water system threatens our economy and public health.</p>

<p>The need for safe and healthy drinking water is too important to be left in the hands of corporations. The profit motive will always come before the needs of residents. We need solutions that treat our public water as a common good and human right for all, where residents&rsquo; health isn&rsquo;t put at risk so corporations can turn a profit. Residents have made it clear that they want more control and accountability over the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, not less.</p>

<p>So, when Washington, D.C.-based Infrastructure Management Group (IMG), hired by the city to explore options to rebuild PWSA, suggested a public trust to govern the authority, we have to ask if this is the best decision for the residents of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>If IMG&rsquo;s recommendation was implemented, the public trust would be placed under the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Public Utility Commission, and would then lease its infrastructure to a private entity and dissolve PWSA&rsquo;s current board.</p>

<p>However, a functional PWSA that keeps the authority completely public is achievable!</p>

<p>PWSA has listened to public input and has passed a plan to replace lead service lines, invest in green infrastructure, and protect low-income residents with a Customer Assistance Program. <a href=""http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/932_PWSA_Report.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>You can read the full plan here.</strong></a></p>

<p>In addition, thanks to the recent passage of a new state law, PWSA may finally have the funding and the authority to replace private lead lines, with permission from homeowners.</p>
