2025 Supreme Court Environmental Decisions Recap: Limiting EPA’s Use of “End-Result” Provisions in NPDES Permits,12/31/2025,"<p>As we look ahead to 2026, we’re sharing a series of blog posts recapping some of the most damaging U.S. Supreme Court decisions that will shape our ability to protect the environment for decades to come. (Blog 4/4)</p> <h3><strong>Supreme Court Limits EPA’s Use of “End-Result” Provisions in NPDES Permits</strong></h3> <p>In <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-753_f2bh.pdf"">City &amp; County of San Francisco v. EPA, 145 S. Ct. 704 (2025)</a>, the Supreme Court struck down certain narrative (as opposed to numeric) standards that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had included in San Francisco’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit under the Clean Water Act (CWA).</p> <p>NPDES permits are required for discharges of pollutants from a point source into waters of the United States. In this case, San Francisco’s wastewater treatment plant operated under a permit issued by the EPA.</p> <p>Typically, an NPDES permit specifies discharge limits or treatment requirements, which may be numeric (e.g., pH levels) or narrative (e.g., “no visible sheen”). If the permit holder complies with those requirements, the Clean Water Act’s “permit shield” provision deems them in compliance with the Act. This framework provides regulatory certainty: following the permit’s explicit terms should protect the permittee from additional liability.</p> <p>However, in 2019, the EPA added two provisions to San Francisco’s wastewater treatment permit that imposed liability if the receiving waters failed to meet certain water quality standards — regardless of whether the City had met all other permit conditions. One provision prohibited any discharge that “contributes to” a violation of applicable water quality standards. The other prohibited any discharge that “creates pollution, contamination, or nuisance” under California law. These types of provisions are quite common in NPDES permits and can provide flexibility by allowing permittees to determine the most cost-effective way to comply.</p> <p>The Court invalidated these provisions, coining the term “end-result provisions” to describe them. It held that the Clean Water Act authorizes the EPA to impose limitations within a permittee’s control — such as limits on the facility’s own discharges — but not broad requirements tied to downstream water quality conditions influenced by multiple sources. By requiring San Francisco to ensure downstream water quality regardless of other pollution contributors, the Court concluded that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority. This decision removes a longstanding tool from the EPA’s regulatory toolbox and will likely make it harder to keep our waters clean.</p> <p>This case also illustrates how <a href=""/Blog-Item-PA-and-a-Post-Chevron-World"">Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</a> continues to reshape judicial review of agency actions. In <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Court ended the <em>Chevron</em> doctrine, under which courts deferred to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutes. Now, judges independently interpret statutory meaning.</p> <p>Here, the Court analyzed the Clean Water Act and concluded that Congress empowered the EPA to regulate only a permittee’s own discharges — not to hold it responsible for the condition of the water body as a whole. Under <em>Chevron</em>, the Court would have asked whether the EPA’s interpretation of the statute was reasonable and, if so, deferred to the agency’s judgment. Under <em>Loper Bright</em>, however, the Court claimed the final authority to determine how the EPA and other agencies may fulfill their statutory mandates. In this case, that meant concluding that the EPA’s long-used “end-result provisions” are not authorized.</p> <p>PennFuture’s attorneys are working hard to protect our environment and the rule of law.

2025 Supreme Court Environmental Decisions Recap: Agencies Don’t Have to Chase Every “What If”,12/31/2025,"<p>As we look ahead to 2026, we’re sharing a series of blog posts recapping some of the worst U.S. Supreme Court decisions that will shape our ability to protect the environment for decades to come. (Blog 3/4)</p> <h3><strong>Supreme Court Says Agencies Don’t Have to Chase Every “What If” in Environmental Reviews</strong></h3> <p>When the federal government wants to build or permit a major project — like a railroad, pipeline, or highway — it must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA’s core requirement is straightforward: before moving forward, the agency must study how the project could affect the environment and determine whether those impacts are “significant.” If they are, the agency must prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) analyzing those impacts and potential mitigation measures. NEPA does not dictate what decision the agency must make; it simply requires that the agency has “taken a hard look” at environmental consequences before acting.</p> <p>In <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-06/23975sevencountyfinal.pdf"">Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, 145 S. Ct. 1497 (2025)</a>, seven Utah counties sought to build an 88-mile railroad in the Uinta Basin. The responsible agency, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, prepared a 3,600-page EIS examining impacts ranging from wildlife to air quality. The agency also acknowledged other potential mining and refining projects in the region, but because those projects were speculative and not formally proposed, it did not analyze them in detail.</p> <p>A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., held that this was insufficient, concluding that the agency should have taken a deeper look at these potential future projects. The Supreme Court disagreed. It held that NEPA does not require agencies to analyze every hypothetical project that might someday materialize. Instead, agencies must focus on the project actually under review and its reasonably foreseeable effects.</p> <p>As a result, it is now more difficult for challengers to argue that an EIS is incomplete. Opponents must show that the agency failed to consider reasonably foreseeable impacts — a demanding standard. The Court emphasized that agencies retain substantial discretion in preparing an EIS, including decisions about its length, scope, and level of detail.</p> <p>This ruling also clarifies where <a href=""/Blog-Item-PA-and-a-Post-Chevron-World"">Loper Bright</a>’s shift in power does — and does not — apply. In <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Supreme Court held that courts, not agencies, have the final authority to interpret federal statutes, ending the longstanding <em>Chevron</em> doctrine. That decision allows courts to more closely scrutinize the legal boundaries of agency authority. But in <em>Seven County</em>, the Court made clear that when a statute’s requirements are clear, agencies still retain discretion over the technical details of implementation. Even if that discretion allows agencies to significantly narrow the scope of impacts considered under NEPA, the Court signaled that such judgments remain within the agency’s expertise.</p> <p>At the same time, NEPA’s protections are being weakened through executive action. Earlier in 2025, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) — the agency charged with implementing NEPA — revoked its NEPA regulations, allowing federal agencies to rescind or weaken their own implementing regulations, including replacing binding rules with non-binding guidance. Much like the narrowing of the definition of “waters of the United States” after <em>Sackett</em>, environmental review authority is increasingly shifting to the states, many of which lack robust environmental review laws.</p> <p>PennFuture’s attorneys are working hard to protect our environment and the rule of law.

2025 Supreme Court Environmental Decisions Recap: Sackett v. EPA and the Clean Water Act,12/30/2025,"<p>As we look forward to 2026, we wanted to share with you a series of blogs to recap of some of the worst U.S. Supreme Court decisions that will shape our ability to protect our environment for decades to come. (Blog 2/4)</p>

<h2><strong>Where the Water Flows: Sackett v. EPA and the Clean Water Act</strong></h2>

<p>In 2023, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a major decision in <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-454_4g15.pdf"">Sackett v. EPA, 598 U.S. 651, 143 S. Ct. 1322 (2023)</a>, redefining the scope of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and reshaping how federal jurisdiction over wetlands is determined. While not as headline-grabbing as some other recent cases, <em>Sackett</em> has quietly redrawn the map of environmental protection in the United States.</p>

<p>The case began when Michael and Chantell Sackett purchased a plot of land in Idaho to build a home. Part of their property contained wetlands, which they backfilled during construction. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claimed this action violated the CWA, which prohibits &ldquo;the discharge of any pollutant&rdquo; into &ldquo;navigable waters.&rdquo; 33 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1311(a), 1362(12)(A). This prohibition applies to &ldquo;the waters of the United States&rdquo; (WOTUS) a term that sounds straightforward, but, as Justice Alito asked in his opinion, what exactly does that mean?</p>

<p>Before <em>Sackett</em>, the EPA interpreted WOTUS broadly. In addition to traditionally navigable waters, it claimed jurisdiction over waters with a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; to navigable waters, a standard that allowed regulation of wetlands and other features connected to navigable waters in ways not always obvious to the naked eye.</p>

<p>The Court rejected this &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; test as inconsistent with the CWA&rsquo;s text and as granting the EPA jurisdiction far beyond what Congress intended. In its place, the Court adopted a narrower two-part test: First, the party asserting jurisdiction over an adjacent wetland must prove that the adjacent body of water constitutes a &ldquo;water of the United States.&rdquo; Second, the party must show that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to distinguish where the water ends and the wetland begins. This holding significantly restricts the reach of the CWA, limiting jurisdiction to wetlands that are physically and visibly connected on the surface to covered waters. Wetlands that are nearby but separated by barriers such as roads, even if hydrologically connected underground, are now outside the EPA&rsquo;s regulatory reach.</p>

<p>The decision has two immediate effects. First, it narrows the federal government&rsquo;s authority under <a href=""https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=code+of+federal+regulations&amp;f=treesort&amp;num=4317"">33 U.S.C. &sect; 1344(g)(1)</a> and <a href=""https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-2007-title33-section1362&amp;num=0&amp;edition=2007"">&sect; 1362(7)</a>, redefining &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; in a way that excludes many wetlands previously covered. Second, it shifts regulatory responsibility for those excluded wetlands to individual states, creating the possibility of a patchwork of protections that vary widely across the country&mdash;the very thing the CWA was developed to protect against.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <em>Sackett</em> was just the beginning. This November, EPA released its new definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; that is even more restrictive than the Supreme Court directed in <em>Sackett</em>.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/Wetlands_Report_R_25-03-B_05_locked.pdf"">recent calculations by our friends at NRDC</a>, this rule could remove federal protections from a majority of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s wetlands. Wetlands not only ensure cleaner water flowing downstream, they also:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduce flooding </li>
	<li>Filter harmful pollution </li>
	<li>Provide essential fish and wildlife habitat</li>
	<li>Store carbon</li>
</ul>

<p>Without streams and wetlands to serve as natural buffers, floodwaters rise faster and hit harder, leaving homeowners, businesses, and taxpayers with massive bills for damage, cleanup, and emergency response. Communities across Pennsylvania&ndash;both big and small&ndash; will face increased infrastructure and water treatment costs if protections are removed.</p>

<p>And while Pennsylvania is lucky to have strong state-level water quality protections, we are not immune from the impact of the &ldquo;Polluted Water Rule.&rdquo; We must <a href=""https://secure.everyaction.com/DySHjxuLw0ivAE9lyrxzbw2?emci=1a89d85c-90df-f011-8194-000d3a1ec8c6&amp;emdi=4c09cddc-20e0-f011-8195-000d3a1d58aa&amp;ceid=6532780"">act now and speak up</a> against the gutting of the Clean Water Act!

2025 Supreme Court Environmental Decisions Recap: Loper Bright in Action: NRC v. Texas,12/29/2025,"<p>As we look forward to 2026, we wanted to share with you a series of blogs to recap of some of the worst U.S. Supreme Court decisions that will shape our ability to protect our environment for decades to come. (Blog 1/4)</p>

<h3><strong>Loper Bright in Action: NRC v. Texas (June 2025)</strong></h3>

<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s recent decisions have fundamentally reshaped the way federal law is interpreted and applied. In our earlier post, <a href=""/Blog-Item-PA-and-a-Post-Chevron-World"">PA and a Post &ldquo;Chevron&rdquo; World</a>, we discussed the landmark case <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf"">Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024)</a>, which overturned the 1984 precedent of <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/resource/usrep.usrep467837/"">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984)</a>.</p>

<p>Under <em>Chevron</em>, when Congress left gaps or used vague language in a statute, courts would defer to an agency&rsquo;s reasonable interpretation&mdash;trusting the &ldquo;masters of the subject&rdquo; to apply their technical expertise. This approach recognized that Congress cannot predict every future development. For example, in the Clean Air Act, Congress avoided creating a closed list of pollutants, leaving room for agencies to address newly discovered threats to public health and the environment.</p>

<p>But in <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Court shifted that responsibility to the judiciary. Now, judges, not agencies with knowledge and expertise, decide the meaning of ambiguous statutory terms. While agencies can still offer expert perspectives, their interpretations no longer receive automatic deference.</p>

<p>On June 18, 2025, the Supreme Court applied this post-Loper approach in <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-1300_b97c.pdf"">NRC v. Texas, 145 S. Ct. 1762 (2025)</a>. The Court held that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) lacked authority under the Atomic Energy Act to license private interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. Reading the statute closely, the Court found that Congress assigned responsibility for long-term nuclear waste storage to the Department of Energy, not private licensees, and that, absent clear congressional authorization, the NRC could not grant such licenses.</p>

<p>The decision has sweeping implications for the nuclear energy sector. It removes a key tool, the ability of private entities to store spent fuel, and shifts the entire burden of storage to the federal government, even though federal capacity is already stretched thin.</p>

<p>Supporters of the Court&rsquo;s shift may welcome the move as a check on agency overreach and a reaffirmation of Congress&rsquo;s role in lawmaking. Critics, however, warn that it could undermine long-standing regulations that protect public health, safety, and the environment. Without agency deference, well-established rules could be challenged, and potentially dismantled, by parties seeking to avoid compliance.</p>

<p>In theory, Congress could respond by updating laws to meet evolving challenges. In practice, a politically divided legislature may lack the capacity or will to act quickly. For decades, expert-driven agency interpretations have helped bridge that gap, freeing Congress to address other pressing national needs. Time will only tell just how far <em>Loper Bright</em> will go in eroding federal protections, and this case was just one of the first examples.</p>

Introducing PennFuture's Fall 2025 Interns,11/10/2025,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p><br />
But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognize that we need to be more involved with cultivating the people that will continue to support our mission. Our staff have a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation. <br />
With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment. </p>



<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting Pennsylvania as well as to further their potential environmental careers. We&rsquo;ve seen success on this front as many of our legal interns have found work in the Pennsylvania environmental legal space. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere. </p>

<p><br />
Over the past five years, our interns have made it possible for PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team to do more, faster, and better! They have supported our litigation efforts against water polluters and fracked-gas facilities, they have drafted comments in support of stronger regulatory protections across the Commonwealth, and they have helped our attorneys strategize and execute impactful legal actions. We are grateful for all of the hard work, passion, and dedication of our legal interns. </p>

<h3><br />
This fall, we have two fantastic students, including a returning intern, joining us who bring their unique backgrounds and experiences to our mission. We&rsquo;ve asked our interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</h3>



<p><strong>Ayah Manalastas, Third-Year Student at Penn State Dickinson Law</strong></p>

<p><img  class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/HeadshotAyahManalastas%5F24%5F4x6.jpg"" style=""width: 225px; height: 338px; float: left;"" />As a returning legal intern, coming back to PennFuture offered a unique opportunity to build on last semester&rsquo;s foundation and deepen my knowledge as I continue to explore the intersection of energy and environmental law. My spring internship opened my eyes to the complexity of these issues, and I realized there was so much more to learn. Motivated by this realization and the sweeping effects of the policy changes from the new administration, I was eager to return and contribute my skills to the organization during a dynamic and challenging time for energy and environmental advocacy.</p>

<p>My several years of experience in energy law makes me well-suited to support PennFuture as it navigates new challenges in this field, particularly with issues involving large load integration and the growing impact of data centers. I am grateful for the invaluable support and mentorship I have received from the legal team and look forward to supporting PennFuture&rsquo;s mission of protecting the Commonwealth&rsquo;s natural resources, promoting sound public policy, and advancing a sustainable clean energy economy.</p>











<p><strong>Henry Pryor, Second-Year Student at Penn State Dickinson Law</strong></p>

<p><img  class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/Henry%2DPryor.png"" style=""width: 225px; height: 338px; float: left;"" />Growing up in Southern California, environmental issues are everywhere. Widespread smog, droughts, and wildfires all plague the Los Angeles basin regularly. Spending many weekends and every summer outdoors, I knew I wanted my career to be spent fighting to protect our natural world. </p>

<p>In college, I majored in Environmental Thought and Practice, which deepened my interest in environmental issues, particularly the legal and policy aspects that affect our natural world. At Penn State Dickinson Law, I serve as president of the Environmental Law Society, and I hope that in this role, I can encourage more students to pursue the critical field of environmental law.</p>

<p>This fall, I am thrilled to be part of the team at PennFuture, where I can contribute to advancing environmental policy and protecting communities and natural spaces in my new home state of Pennsylvania.</p>

PennFuture Commends Pocono Municipalities for Preparing for Data Centers,8/28/2025,"<p>This summer has brought a flurry of activity from municipalities across the Poconos as they adopt new zoning ordinances to prepare for potential data center development. You can learn more about data centers <a href=""/datacenters"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Poconos&rsquo; recent experience with rapid warehouse/distribution center growth has taught the region the importance of getting zoning ordinances on the books to address this next wave of highly-impactful development. Ordinances give municipalities the power to control where data center development occurs and under what conditions. Without them, municipalities lose this control. That is especially true in Pennsylvania because our Supreme Court has held that the Pennsylvania constitution requires every municipality to allow for every legitimate land use somewhere within its borders. This means municipalities do not have the option of saying &ldquo;no thank you&rdquo; to data centers, and a municipality that fails to address data centers in its zoning ordinance runs the risk of a data center developer bringing a legal challenge against the ordinance. If the developer wins that challenge, they must be allowed to develop wherever they please. Municipalities whose ordinances do not allow for data centers remain vulnerable to these challenges up to the moment they formally announce their intention to adopt an ordinance to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; the exclusion.</p>

<p>One township that learned this the hard way is Clifton Township, Lackawanna County. This spring, the township learned of a developer&rsquo;s desire to build a 17-building data center campus on approximately 500 acres in the township, along with another 500 acres in neighboring Covington Township. Much of this property is located in a residential zoning district, and nearly all of it contains uncut forest and Exceptional Value streams and wetlands. Clifton Township&rsquo;s existing zoning ordinance did not address data centers, so the township quickly drafted an amendment that would limit data centers to its Industrial District and impose commonsense restrictions on them. However, mere hours before the township publicly announced its intention to adopt this ordinance, the data center developer submitted a legal challenge to the existing ordinance. By doing so, the developer &ldquo;beat the clock,&rdquo; and Clifton Township now must defend against the challenge. If it loses, it must allow the data center developer to build in the residential zone, regardless of what the new ordinance says.</p>

<p>Clifton Township&rsquo;s experience can serve as a warning to all Pennsylvania municipalities&mdash;do not wait until a developer is at your door to update your zoning ordinance. Decide NOW how your municipality should regulate these uses if and when they come knocking. PennFuture commends the municipalities in the Poconos that have done just that, including Coolbaugh, Jackson, Chestnuthill, Polk, Clifton, and Covington Townships, and other townships like Kidder, Tobyhanna, and Smithfield that are quickly working toward doing the same.</p>

<p>As several of these municipalities have acknowledged, their first efforts at data center regulation may not be perfect. Data centers are new uses for most Pennsylvania municipalities, and technological innovations are occurring at a rapid pace. It is very likely that the ordinances adopted this summer will need to be revised and amended in the future as we learn more about how this development will take shape in Pennsylvania. But, municipalities should not let the perfect become the enemy of the good. An imperfect ordinance is better than no ordinance at all!</p>

<p>And municipalities do not have to go at it alone! PennFuture is here to help! Our <a href=""/Files/Admin/Model%2DData%2DCenter%2DOrdinance%281%29.pdf"">model data center ordinance</a> and<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdnx39zyNTg""> video series</a> can help municipalities get up to speed and take action quickly to ensure data center growth is appropriately regulated. We&rsquo;ve done the leg work necessary to produce a thorough and considerate ordinance, reviewing ordinances from PA and other states, considering the impacts of this type of land use, and ensuring sufficient local authority over where this new land use should go.

Here Comes the Sun: PennFuture’s Guide to Planning for Grid-Scale Solar Development,7/9/2025,"<p>Grid-scale solar (large, ground-mounted solar arrays, often referred to as solar farms) is the fastest-growing and least expensive form electric generation in the United States. Pennsylvania has increased its solar power generation by 370% over the past decade, and the future undoubtedly holds even more of this clean, renewable power source. In fact, nearly all of the energy generation projects awaiting approval from PJM, the organization that controls which energy generators can connect to the grid, are grid-scale solar projects.</p>

<p>As the level of government tasked with the job of choosing good locations for all types of land development, municipalities have an important role in ushering in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s bright new energy future. However, many municipalities are considering grid-scale solar for the first time and are in need of information about this type of development in order to make good siting decisions.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why PennFuture created <em>Here Comes the Sun: A Municipal Guide to Grid-Scale Solar Siting</em>. This isn&rsquo;t another model ordinance. Many model ordinances for solar already exist. Instead, this publication aims to give municipalities the background and tools they need to evaluate potential ordinance provisions, learn the truth behind common objections to solar, and appropriately plan for grid-scale solar development.</p>

<p><em>Here Comes the Sun</em> is a comprehensive guide that covers a number of topics of interest to municipalities planning for solar.<br />
These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is grid-scale solar?</li>
	<li>Parts of a grid-scale solar system</li>
	<li>What makes a good site for grid-scale solar</li>
	<li>Tips for improving the legal landscape for grid-scale solar, including analysis of common solar ordinance provisions</li>
	<li>The reality of solar on brownfields, warehouse roofs, and parking lots</li>
	<li>Objections based on grid-scale solar&rsquo;s lack of direct connection to local energy consumers</li>
	<li>The truth behind common myths about grid-scale solar.</li>

A summer at PennFuture gives me the chance to explore this field in a way that is both rewarding and impactful.</p> <hr /> <p><strong><img class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/JosefIntern.jpg"" style=""width: 300px; height: 302px; float: left;"" />Josef Novacek, Rising Second-Year Student at Catholic University Columbus School of Law</strong><br /> As a native Pennsylvanian who grew up near the decommissioned Three Mile Island, I understand the importance of balancing economic productivity with environmental protection. I did not begin law school intending to focus on environmental or energy law, but I’ve come to see how these fields can have a direct and positive impact on my community by promoting a cleaner, safer, and more reliable future.</p> <p>I’m excited to contribute to PennFuture’s mission by learning from its experienced legal team and helping navigate the rapidly evolving environmental and energy landscape. By understanding and responding to shifting regulations, we can help ensure that Pennsylvania’s environment and communities continue to thrive.</p> <p>At the Columbus School of Law, I serve as Treasurer of both the First Generation Law Student Union and the Law and Technology Student Association. I’m particularly interested in how emerging technologies can be leveraged to protect and improve our environment.</p>",,"Abigail M. Jones, Vice President of Legal and Policy"
Introducing PennFuture’s New Spring Term Legal Intern!,2/18/2025,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania’s environment and “create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.”</p><p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p><p>As PennFuture looks ahead to the next 20 years, we recognize the importance of cultivating the next generation of advocates who will continue to support our mission. Our staff has a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire future environmental leaders.</p><p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment.</p><p>The goal of this program is to build a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the many challenges impacting Pennsylvania, while also supporting their long-term environmental careers. We have already seen success, as many of our legal interns have gone on to work in Pennsylvania’s environmental legal community. We also hope that offering funded internships will help bring greater diversity and inclusivity into the nonprofit environmental advocacy sphere.</p><p>Over the past four years, our interns have made it possible for PennFuture’s legal team to do more, faster, and better. They have supported our litigation efforts against water polluters and fracked-gas facilities, drafted comments in support of stronger regulatory protections across the Commonwealth, and helped our attorneys strategize and execute impactful legal actions. We are grateful for their hard work, passion, and dedication.</p><p>This spring, we are thrilled to welcome a fantastic student who brings a unique background and experience to our mission. We asked our new intern to explain, in her own words, what environmental law and PennFuture’s mission mean to her.</p><p><img class=""align-left"" src=""/Files/Admin/HeadshotAyahManalastas_24_4x6.jpg"" alt=""Ayah Manalastas""><strong>Ayah Manalastas, Second-Year Student at Penn State Dickinson Law</strong><br>My childhood experiences with frequent power outages in the Philippines sparked my interest in energy and environmental law. The paradox of unreliable electricity and high costs, caused by aging infrastructure, natural disasters, and growing demand, fueled my curiosity. These early challenges inspired my passion for addressing complex issues at the intersection of energy policy and environmental protection.</p><p>Prior to law school, I worked as a paralegal for several years at one of the nation’s leading energy law firms. That role gave me a deeper understanding of the federal energy landscape and provided invaluable insight into the electric, gas, and oil industries through assisting in sophisticated regulatory matters. As an aspiring litigator, I am eager to apply this practical knowledge to PennFuture’s impactful work in creating a more sustainable future for Pennsylvania. I also look forward to learning more about environmental advocacy and policymaking to advance clean energy solutions.</p><p>At Penn State Dickinson Law, I am actively involved in my community as President of the Women’s Law Caucus, Secretary of OutLaw, a member of the Moot Court team, Legal Analysis and Writing Teaching Assistant for Professor Martin, an Admissions Ambassador, a member of the Student Bar Association Social Committee, and a member of the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association.</p>",Environment,"Abigail M.

Aid to California Wildfire Victims,1/9/2025,"<p>The Palisades fire is one of the most destructive natural disasters in Los Angeles history and fire officials said they expect more lives to be lost as the three fires &mdash; The Palisades fire, Eaton fire and Sunset fire &mdash; continue to spread.</p>

<p>Our hearts go out to the families who have lost loved ones and to everyone affected by the California wildfires and their devastating aftermath.</p>

<p>This unprecedented event in Los Angeles was driven by a unique mix of environmental conditions, creating multiple firestorms. It underscores a new era of complex and compound climate disasters, with impacts felt far beyond the immediately affected areas.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.goerie.com/story/opinion/columns/2024/11/27/pa-wildfires-climate-change-firefighters-dcnr-forestry/76597032007/"">Even here in Pennsylvania, climate change is extending our fire danger season.</a> Drought conditions, unseasonably warm temperatures, and autumn&rsquo;s fallen leaves create the perfect storm for fires to ignite and spread. Over the past two years, wildfires have occurred as early as February and as late as November, highlighting the urgent need for year-round vigilance.</p>

<p>Climate change and extreme weather pose challenges that affect everyone. During these difficult times, its important to support one another.</p>
