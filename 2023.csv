Mapping Climate Change By Viewing USDA's Plant Hardiness Zones,12/1/2023,"<div>This month, the USDA released the first update to its <a href=""https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/"">Plant Hardiness Zone Map</a> in more than a decade, providing a stark, full-color depiction of the progress of climate change.</div><div>The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map divides the country into thirteen hardiness zones based on the annual extreme minimum winter temperature at each location. The extreme minimum winter temperature reflects the average of the coldest temperature reached in a location for each year over a specified time period and provides a reasonable estimate of the lowest temperature one can expect at that location each year. Each hardiness zone covers ten degrees Fahrenheit and is broken into two five-degree half-zones (e.g. zone 5 is divided it half-zones 5a and 5b). <strong>Gardeners and growers use this information to determine which perennial plants are likely to thrive at a location, and the USDA Risk Management Agency uses it to set crop insurance standards. Scientists also use this data to model the spread of exotic weeds and insects.</strong></div><div>The 2023 map is based on the average lowest annual winter temperature for the 30-year period from 1991 to 2020 and incorporates data from more than 13,412 weather stations nationwide. Compared to earlier versions of the map, the 2023 map shows that many hardiness zones have shifted significantly over time. In fact, between 2012 and 2023, about half the country, including much of Pennsylvania, has shifted a half-zone warmer. For example, the 2012 map, based on data from 1976 to 2005, places nearly all of Lancaster County in Zone 6b, with an average extreme minimum winter temperature between -5 °F and 0 °F . <strong>The new 2023 map shows that the average extreme minimum winter temperature in Lancaster County is now five degrees warmer, placing the county in Zone 7a. Harrisburg, Erie, Scranton, Reading, the Poconos, and much of southwest PA similarly have shifted a half-zone warmer from their 2012 zones.</strong></div><div><img src=""/Files/Admin/Plant1.jpg"" /></div><div><img src=""/Files/Admin/Plant3.jpg"" /></div><div>Comparing the 2023 map to the 1990 map, which is based on data from 1974 to 1986, (link here: <a href=""https://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-pennsylvania-usda-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php"">Pennsylvania Interactive 1990 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map</a>)shows an even more dramatic shift. In 1990, approximately half the Commonwealth fell into Zones 4b or 5, with average extreme minimum temperature ranging from -25 °F to -10 °F. Now, only a small portion of the northernmost counties remains in Zone 5b, and no part of the Commonwealth remains in Zone 5a or 4b. This means not only that the coldest temperature one can expect to experience anywhere in Pennsylvania is now ten degrees warmer than it was in 1990, but that the portion of the Commonwealth that will experience these cold temperatures is severely reduced.</div><div>While home gardeners may welcome the extended growing season that comes with warmer weather,<strong> this data signals trouble for some native plants. </strong>A number of native plant species such as balsam fir, and bog laurel and creeping snowberry are already at the far southern fringe of their remaining habitat in Pennsylvania. Research by the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program has designated these and more than a dozen other native plant species as ""extremely vulnerable"" to warming temperatures. Many of these species, including the white-fringed orchid, the leafy bog aster, bog rosemary, and Labrador tea grow only in bog or wetland habitats that are highly vulnerable to loss or reduction with climate changes.. </div><div>Warmer temperatures also allow invasive insect species that prey on native plants to thrive. For example, the emerald ash borer is an invasive insect that poses a serious threat to the 308 million ash trees in Pennsylvania forests. Cold temperatures help reduce the number of emerald ash borer larvae that survive the winter, but significant larvae die off does not occur until temperatures fall to -10 °F. The 2023 Plant Hardiness Zones Map indicates that the portion of Pennsylvania that can expect to experience temperatures this low has shrunk dramatically since 2012.</div><div>Similarly, low winter temperature has a dynamic role in impacting the range and population of the hemlock woolly adelgid, an invasive insect that has infected, weakened, and killed an enormous number of the Pennsylvania state tree, the eastern hemlock. The destruction of hemlocks by this pest has greatly affected Pennsylvania's forest habitats and streams by reducing shelter for wildlife and warming unshaded streams. This, in turn, threatens aquatic species that depend on cooler water such as brook trout, rainbow trout, and the eastern hellbender. Like the emerald ash borer, hemlock woolly adelgids can survive subfreezing temperatures, but their survival rate drops off significantly once temperatures dip below zero, and most will die when temperatures reach -10 °F. As the map below illustrates, as fewer locations experience the extreme cold necessary to keep the population in check, the woolly adelgid's range creeps ever northward, threatening more of these beautiful emblems of Pennsylvania's natural beauty and diversity.</div><div><img src=""/Files/Admin/Plant2.jpg"" /></div><div>The threat posed to our native plant species and the ecosystems they support is just one of the reasons that PennFuture is committed to combating and mitigating the impacts of the climate crisis by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, building resilient communities, and forging a just and equitable clean energy economy in Pennsylvania.

Climate Disruption on Trial: A Major Victory for Environmental Rights in Montana,11/15/2023,"<p>On August 14, 2023, a Montana state trial court decided that the legislature violated the peoples constitutional right to a ""clean and healthful environment"" by exempting climate change from the standard environmental review to which major projects are subject. It did so after a week-long trial in which the state made no serious effort to challenge the scientific validity of human-caused climate disruption. </p><p>While many climate cases are pending, Held v. Montana is the first constitutional climate decision in the U.S. based on a trial-and climate disruption lost.</p><p>The story is not over because Montanas attorney general has appealed the decision to the states supreme court. But that court has already held that two other legislative exemptions to environmental laws violate the right to a ""clean and healthful environment."" <br /></p><h3><strong>Background On Held v. Montana</strong></h3><p>The case began in March 2020 when 16 Montana youth filed suit. Since 1971, the Montana Environmental Policy Act has required the state to assess the environmental impact of proposed major state actions that may significantly affect the environment. More recently, the legislature adopted an exemption to that act. As the trial court explained, the exemption ""bars agencies from considering [greenhouse gas] emissions and climate impacts for any project or proposal, even to assess whether the project complies with the Montana Constitution."" <br /><br /> In its decision, the trial court made detailed findings of fact about:</p><ul><li>The impact of climate change on Montanas environment</li><li>The harm climate change is causing plaintiffs</li><li>How defendants actions contribute to both climate change and harm to the plaintiffs</li><li>How the MEPA exemption contributes to that harm and prevents full review of technologically and economically available alternatives to fossil fuels in Montana </li></ul><h3><strong>A Constitutional Right to a ""Clean and Healthful Environment""</strong></h3><p>The court held that the plaintiffs ""have a fundamental constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, which includes climate as part of the environmental life-support system."" </p><p>The exemption infringes on that right, the court held, and thus is subject to strict scrutiny. Under Montana constitutional law, a law (like this exemption) that infringes on a fundamental right can still be constitutional if it survives strict scrutiny review. To do so, the law must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.</p><p>The state did not provide any evidence on this issue. Therefore, the trial court held the exemption to be unconstitutional and enjoined the state from acting in accordance with it.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Montana%2D%281%29.jpg"" /></p><h3><strong>Previous Cases</strong></h3><p>On the merits, the attorney generals appeal must address prior Montana Supreme Court decisions that appear to weigh strongly against the state. </p><p>In Montana Environmental Information Center v. Department of Environmental Quality (1999), the state legislature exempted arsenic discharges from groundwater pumping tests from review under the states water quality nondegradation statute. The plaintiffs claimed the exemption violated their right to a ""clean and healthful environment.""</p><p>They demonstrated that the tests would increase the concentration of arsenic in the receiving water above the concentration that would have required review under the nondegradation statute. The exemption, the states Supreme Court held, thus intrudes on the plaintiffs right to a ""clean and healthful environment."" </p><p>In a later case, Park County Environmental Council v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality (2020), the Montana Supreme Court held that a legislative exemption to MEPA violated the right to a"" clean and healthful environment."" The amendment barred courts from issuing injunctions to prevent violations of MEPA.</p><p>In this case, the Department of Environmental Quality approved an exploration permit for mining in the Yellowstone River watershed 15 miles from Yellowstone National Park. However, its MEPA analysis did not adequately analyze wildlife and water quality effects. Under the statutory amendment, the company would have been able to continue conducting exploration activities while the MEPA defects were being corrected.</p><p>The court held the amendment unconstitutional on its face, using strict scrutiny analysis, because it removed ""the Plaintiffs only available remedy adequate to prevent potential constitutionally-proscribed environmental harms.""</p><h3><strong>A Supreme Court Victory Wont Stop Fossil Fuel Project Approvals</strong></h3><p>MEPA requires environmental impacts to be considered before a decision. But if the state considers these impacts, MEPA does not stop the state from approving a fossil fuel project that will be environmentally damaging. So even if the plaintiffs win on appeal, coal mines, gas wells, and oil and gas pipelines may continue to be approved.</p><p>However, the state would be required to provide public information about the climate change impacts of these projects and alternatives to them. This information is likely to have some negative effect on these projects. Otherwise, the legislature would not likely have passed the exemption. </p><h3><img src=""/Files/Admin/Montana%2D%282%29.jpg"" /><br /></h3><h3><strong>How the Montana Case Relates to Pennsylvania</strong></h3><p>Pennsylvania's constitution (Article I, Section 27) recognizes that the people have a right to ""clean air, pure water,"" and the preservation of certain environmental values. This is similar to the right to a ""clean and healthful environment"" in Montana. Article I, Section 27 also requires the Commonwealth to ""conserve and maintain"" public natural resources for the benefit of present and future generations. There is nothing like that in Montana's constitution.</p><p>Pennsylvania has no statute like MEPA. Still, Article I, Section 27 could be an effective tool to address climate change. Robert McKinstry, an environmental attorney, and I have argued that in an article. <br /><br /> In a recent case, petitioners challenged a PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) regulation that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from major power plants. They allege that this regulation, which would enable Pennsylvania to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), was not authorized by the states Air Pollution Control Act. The Commonwealth Court agreed with them and issued a preliminary injunction against the regulation in 2022. </p><p>On appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme court, the Widener Commonwealth Environmental Law and Sustainability Center and Robert McKinstry, as well as PennFuture, supported the regulation. In separate friend-of-the-court briefs, we argued that DEP has statutory authority and that Article I, Section 27 supports the states authority to adopt this regulation. A decision on that appeal is pending.</p><p>On November 1, the Commonwealth Court issued a permanent injunction against the RGGI regulation. Governor Josh Shapiro has 30 days to appeal that decision to the PA Supreme Court.</p><p>Constitutional provisions like those in Montana and Pennsylvania are not silver bullets for fighting climate change. But they can play an essential role in the effort. </p>",Climate; Energy; Environment,"John Dernbach, Board member"
PennFuture Appeals Zoning Approval of Commercial Development in EV Watershed,10/27/2023,"<p>Yesterday, PennFuture <a href=""/Files/Admin/2023.10.26---Notice-of-Land-Use-Appeal.pdf"">filed a notice of land use appeal </a>in the Monroe County Court of Common Pleas challenging the decision of the Paradise Township Board of Supervisors granting conditional use approval for a resort and shopping center on the banks of two Exceptional Value (EV) streams.</p><p>In short, while we support the development of a resort that actually considers and attempts to minimize its impacts on the surrounding environment, community, and EV waters, we filed this appeal to hold the Township accountable to its own zoning ordinances and the law. <a href=""/Blog-Item-Logistics-Facilities-are-Coming-Is-Your-Municipality-Ready-PennFuture-Releases-Model-Logistics-Use-Ordinance-and-Guidebook"">Having proactive and thoughtful zoning on the books</a> is one of the most important things municipalities can do to protect us from unreasonable impacts, but those zoning ordinances are only useful if the municipality actually applies them and holds developers accountable to the requirements therein.</p><h3><strong>Background - Paradise Township's Resort Development Overlay District</strong></h3><p>In August 2022, New York-based developer JSPA Realty, LLC submitted a zoning application to Paradise Township, Monroe County. The developer seeks to build a resort and shopping center on a 240-acre parcel along the banks of Indian Run and Swiftwater Creek, two of the Poconos' Exceptional Value streams. The property is located in Paradise Township's Resort Development Area Overlay District, a special zoning district that permits resorts to be combined with a variety of other types of uses such as shopping centers to create integrated developments called ""Master Developments.""</p><p>The overlay district is a well-crafted ordinance that facilitates development that diversifies the Township's economy and enhances the tourism industry that has attracted people to the Poconos for over 100 years while also conserving existing stream water quality and other natural features. To accomplish this balance between economic development and protection of the environment and the surrounding community, the zoning ordinance requires the various uses within Master Developments to be ""integrated"" with one another and to meet a variety of other requirements.</p><p>Master Developments like the one proposed by the developer are conditional uses in the Resort Development Overlay District. This means that the Township Board of Supervisors must hold a hearing to decide if the development can be approved. This is an important stage of the land use approval process where the developer must ""show its work"" and demonstrate how its proposal satisfies all the applicable requirements of the zoning ordinance. A developer who does not demonstrate at the hearing how they will go about satisfying the zoning ordinance requirements is not entitled to approval. </p><h3><strong>Township Approved the Proposal Despite Lack of Integration Between Resort and Shopping Center</strong></h3><p>PennFuture participated in nine hearings on the proposed development. Based on the evidence presented at these hearings, we concluded that the resort is the type of thoughtful, well-designed development that PennFuture supports in the Poconos. The developer's plans and testimony show a project that respects the natural landscape and the exceptional value waterways by minimizing impervious coverage and shaping development around the existing contours of the land. The developer also proposes stormwater and wastewater treatment facilities that will return water to the ground without discharging it into the nearby streams. While we will continue to watchdog the DEP permitting of the project to ensure protection of the EV streams, we believe the resort as proposed will allow visitors to experience the natural beauty of the area, as visitors to the Poconos have for decades, without unduly harming it. </p><p>The shopping center is another story. In order to be allowed in the district, the shopping center must be integrated with the resort as one ""Master Development."" After hearing all the evidence, we concluded that the resort and shopping center were not ""integrated"" as required. The Paradise Township Board of Supervisors agreed and found that the developer failed to show how it would comply with this and various other requirements of the zoning ordinance.</p><p>This should have been the end of the story, and the conditional use application should have been denied for these reasons. However, the Board approved the application anyway, believing that the developer could make up for the shortcomings later by complying with certain conditions the Board placed on the approval.</p><h3><strong>Municipalities Must Require Developers to Show Their Work Before Development is Approved</strong></h3><p>This is why PennFuture appealed the decision. Pennsylvania law is clear: A developer must show how its proposal will comply with the zoning ordinance at the time the application is submitted. This is why conditional use hearings exist-for a developer to demonstrate to the municipality and the public precisely how it will meet the ordinance requirements. A township cannot approve an application based on a developer's promise to ""work things out"" in the future.</p><p>It is vital that municipalities follow the rules that govern the land use approval process, especially in our special protection watersheds and other sensitive environmental areas. Paradise Township has taken an important first step by enacting an ordinance that appropriately balances protection of the natural environment and the economic needs of the community. However, good ordinances are ineffective if municipalities do not take the next step and ensure that developers follow them. We know that protecting our Exceptional Value waters means municipalities must require developers to ""show their work"" before those municipalities approve development, and we will do our best to watchdog local municipalities and hold them accountable should they compromise the health of our environment and communities by failing to follow their own local zoning. </p><p>Support our work protecting local streams and communities by becoming a <a href=""/donate"">PennFuture member</a> today!</p>",Environment,"Brigitte Meyer, Staff Attorney"
How RGGI Can Help PA Meet EPA’s New Carbon Emission Reduction Standards,10/24/2023,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) solicited comments on a proposed rule that will limit the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that can be released by new and modified fossil-fuel power plants.When the comment period closed on August 8, 2023, over 1.1 million comments had been submitted. According to the EPA, power plants account for at least 25 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere, which is nearly twice as much as homes and small business contributions combined. </p><p>In its proposed rule, the EPA found that a technology called carbon capture and storage (CCS) could be used to achieve a 90 percent capture of GHG emissions.CCS involves the capture of carbon emissions from power plants and storing them underground or in the ocean.There are many concerns involved in the use of CCS.The technology is not widely used and will be more expensive for power plants to install than clean energy alternatives such as solar generation.More information about carbon capture and the EPA's proposed carbon rule can be found here. </p><p>Although the EPA has designated CCS as the best system of emission reduction (BSER), this does not mean it is the only method states can use to achieve 90 percent emission reduction. States are not required to ""compel regulated sources to adopt the particular components of the BSER itself,"" which means states are not required to use CCS to achieve the EPA's emission guidelines.The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is one potential cost-effective method of reaching the EPA's target. </p><h3><strong>What is RGGI?</strong></h3><p>Thirteen regional states currently use RGGI to reduce GHG emissions and control the amount of pollution released by power plants.RGGIis a cap-and-trade program that limits the amount of GHG emissions power plants can release.The program was started in 2005 with seven member states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont.Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Maryland joined two years later in 2007 and Virginia joined RGGI in 2020.RGGI has successfully reduced GHG emissions in these states by more than 50 percent.</p><h3><strong>How does RGGI work?</strong></h3><p>RGGI allows participating states to establish a regional cap on carbon dioxide emissions and each state creates allowances based on its share of the regional cap.Power plants with at least one generator with a capacity of 25 MW are required to purchase allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions at quarterly auctions.Each allowance enables the power plant to emit one ton of carbon dioxide.These auctions also allow states to track emission levels from individual power plants and ensure that they are paying for the emissions they create. </p><p>RGGI allows the competitive market to standardize the cost of each allowance power plants purchase.Allowances are distributed to power plants from the highest bidder to the lowest bidder.Once all the allowances are allocated, each power plant pays the same amount for their allowances which is based on the lowest bid from the auction.RGGI rules include safeguards at these auctions to ensure that allowance prices fall within a designated price range to provide market stability. </p><p>RGGI operates in three-year cycles.To remain compliant under RGGI, power plants must purchase enough allowances to cover fifty percent of their emissions for the first two years in a cycle. Additional allowances are purchased during quarterly auctions or in limited cases from the secondary market.Power plants can roll over any unused allowances and use them during a three-year cycle.In the third year, known as the control period, power plants must surrender all their remaining allowances, including any unused allowances from years one and two.The control period in RGGI creates an incentive for power plants to purchase fewer allowances to prevent surrendering them at the end of the three-year period, and in turn, encourages them to reduce their carbon emissions. </p><p>RGGI creates benefits beyond carbon dioxide reduction.The revenue generated from quarterly auctions is invested back into the community through ""energy efficiency, renewable energy, direct energy bill assistance, and other greenhouse gas reduction programs.""RGGI generated $374 million in 2021 alone, with 51 percent of the investment focused on energy efficiency. States that participate in RGGI are experiencing a double benefit from the program; a reduction in GHG emissions and a revenue source to fund programs to improve their energy sectors.</p><h3><strong>What About Pennsylvania?</strong></h3><p>On April 23, 2022, Pennsylvania published its CO2 Budget Trading Program allowing the State to participate in the RGGI market.This signaled a commitment from Pennsylvania that it was taking ownership of its responsibility to reduce GHG emissions and address its contribution to climate change.Unfortunately, the polluters from the coal industry and their allies in the legislature challenged the rule and brought an action in State court requesting that the law be declared unconstitutional.As a result of a last-minute injunction, Pennsylvania was forced to pull its allowances from the September 2022 auction and cannot participate in the RGGI auctions until the injunction is lifted or the case is resolved. </p><p>Pennsylvania's withdrawal from RGGI has been a blow to the State's commitment to fight climate change but has also had financial repercussions.Over a billion dollars in energy investment funds may have been lost while Pennsylvania awaits a court decision on the constitutionality of RGGI.Participating RGGI states have prevented the release of 4.4 million tons of carbon dioxide, which also creates a reduction in other pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, and particulate matter.Citizens of these states have directly benefited from the $1.2 billion in lifetime energy bill savings.While other states are reaping the rewards of RGGI participation, Pennsylvania is being left behind.The absence of state regulation allows power plants in Pennsylvania to continue to pollute the air we breathe without any accountability and without paying a cent. </p><h3><strong>RGGI is Right for Pennsylvania?</strong></h3><p>Citizens across the State of Pennsylvania are feeling the effects of power plant pollution and paying the price with their health.The Shenango Coke Plant was closed on Neville Island near Pittsburgh in 2016.Coking plants are fueled by coke derived from coal and emit similar pollutants to power plants.A recent study conducted by New York University has shown that the plant's closure created a 90 percent decrease in sulfur pollution and local residents experienced an immediate 42 percent reduction in emergency room visits.Those visits further declined by 62 percent after the plant was closed for three years.It's anticipated that additional health benefits including a decrease in asthma cases and cardiovascular disease, will be realized as more time passes since the plant's closure.With both coking and power plants scattered across the State, even a reduction in pollution emissions from these plants could vastly improve the health of Pennsylvania's citizens.RGGI could create these reductions with the added benefit of generating investment funds for Pennsylvania's clean energy infrastructure.</p><p>In just a few short weeks, the September RGGI auction will take place without Pennsylvania's participation. Power plants in Pennsylvania will continue to emit harmful pollutants into our air and advance the climate change disaster that is being felt across the world.RGGI could not only provide a solution to this problem but would make it possible for Pennsylvania to comply with the 90 percent carbon emission reduction included in the EPA's proposed carbon rule. </p><p>We can only hope the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will uphold RGGI and the State can participate in the December 2023 auction, although it is unlikely the case will be resolved in time. Pennsylvanians deserve to reap the benefits enjoyed by other participating RGGI states in our region.Power plants need to be held responsible for the harmful emissions they release into the air we breathe.The State could utilize RGGI to create accountability and force power plants to reduce their GHG emissions, which would improve the health and quality of life for all Pennsylvanians. </p>",Climate; Energy,Lindsay Williamson
"Riparian Buffers: a Natural, Inexpensive, and Crucial Way to Protect and Improve Water Quality",10/18/2023,"<h3><strong>What are riparian buffers?</strong></h3><p><br /> Riparian buffers are the areas of undeveloped land surrounding bodies of water that contain trees, shrubs, and other plants. Riparian buffers protect water quality and create wildlife habitat along creeks, streams, rivers, and wetlands. They offer valuable ecosystem services to nearby human communities, and they act as both an economic driver and financial saver for these communities.<br /> Riparian buffers serve many roles. They provide habitat for wildlife and maintain cool water temperatures to support aquatic life, like trout. They act as sponges, soaking up stormwater runoff, which reduces the occurrence and impact of flooding. They also act as filters by purifying that stormwater, removing contaminants like road salt and vehicle fluids that can get carried into waterways during heavy rainfall events.</p><h3><strong>Benefits of riparian buffers to PA's waters and communities</strong></h3><p><br /> Pennsylvanias waterways are under threat. <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/CleanWater/WaterQuality/IntegratedWatersReport/Pages/2022-Integrated-Water-Quality-Report.aspx"">More than 30% of Pennsylvanias 86,000 stream miles are so polluted that the DEP considers them ""impaired""</a> - meaning that they are too polluted to meet the standards set for them. This includes rivers like the Lehigh, which was named one of the nation's ""Most Endangered Rivers"" in April 2023. Whats more, only 2% of Pennsylvanias stream miles are clean enough to be designated as Exceptional Value, having the best and most protected water quality in the state.</p><p>Stormwater runoff is the major source of water pollution across the state. Stormwater carries with it pollution such as sediment, nutrients, and even toxic chemicals. This is especially true where chemicals such as fertilizers or manure are inappropriately applied to the land. Moreover, large areas of impervious surfaces - like parking lots and roofs of industrial buildings - shed stormwater quickly, increasing the likelihood of flooding. If not properly managed, stormwater harms our waters by increasing both the type and amount of pollutants that enter the Commonwealth's waters.</p><p>In addition to the environmental and ecological benefits described above, riparian buffers provide a wide range of ecosystem services, which benefit surrounding human communities. These services include:</p><ul><li>Capturing and storing carbon in vegetation and soils, which helps regulate the climate and clean the air.</li><li>Mitigating the negative effects of land use, including commercial or industrial development.</li><li>Reducing the cost of and stress on water treatment infrastructure by trapping sediment and pollutants before they reach the water.</li><li>Decreasing soil erosion - the roots of vegetation hold soil in place, even during extreme weather events and flooding.</li></ul><p>These ecosystem services translate into real monetary value. Riparian buffers in the Delaware River Basin, alone, provide about $11,000 per acre in services each year. The social cost of carbon is approximately $50 per metric ton, so Pennsylvania's 219 million metric tons of CO2 of annual emissions contribute to $10.95 billion in damages every year. However, one million acres of riparian buffer around the state could offset around 70% of that figure, even without considering the other ecosystem service benefits. Case in point, riparian buffers provide up to $9,409 of carbon storage benefits per acre per year in the Delaware River Basin. Additionally, according to regional case studies, watershed conservation in New York was at least $6.5 billion cheaper than a new filtration plant; and, in the Chesapeake Bay, each pound of nitrogen abatement was nearly one-third cheaper when done by forest buffers instead of treatment plants.</p><h3><strong>We need to do more to protect riparian buffers from destruction and development.</strong></h3><p>And we know that Pennsylvanians support this. Last spring, the Our Pocono Waters campaign commissioned <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.wordpress.com/2022/05/11/pocono-residents-support-more-action-to-protect-exceptional-value-streams-new-poll-finds/"">a survey</a> of community members in the headwaters of the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers. The results were overwhelming - 94% of residents in the Poconos want their state and local officials to do more to protect and preserve their waterways. And we see similar sentiments from communities throughout the Commonwealth, especially in relation to increased flooding and other climate impacts.</p><p>We know that downstream communities experience the cumulative impacts of upstream land uses, including increased, large-scale development. Protecting riparian buffers across watersheds can help mitigate some of those impacts, like flooding and degraded water quality, and can help some of our most sensitive communities from bearing the brunt of this pollution.</p><p>Over the years, PennFuture has prioritized stormwater management and has championed riparian buffers and other ways to protect our waters from stormwater pollution and our communities from flooding. In 2017, we drafted a <a href=""/Files/Admin/PennFuture_StormwaterManual_web_3.20.17.pdf"">Stormwater Ordinance Manual</a> which guides communities to better safeguard water sources. In 2022, PennFuture was <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Protects-Major-River-Basins-Across-Pennsylvania-in-Stormwater-Settlement"">successful in its litigation</a> against PA DEP, Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, resulting in stronger protections from stormwater runoff in our major river basins. More recently, PennFuture successfully nominated the Lehigh River for <a href=""https://mostendangeredrivers.org/river/lehigh-river/"">American Rivers Most Endangered Rivers List of 2023</a>, and supported the publication of Our Pocono Waters <a href=""/Files/Admin/OurPoconoWaters_Report_FINAL_WEB-PDF_8.8.22-%28reduced%29.pdf"">""Economic Effects of Special Protection Stream Designations in the Pocono Mountains Region"".</a></p><p>Currently, we are actively supporting the passage of the Riparian Buffer Protection Act <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2023&sInd=0&body=H&type=B&bn=1275"">(HB 1275)</a>. This piece of legislation aims to safeguard Pennsylvanias pristine waterways and to invest in the health of the impaired streams impacting our communities by establishing riparian buffers for all the Commonwealths' waterways. Laws like this help Pennsylvania ""protect the pristine and invest in the impaired.""</p><h3><strong>Riparian buffers and property rights</strong></h3><p>In response to bills like the Riparian Buffer Protection Act or local ordinances that establish riparian buffers, opponents of these natural and cost effective solutions to pollution argue that creating or increasing riparian buffers will be a ""takings."" This argument, however, is without merit.</p><p>Takings are an exercise of governmental authority in restricting a property owner's use of his property. Taking of private property for public use is allowed by the government, but if it goes too far, then the property owner must receive ""just compensation"" for his loss of property. There is much case law and legal standards that apply to help determine when a restriction on the use of property through regulatory actions is a taking. In short, it's a balancing act and, on balance, riparian buffers statutes and ordinances are not a takings.</p><p>Regulations that prevent harm to the public or protect a public interest in quality of life and the environment, such as riparian ordinances, are traditionally considered legitimate exercises of the police power that do not constitute a taking. Additionally, many of these regulations, including the Riparian Buffer Protection Act, include exceptions for much of the work that small landowners and even developers may do on their property that could impact the riparian buffer area.</p><p>Riparian buffers are an essential way for Pennsylvania to protect and improve water quality and protect landowners and communities from increased flooding across the state while also respecting the rights of property owners. This is why PennFuture supports actions, conservation measures, and legislation that establishes and protects riparian buffers in Pennsylvania.</p><h3><strong>How can you help protect water quality and riparian buffers</strong></h3><p>Check out PennFuture's <a href=""/policy-briefs"">Riparian Buffer Policy Brief</a>.</p><p>Learn more about how irresponsible development threatens riparian buffers and water quality in the Lehigh River watershed by watching this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOg9C_ybIp0"">short video</a>.</p><p><a href=""https://act.americanrivers.org/page/50773/action/1?ea.tracking.id=MERms"">Sign and share this petition</a> telling state lawmakers to support HB1275 - the Riparian Buffer Protection Act.</p><p>Support PennFuture's efforts to protect the quality of our waters and protect our communities from pollution and flooding by<a href=""/donate""> becoming a member today</a>!</p>",Environment,"Abigail M.

Renaming Erie’s “Summer of Soot and Sewage” to the Summer of Community Climate Solutions,9/22/2023,"<p>Last week, an article in the Erie Times-News aptly referred to Erie's summer as the ""Summer of Soot and Sewage.""</p><p>Citing poor air quality resulting from widespread Canadian wildfires and numerous beach closures linked to elevated E. coli levels, reporter David Bruce described a ""double whammy of pollution."" More research is forthcoming to understand the record number of E. coli-related beach closures, as some uncharacteristically did not follow periods of intense rainfall. However, research shows an overarching link between elevated exposure to E. coli bacteria and increased Canadian wildfire burn acreage, both of which are tied to a changing climate. With Erie named the seventh fastest-warming city in the United States and July 2023 becoming the hottest month on record globally, it is clear that Erie is not immune from climate impacts.</p><p>We are facing significant environmental challenges, and research shows we need to take action at all levels and across all sectors to prevent the worst harm. At PennFuture, we advocate to those in positions of power for policy change. However, to succeed in this role, we rely on the efforts and stories of hardworking scientists, government employees, and social justice, environmental, and labor activists, among many others working on the ground.</p><p>Reflecting on Erie's summer, I want to highlight four community activist-led efforts that provide hope and inspiration about our ability to create change. Based on the examples set by these community advocates, I propose we rename this recent season the ""Summer of Community Climate Solutions.""</p><h3><strong>UE Wabtec Strike and the Green Locomotive Project</strong></h3><p>At the beginning of the summer, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute released a report concluding that if Wabtec committed to producing 1,000 green locomotives per year at its Lawrence Park plant, up to 5,100 well-paying jobs could be created in Erie County alone. Our partner, ReImagine Appalachia, elevated the report from the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America and their Green Locomotive Project. UE's Green Locomotive Project aims to create ""good union jobs, address climate change, and clean up pollution in the low-income communities and communities of color which bear the brunt of pollution from rail yards.""</p><p>The Green Locomotive Project became a focal point of contention between UE and Wabtec during a two-month strike involving UE's 1,400-member workforce. PennFuture stood in solidarity with UE Locals 506 and 618 in Pittsburgh and Erie, speaking in support of the Green Locomotive Project at two rallies in Erie.</p><p>I hope the efforts of UE in Erie this summer will serve as a catalyst for more conversations about Erie's position in the rapidly expanding green manufacturing sector and a more sustainable local standard for development.</p><h3><strong>Grow Erie Groundbreaking at Savocchio Opportunity Park</strong></h3><p>Right around the corner from Wabtec, the persistence of East Erie residents is setting another example for climate action. On June 15, Grow Erie, an initiative spearheaded by the Minority Community Investment Corporation, broke ground at Savocchio Opportunity Park after 20 years of planning and persistence.</p><p>The Grow Erie site, a remediated brownfield, will include a new urban agriculture facility made possible through a public-private partnership between the Minority Community Investment Corporation, the Erie County Redevelopment Authority, and Integrated Agriculture Systems. Planned for the site are a commercial aquaponics facility and a community greenhouse. Minority Community Investment Corporation leader Gary Horton shared his vision for Grow Erie to ""invest in our neighborhoods, provide employment opportunities, and bring locally grown food to a food desert.""</p><p>Lisa Thompson Sayers of the Erie Times-News summarized the potential for Grow Erie to serve as a model by concluding a recent column with: ""The nation knows Erie well as a political bellwether. When it comes to resolving some of its most damnable and intractable social, economic and environmental ills, let it be a bellwether of change.""</p><h3><strong>Fairview and Girard Resident Opposition Leads to Defeat of Proposed Agricultural Conversion for Business Park</strong></h3><p>Rural Erie County advocates also claimed victory over the status quo this summer. Erie's history of unencumbered urban sprawl and population decline from its dense community centers has brought significant economic and social costs. Habitat loss, increased automobile travel and emissions, and greater inequity between area school districts and communities are just some of the impacts.</p><p>While many in Erie understand that reinvestment in Erie County's community cores will bring greater benefits and return on investment, polarized politics can get in the way.</p><p>The West County Citizens Coalition showed that the situation is more nuanced at the ground level. A dozen Girard and Fairview Township residents rallied the support of over 1,500 people to fight against converting agricultural land into a business park. Their advocacy cited concerns including insufficient public transparency and resident engagement, increased stormwater runoff, and increased traffic emissions. Their efforts led Erie County Council to rescind approval of the necessary property transfer on August 29. Less than two months after its initial vote, this unanimous decision effectively ended the business park proposal.</p><p>I applaud the concerned citizens of Girard and Fairview Townships for standing up against outdated land use decisions.</p><h3><strong>Hold Erie Coke Accountable Calls for Transparency and a Community Working Group</strong></h3><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Untitled-design-9.jpg"" alt=""Hold Erie Coke Accountable"">The work of Hold Erie Coke Accountable, another group of concerned residents, began in 2019 in response to persistent air and wastewater pollution violations by Erie Coke Corporation. Rather than bringing the plant into environmental compliance, as Hold Erie Coke Accountable advocated, Erie Coke chose to dodge responsibility and shutter the plant without alerting employees.</p><p>Hold Erie Coke Accountable's advocacy continues. The group became increasingly concerned about the lack of effort by area leaders to ensure opportunities for community engagement regarding the future of the site. As a result, the group sent a letter outlining their concerns to nearly 150 Erie regional stakeholders in mid-August.</p><p>One of Hold Erie Coke Accountable's key calls to action is the formation of a Community Working Group, mirroring the precedent set for Tonawanda Coke in Western New York. Hold Erie Coke Accountable continues to meet with stakeholders and leaders to advocate for the creation of this working group.</p><p>The group remains committed to its principles for site reuse aimed at preventing another EPA Title V air permit holder from occupying the site. I appreciate Hold Erie Coke Accountable serving as a watchdog advocating for a future for the site that is informed by the community and free from another emission-belching bad actor.</p><p>A more equitable future for Erie that recognizes the importance of balancing economic prosperity with environmental stewardship will require lessons learned from near and far. This summer has shown that the list of local examples is growing rapidly, and we must build support for leaders who can connect the dots. Thank you again to the community advocates named above, and to others fighting for a better future for the Pennsylvania Lake Erie Watershed and its residents.</p>",Climate,"Jenny Tompkins, Campaign Manager for Clean Water Advocacy"
PennFuture’s Fall 2023 Legal Interns,9/21/2023,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania's environment and ""create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.""</p><p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p><p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognize that we need to be more involved with cultivating the people that will continue to support our mission. Our staff have a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation. </p><p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment. </p><p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting Pennsylvania as well as to further their potential environmental careers. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.</p><p>This fall, we have two fantastic students for our internship, including a returning intern, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We've asked our interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture's mission means to them:</p><h3><strong>Lindsay Williamson, Fourth Year student at Widener University Commonwealth Law School</strong></h3><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Headshot--Lindsay-Williamson.png"" />I completed an internship with PennFuture over the summer and felt the experience was so rewarding that I asked if I could stay through the fall semester. Luckily for me, Abby Jones, Vice President of Legal and Research at PennFuture, agreed. </p><p>I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Connecticut. Despite not having a science background, I knew when I started law school at Widener Commonwealth University that I wanted to work in environmental law after graduation. I am the current president of Widener's Environmental Law and Policy Society. I have also taken several environmental law courses including international environmental law, land use planning, natural resources, environmental law, and animal law. While my time at Widener has provided foundational knowledge, interning at PennFuture has filled in the educational gaps by providing hands-on work experience on current environmental issues affecting Pennsylvania residents. </p><p>Working one-on-one with Rob Altenburg, PennFuture's Director of Energy and Climate, I was able to write a first draft of comments on the Environmental Protection Agency's carbon rule for power plants. I have also reviewed briefs PennFuture is working on in partnership with other environmental advocacy organizations and researched guidance documents and model ordinances for utility-scale solar projects. In addition, I wrote blogs on the Supreme Court's recent Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency decision and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. I have gained insider knowledge on brief writing for Pennsylvania courts and attended meetings with PennFuture staff where creative solutions to combat environmental concerns such as climate change, pollution, and environmental injustice are brought to life. </p><p>PennFuture has encouraged me to continue my education during my internship by allowing me to take part in webinars and training programs. The legal team has been patient, encouraging, and has taken the time to ensure that I understand the projects they are working on and to explain different aspects of practicing environmental law. PennFuture staff are supportive of each other's work and have gone out of their way to make me feel like a valued team member. I have gained so much knowledge during my summer internship and am very grateful for this opportunity. I'm excited to learn even more about environmental advocacy during my fall internship with PennFuture. </p><h3><strong>Isaac Praseedom, Second Year Law Student at Penn State Dickinson Law</strong></h3><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Isaac_Praseedom_17_4x6-61-.jpg"" />Growing up in Cambridge, England, I saw positive steps always taken in my city towards promoting important environmental issues, continually pushing towards building a community where both the current and future generations can be assured that their health and wellbeing is actively considered and focused on as a priority. After moving away and seeing that these sentiments did not permeate in other parts of the world, it became clear that work was needed to help integrate the ideas and policies that I had seen work so effectively in my own home into other places. </p><p>My interest in the law stems from my desire to effect real change into peoples lives. The law affects every aspect of our lives, and for many, is often a source of much heartache and disillusion. To be able to use the law in an effective way that can support those who otherwise would be without a way to get justice in their lives is what is most important to me, and I hope to bring this ideal into practice. </p><p>At Dickinson Law, I am involved in the Student Bar Association, Dickinson Law Review, and the schools Diversity, Inclusion, and Educational Equity Committee. Diversity initiatives are very important to me, so to be able to play a meaningful role in my schools own initiatives is a real honor. </p><p>I am very excited to be at PennFuture this fall and learn more about environmental law and policy, as well as be involved in making a substantial contribution in the fight for the preservation of the environment in Pennsylvania. </p>",Environment,"Abigail M.

The State of Solar Development in PA: Solar Energy Benefits Remain Unrealized,8/10/2023,"<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Citizens/solar/Pages/default.aspx"">PA Department of Environmental Protection</a>, solar energy currently contributes less than 1 percent of the state's total electricity generation. Despite overall <a href=""https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/pennsylvania-solar"">increases across the state</a>, slow solar growth in PA does not align with the rapidly declining costs of installation, <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics"">available tax credits</a>, and the many health benefits of prioritizing solar over fossil fuels. There are more reasons than ever to act quickly to secure Pennsylvanians' economic, environmental, and social wellbeing, all of which would be strengthened by increased deployment of solar energy.</p><p>To clarify why Pennsylvania decision-makers must take urgent action to invest in, expand access to, and amplify the co-benefits of solar energy, PennFuture recently released a <a href=""/Publication-White-Paper-Solar-Energy"">new report on solar energy</a>. This paper sets the record straight on commonly held myths about solar and provides recommendations to overcome the largest obstacles to solar energy adoption.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/White-Paper-Solar-Energy-2.jpg"" alt=""Solar Energy White Paper""></p><h3>Solar Myths and Misconceptions</h3><p>Several myths and misconceptions have led to confusion and concern about the construction of both utility-scale and <a href=""/Blog-Item-Why-Go-Solar"">residential solar</a>.</p><p><strong>A few key points correcting common misinformation include the following:</strong></p><ul><li>Pennsylvania receives ample sunshine to make solar generation effective.</li><li>Solar arrays can <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/with-agrivoltaics-we-dont-have-choose-between-solar-power-producing-food-2023-03-20/"">coexist with working farms</a>, providing farmers with a sustainable source of income and the opportunity to maximize profit through agrivoltaics, the co-location of solar panels and agriculture. Unlike permanent housing developments, solar development and agricultural land use are not mutually exclusive.</li><li>Well-designed modern solar systems are built to mitigate concerns about erosion, groundwater contamination, and glare.</li><li>The reuse, recycling, and decommissioning of solar panels is feasible and sustainable. Many panels will continue to generate electricity long after a system is decommissioned and can be used in other applications. When it is time to retire the panels, <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/Solar%20Energy%20Supply%20Chain%20Report%20-%20Final.pdf"">90% of their components are recyclable</a> with current technology, which is continually improving.</li></ul><p>In addition to the confusion caused by solar myths, solar development in Pennsylvania also faces more concrete legislative obstacles. Bills currently awaiting action in the Pennsylvania legislature could further solidify the state's dependence on fossil fuels, prevent local efforts to incentivize solar, and burden solar development with greater bonding requirements than dirtier industries. Pennsylvania also lacks legislation that strengthens solar access. To address this issue, lawmakers should enable community solar and <a href=""/Blog-Item-Misguided-Homeowner-Association-Restrictions-Block-Pennsylvanias-Solar-Potential"">curtail HOA solar restrictions</a>.</p><h3>Moving Forward from Pennsylvania's Legacy of Dirty Energy and Polluted Air</h3><p>Solar energy offers a key opportunity to <a href=""/Blog-Item-What-We-Learned-from-the-December-2022-Deep-Freeze-Dont-Rely-on-Natural-Gas-When-Its-Fracking-Cold-Part-1."">enhance the security of our energy grid</a>, create <a href=""https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/82213.pdf"">thousands of jobs</a>, improve <a href=""https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy07osti/41998.pdf"">air quality, and reduce health impacts</a> caused by fossil fuel emissions.</p><p><strong>Policy Recommendations:</strong></p><ul><li>Pennsylvania should increase its solar energy goals through higher Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards targets. The previous AEPS solar goal, 0.5% of the 8% renewable energy goal, was attained in 2021, and a more ambitious target is needed. PennFuture supports <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&SPick=20230&cosponId=40010"">PA Senate Bill 230</a>, which would increase the renewable energy goal to 30% by 2030 and permit community solar.</li><li>Pennsylvania must encourage solar power development on brownfields and through the use of agrivoltaics. The state has plenty of space for solar, especially since solar is a more preferable investment for farms than permanent-conversion developments. Additionally, the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation has found that there are more than <a href=""http://epcamr.org/storage/Abandoned_Mine_Land_Pgm_Fact_Sheet.pdf"">200,000 acres of abandoned mine land in Pennsylvania</a>, which could potentially host solar farms.</li><li>Pennsylvania needs to implement legislation supporting residential solar access, community solar, and more equitable bonding requirements. Rather than perpetuating the dominance of polluting fossil fuels, Pennsylvania lawmakers must focus on pro-solar policies that will yield greater long-term advantages for their constituents.</li></ul><p>PennFuture continues its work promoting clean energy and a sustainable future for all Pennsylvanians. Solar energy is undoubtedly a crucial climate solution that is more affordable than ever. Continued solar restrictions, limited funding for renewable infrastructure, and subsidies for dirty energy are illogical and do a disservice to future generations.</p>",Energy,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
How Humans are Breaking the Jet Stream and Changing the Weather,7/19/2023,"<p>Pennsylvania's weather in 2023 has been strange at best and deadly at worst. Extreme drought in May gave way to historically dangerous air quality in June, with a dash of severe storms and tornadoes for good measure. Forecasters point to wind patterns to explain why the weather has been so extreme. But a deeper dive into what is causing these unusual events points to something more insidious: humans are disrupting the Earth's jet streams.</p><p>Let's start with the basics before this turns into a sequel to Day After Tomorrow.</p><h3><strong>What is a jet stream?</strong></h3><p>Jet streams are like twelve-lane highways in the atmosphere. They are fast-moving currents of air that circle the globe and are usually found at the altitude where commercial airlines fly. Jet streams exist because of temperature differences. The sun warms the Earth unevenly because our planet's axis is tilted, so regions around the equator receive more solar warmth than regions around the poles. The temperature difference between the colder north and south poles and the equator causes wind to blow in fast currents.</p><p>These jet streams play a major role in our daily lives. For example, Pennsylvania has faced numerous energy crises because of the polar vortex, when the northern polar jet dips far south, bringing arctic air with it.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Screen-Shot-2023-07-19-at-2.17.20-PM.png"" alt=""Global jet streams map""></p><p>The image above shows the jet streams on June 29, 2023. Notice the faster-moving lines closer to the top and bottom of the map. In the northern hemisphere, the subtropical jet cuts across the United States and through the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</p><p>For months, forecasters discussed how United States weather has been driven by what is called an <a href=""https://weather.com/forecast/national/news/2023-06-05-omega-block-weather-pattern-united-states-forecast-early-june"">Omega Block</a>, a phenomenon in which the jet stream stops moving predominantly west to east across the country and instead forms large, block-like waves.</p><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Screen-Shot-2023-07-19-at-2.17.50-PM.png"" alt=""United States jet stream map""></p><p>The second map zooms in on the United States during the same time period and highlights this wavy, omega-shaped jet stream pattern, which persisted throughout May and into July. This blockiness locked in dramatic weather patterns, including extreme heat in Texas, numerous tornado outbreaks across the Plains and Deep South, and a pathway for wildfire smoke to travel from Canada into Pennsylvania's airspace.</p><h3><strong>Changing Patterns</strong></h3><p>Omega Blocks are not uncommon, but what is unusual is how persistent and blocky the broader global jet stream pattern has become. Dr. Michael Mann, a climate scientist in Pennsylvania, <a href=""https://www.sciencealert.com/earths-jet-streams-look-as-chaotic-as-a-van-gogh-right-now-and-thats-a-big-problem"">noted</a> that he is honestly at a loss to characterize the current large-scale planetary wave pattern and remarked that it looks like a Van Gogh painting.</p><p>Looking more closely at the first global jet stream map, you can see what Dr. Mann describes. The subtropical jet in the northern hemisphere appears fragmented, discontinuous, and slower compared to jet streams elsewhere on the planet. Over the United States, India, China, and Northern Africa, the lines are lighter in color, indicating slower speeds, and it is difficult to trace a continuous path around the globe. It is subtle but significant.</p><h3><strong>Why does this matter, and what is causing it?</strong></h3><p>Climate change research <a href=""https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2018/10/climate-change-and-extreme-summer-weather-events-the-future-is-still-in-our-hands/"">provides insight</a> into what is happening. Human-caused global warming is rapidly heating the planet, and much of that heat is being concentrated at the poles. For example, the North Atlantic is <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/20/europe/marine-heatwave-north-atlantic-climate-scn-intl/index.html"">experiencing</a> unprecedented ocean temperature increases of 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Arctic sea ice has declined so dramatically that scientists expect it to be <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/world/arctic-sea-ice-free-climate-change/index.html"">ice-free</a> during summer months by the end of this decade. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/13/climate/global-warming-heat-june.html"">global average temperatures</a> in June have been nearly a degree warmer than any month in recorded history.</p><p>Rapid warming in the Arctic fundamentally alters the temperature difference between the poles and the equator. Without a strong temperature gradient, wind currents slow down. In other words, global warming driven by human activity is slowing and even disrupting the planet's jet streams. As the jet stream weakens, blocky wave patterns like the Omega Block grow larger and are more likely to stall.</p><p>Sound familiar to what Pennsylvania has experienced for more than two months?</p><p>In the short term, extreme weather is likely to worsen. Natural climate cycles are also shifting and may amplify human-induced changes, including the rapid warming of the eastern Pacific Ocean known as El Nino, which also alters jet stream behavior and United States weather patterns.</p><p>Human activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, is warming the planet and altering the fundamental dynamics of global jet streams. This adds to the growing list of extreme weather events harming the Commonwealth. The question used to be whether Pennsylvania could or should act on global warming. As climate impacts intensify, the question becomes how quickly we can do everything possible to stop further damage.</p>",Climate,"Matthew Stepp, Vice President and Chief of Staff, PennFuture"
Logistics Facilities are Coming. Is Your Municipality Ready?: PennFuture Releases Model Logistics Use Ordinance and Guidebook,7/11/2023,"<p>Pennsylvania municipalities should update their zoning ordinances to reflect societal changes. In the United States, one of the most significant societal changes of recent years is the rise of e-commerce and the expansion of the logistics industry, the part of the supply chain that includes acquiring, storing, and shipping goods to their final destination.</p><h3><strong>How to Manage Big Commercial Development</strong></h3><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Distrib-Centers-2.jpg"" alt=""Distribution centers"">As online shopping has become a major source of retail goods in the 21st century, logistics industry practices have changed, and so has the industry's demand for land. Even though they are commonly called ""warehouses,"" today's logistics facilities are not the long-term-storage-based warehouses of the past. They are massive distribution and fulfillment centers with the potential to generate far-reaching traffic, noise, aesthetic, and environmental impacts unanticipated by zoning ordinances drafted long before this development pattern was even a remote possibility.</p><p>Municipalities cannot ignore this new pattern of development and cannot simply ban distribution and fulfillment centers from within their borders. They must proactively plan for the day when distribution and fulfillment centers come to town by adopting ordinances that reflect the reality that these land uses differ significantly from traditional warehouses.</p><h3><strong>A Powerful Tool for Local Governments</strong></h3><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Distrib-Centers-1.jpg"" alt=""Distribution center facility"">These are the reasons why PennFuture has created a <a href=""/Publication-Living-With-Logistics-A-Model-Logistics-Use-Zoning-Ordinance-for-Pennsylvania-Municipalities"">Model Logistics Zoning Ordinance</a>. Zoning ordinances are the most powerful tool municipalities have to control how land is used and to ensure that community growth is orderly and reasonable and does not outpace a community's ability to provide adequate water, sewer, school, recreational, and public safety services and employment opportunities. Zoning is also a way for municipalities to preserve valuable natural resources such as forests, waterways, wetlands, aquifers, and floodplains by directing development away from these areas and by imposing restrictions on development that may impact these resources. Zoning also provides a predictable regulatory environment for developers and the public.</p><p>PennFuture's Model Ordinance gives municipalities a template for updating their zoning ordinances to address the modern reality of the logistics industry and its impact on communities and the environment. The Model Ordinance provides updated definitions for logistics uses and divides them into three categories based on size and ability to generate traffic. It also imposes restrictions based on these characteristics. For example, under the Model Ordinance, logistics facilities that generate significant truck traffic must be located within a half-mile of an expressway, install signage to direct truck drivers away from local roads, and provide overnight truck parking and amenities for drivers. Large facilities over 25,000 square feet must have buffer yards to separate them from neighboring properties and must plant trees and shrubs to lessen their visual and noise impact.</p><p>All logistics facilities, regardless of size, must incorporate certain environmental protections such as a minimum 100-foot-wide buffer zone around all waterways, lakes, and ponds and a limitation on woodland disturbance. All facilities are also eligible for impervious pavement credits to mitigate the negative impact of the vast impervious surfaces they generate. Finally, PennFuture recommends that all but the smallest, least impactful logistics facilities be designated as conditional uses or special exception uses, regardless of which zoning district they are in. This provides municipalities and the public the opportunity to review and comment on proposed facilities during a public hearing to determine whether they are appropriate for the proposed location.</p><h3><strong>Designed for Any Municipality in Pennsylvania</strong></h3><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Distrib-Centers.jpg"" alt=""Logistics development"">The Model Logistics Use Zoning Ordinance is based on the information and experience PennFuture staff has gained through engagement with community members and municipalities in the Lehigh Valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, the logistics hub of the East Coast. The Model Ordinance draws on PennFuture's participation in local land use hearings and appeals, research into how the e-commerce logistics industry works, and review of existing and proposed zoning ordinances that attempt to address the growing and changing logistics industry in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Along with the accompanying guidebook, which provides additional guidance for adopting the Model Ordinance and tailoring it to the needs of each community, as well as factual support for the proposed provisions, the Model Ordinance provides an excellent starting point for municipalities across Pennsylvania as they bring their zoning ordinances into the 21st century.</p><p>PennFuture urges municipalities across Pennsylvania to review their existing zoning ordinances to determine whether they adequately address modern logistics uses and the significant impacts these massive facilities generate. If they do not, PennFuture urges municipalities to adopt its Model Logistics Use Ordinance before it is too late.</p><h3><strong>Are you interested in learning more?</strong></h3><p><img src=""/Files/Admin/Distrib-Centers-3.jpg"" alt=""Warehouse facility"">PennFuture will host an upcoming webinar where you can learn more about our Model Ordinance.

While the Supreme Court did not say BSER ""refers </span><span>exclusively </span><span>to measures that improve the pollution performance of individual sources,"" it nevertheless ruled against the EPA </span><span>on this issue </span><span>and left it to the Biden Administration to craft a new plan.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>The EPA proposed its new rule on May 23, 2023.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>This time, the EPA based their emissions standards for most of the larger fossil-fuel facilities on implementing 90% carbon capture or co-firing some percentage ""low-GHG"" hydrogen along with the existing fossil fuels.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Both methods look much more like the traditional technology-based emissions controls the EPA has used for decades, but this does not mean that any facility needs to install carbon capture technology or burn any hydrogen. The EPA's plan only sets standards of performance-states, like Pennsylvania, are then given the flexibility to decide how facilities must meet that target and, for existing facilities, can take into consideration the remaining useful life of the plant along with other factors (RULOF).</span></span></p><h3 dir=""ltr""><img src=""/Files/Admin/Power-Plants-%283%29.jpg"" /><strong><span><span>State action to cut carbon</span></span></strong></h3><h3 dir=""ltr""></h3><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>While we probably won't know exactly what is in our state's plan before the summer of 2026, we can envision some possibilities.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>First, this rule will not impact Pennsylvania's large conventional coal-fired power plants. The four remaining facilities are all scheduled to retire or convert to gas-fired generation by 2028, and this new rule won't go into effect until 2030.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Pennsylvania's waste-coal-fired power plants may largely avoid significant impacts as well. BSER for such plants that retire by 2032 or that will run with limited capacity as late as 2035 consists of ""routine methods of operation and maintenance""-that is, business as usual. We don't know precisely when the existing plants will retire, but most of Pennsylvania's waste coal facilities came online in the early 1990s and wouldn't be running today without huge subsidies</span><span> funded by state taxpayers</span><span> and electric ratepayers. Market forces could quickly drive most of them offline before more stringent emissions standards are required.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>The 2026 State Plan will, therefore, likely focus on existing fracked-gas-fired power plants, a</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>few newer fracked-gas-fired power plants, and whatever remaining waste-coal facilities are still in operation. For each of these, the state will calculate a target emissions level that meets BSER according to the EPA rules by the applicable compliance deadline. Then, the DEP (Department of Environmental Protection) will need to craft a plan that will ""ultimately provide for equivalent stringency as would be achieved if each affected source was achieving the applicable presumptive standard of performance, after accounting for any application of RULOF.""</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Its unclear how much RULOF will have an impact on the eventual state targets. While states have a right to consider this, the EPA already made allowances for plants nearing retirement or running at low capacities when it set BSER. It would make sense for EPA to limit any further weakening of the performance standards to special cases it hasn't already considered.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>With the final numbers in hand, designing a plan with ""equivalent stringency"" raises the prospect of what the EPA calls ""compliance flexibilities."" While that could include plants using newly invented control technologies the EPA had yet to specifically consider, the EPA clearly has something else in mind. It specifically proposes to allow states to use ""averaging and market-based mechanisms"" in their plans.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>In Pennsylvania, that raises the prospect of participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) being a creditable measure. There are certainly details to be worked out</span><span> and </span><span>in fact, EPA is specifically asking for comments on how to make interstate emissions trading work in this context among other issues. But one can foresee RGGI emissions reductions being subtracted from an aggregate statewide target and that credit, in turn, being apportioned to individual facilities in some manner. As the EPA notes, such trading programs tend to be highly cost-effective because they allow owners to ""prioritize emission reduction actions where they are the quickest or cheapest.""</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Along with trading, the EPA is also considering using banking programs. </span><span>Essentially, that means allowing facilities that meet their targets earlier than required to carry over credit for those reductions to a later control period. The good part of banking is that it encourages emission reductions to happen faster than they otherwise would, still unless the program is well designed, a surplus of banked credits could undermine the program's effectiveness in later years. </span><span>If this appears in the state plan, we'll need to carefully consider the details.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span><img src=""/Files/Admin/AP_051019024812.jpg"" /></span></span><strong><span><span>Concerns, and the need to act </span><span>now</span></span></strong></p><h3 dir=""ltr""></h3><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>While meaningful federal action to address the growing climate crisis is long overdue, it's also critical that whatever path we take, we do things right.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>While co-firing low-GHG hydrogen in a fossil fuel plant likely fits the Clean Air Act's definition of ""Best System of Emissions Reduction,"" that does not mean it is the best choice for getting us to net zero.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>While the EPA's definition of ""low-GHG"" hydrogen doesn't exclude clean hydrogen made from renewable energy, it's doubtful anyone will co-fire clean hydrogen to any significant degree. It makes little sense to start with clean electricity, make hydrogen, then burn the hydrogen to generate less electricity than you started with. In practice, the hydrogen that gets used will likely come from steam reformed methane, which will drive more fracking.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>The EPA attempted to address the pollution from fracking and other upstream sources by defining low-GHG hydrogen based on ""well to gate"" emissions. Still, the resulting expansion of the petrochemical industry presents an incredibly significant problem.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>There are better choices than using carbon capture and storage (CCS). Aside from the technical challenges of achieving 90% carbon capture and the outstanding questions of whether we can reliably store the carbon underground in Pennsylvania, we know that doing so will not be cheap.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>The EPA projects their plan will return $85 billion in net climate and public health benefits over the next two decades, which certainly isn't bad, but we can still do better. The US Supreme Court might not allow EPA to consider much more cost-effective investments in clean renewable generation and energy efficiency as part of the BSER, but that does not mean Pennsylvania can't make better choices for itself.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>No matter what path we take, we cannot wait until 2030 and beyond to act.

A key principle is to have soil that is not compacted, but is soft, with lots of space between the bits of dirt in the ground (the technical term is ""pore space""). Think of it like a loaf of bread: wonderbread is even and smooth, while an English muffin has those nooks and crannies. In uncompacted soils, when it rains or when snow melts, the water has lots of places to go and filters into the ground before eventually making its way into a nearby stream, pond, or other waterbody. When soil gets really compacted, water just runs straight off the surface, bringing sediment and other pollutants along that can harm pristine waters like Swiftwater Creek. To maintain the hydrological condition, we needed the site to maintain (where possible) and restore (where necessary) that soft nooks-and-crannies type of soil.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-b1fefbb6-7fff-f0eb-5fee-fa1fca2f243f""><span background-color:="""" color:="""" font-variant-alternates:="""" font-variant-east-asian:="""" font-variant-numeric:="""" new="""" times="""" vertical-align:="""" white-space:="""">Clearing forests is concerning because forests are recognized for being great natural filters and protectors of streams, and this is because they create conditions that slow down rainwater and reduce surface runoff in a couple ways. First, the trees, shrubs, and groundcover all help physically slow down the rainwater as it reaches the ground. Then, the root systems of all these plants, which can run very deep, help to keep the soil in a relatively ""fluffy"" state, with the ""nooks and crannies"" mentioned above.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-b1fefbb6-7fff-f0eb-5fee-fa1fca2f243f""><span background-color:="""" color:="""" font-variant-alternates:="""" font-variant-east-asian:="""" font-variant-numeric:="""" new="""" times="""" vertical-align:="""" white-space:="""">However, forests are not the only thing that can do this well. A true meadow, one seeded with native plants that vary in height and have high resiliency, can also be a great filter for stormwater in the same ways that forests are. Now, the term ""meadow"" can be tricky because it is a word that has both a technical use but is also is often used casually in a number of different ways. A farmer might think of a hay pasture meadow, seeded with grasses for yield and nutrition. A biologist might think of a grassland meadow where plants are allowed to flower, grow, and self-seed without grazing. And most average people might simply think of a lush field of grass and maybe flowers, without worrying about what kind of grasses or flowers they are. But the composition is important to the performance, and the plants that grow above ground also affect what is happening below ground, and what happens when it rains and storms. Consider the average lawn: a uniform, non-native grass that is kept at a consistent short height does not do a great job of creating space for water to infiltrate.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-b1fefbb6-7fff-f0eb-5fee-fa1fca2f243f""><span background-color:="""" color:="""" font-variant-alternates:="""" font-variant-east-asian:="""" font-variant-numeric:="""" new="""" times="""" vertical-align:="""" white-space:="""">So here, where the goal is to create the kind of meadow that protects the soil and natural resources, we needed to be sure that what was being installed was the kind of true meadow.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-b1fefbb6-7fff-f0eb-5fee-fa1fca2f243f""><span background-color:="""" color:="""" font-variant-alternates:="""" font-variant-east-asian:="""" font-variant-numeric:="""" new="""" times="""" vertical-align:="""" white-space:="""">In the end, Swiftwater Solar agreed to a number of changes in its construction practices and its restoration practices that will achieve this.

Updated Zoning Ordinances Are Vital to Addressing the Impacts of Today’s Logistics Industry,6/5/2023,"<div ><p><span><span>Like any law, zoning ordinances should be updated to reflect changes in society. One of the most significant changes impacting land use in Pennsylvania today is the rise of e-commerce and the massive logistics facilities that support it. As online shopping has become a major source of retail goods, industry practices have changed, and land development patterns have changed along with them. No longer the long-term-storage-based ""warehouse"" uses of the past, 21st century logistics facilities like distribution centers, fulfillment centers, and truck terminals are substantially larger, with an emphasis on rapid turnover of massive quantities of goods and materials.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Previous PennFuture blog,</span><a href=""/Blog-Item-The-True-Cost-of-Convenience-The-Impacts-of-Never-Ending-Warehouse-Development""><span> The True Cost of Convenience: The Impacts of Never-Ending Warehouse Development</span></a><span>, discusses the driving forces behind this new pattern of development and the detrimental impacts that result.</span><a href=""/Blog-Item-Distribution-Centers-Bring-into-Focus-Limitations-of-Local-Zoning-Laws""><span> Distribution Centers Bring into Focus Limitations of Local Zoning Laws</span></a><span> explores how Coolbaugh Township in Monroe County discovered the importance of well-crafted zoning ordinances in controlling the proliferation of logistics facilities in the Poconos and beyond. In this blog, we will look at a recently proposed zoning amendment in another Monroe County municipality that is hoping to get ahead of the massive influx of logistics facilities that threaten the health of our communities and our special protection waters.</span></span></p><h3></h3><p><span><span>Case Study - Jackson Township, Monroe County</span></span></p><div><p><span><span>Updated Definitions</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Jackson Township has taken steps to update its zoning ordinance to address logistics uses. Its proposed ordinance, to be considered for approval at a public meeting on June 7, 2023, builds on lessons learned in Coolbaugh Township.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>To begin, Jackson Township's proposed ordinance includes clearer definitions of Warehouse and Distribution Center/Logistics Center. Where the existing ordinance defines a warehouse as ""a building or group of buildings primarily used for the indoor storage, transfer and distribution of products and materials,"" the proposed ordinance clarifies that a warehouse shall only consist of indoor storage of products and materials and cannot include ""value-added"" activities typical of distribution and fulfillment centers such as breaking down large orders into smaller orders, packaging, and order fulfillment. With this new definition, the proposed ordinance makes clear that any facility that goes beyond mere storage is not a warehouse.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In addition, where the existing ordinance treats all warehouses the same, regardless of size, the proposed ordinance recognizes that today's warehouses are no longer exclusively small- to medium-sized facilities that can blend easily into a typical industrial or commercial area. Therefore, the proposed ordinance divides warehouses into two categories: Small Warehouses (up to 25,000 sq. ft.) and Large Warehouses (25,000 sq. ft. and above). Large Warehouses are subject to greater restrictions than Small Warehouses.</span></span></p><p><a href=""/Files/Admin/Dead_Wholesale_store_in_Pittsburgh-_Pennsylvania_(9311821912).jpg"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/Files/Admin/Dead_Wholesale_store_in_Pittsburgh-_Pennsylvania_%289311821912%29.jpg"" /></a><img alt=""Walmart Distribution Center in Tomah, Wisconsin"" src=""/Files/Admin/Walmart_distribution_center_in_Tomah-_Wisconsin_9_pano.jpg"" /></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Jackson Township's proposed ordinance also updates the definition of Distribution Center/Truck Terminal by strengthening the distinction between Distribution Centers/Truck Terminals and Warehouses. The proposed definition makes clear that value-added services, which are explicitly excluded from the definition of Warehouse, are one of the defining characteristics of a Distribution Center/Truck Terminal. The proposed ordinance also eliminates potentially-confusing language in the existing ordinance that allows a Warehouse to be ""part of the operation"" of a Distribution Center/Truck Terminal. In the proposed ordinance, these two uses are clearly distinct from one another.</span></span></p><p><br /><span><span>Most significantly, the proposed ordinance treats any Large Warehouse that will generate more than 50 tractor-trailer trips in any 24-hour period as a Distribution Center/Truck Terminal. This is especially important because third-party developers often construct logistics facilities on speculation or ""on spec."" This means the developer does not know who will occupy the facility when it is completed</span><span><span>1. </span></span><span>Developers can take advantage of this uncertainty by simply declaring that their facility is a storage-only Warehouse, not a Distribution Center/Truck Terminal offering value-added services. Without knowing who will ultimately occupy the building, municipalities and residents are forced to take developers at their word. Jackson Township's 50-vehicle-trip trigger closes this loophole by linking regulation of the facility to an objective measurement that a developer must provide when applying for zoning approval. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Large Warehouses and Distribution Centers to Require Conditional Use Approval</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Jackson Township's new, more precise definitions allow the Township to craft additional zoning restrictions suited to the different types of uses.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>For example, under the existing ordinance, Warehouses of any size are permitted as of right in the Township's I-Industrial district. This means that any facility that meets the definition of a warehouse and complies with building size and setbacks requirements, even a 1 million square foot facility, could be built anywhere in the I-Industrial district without review or approval by the Board of Supervisors or public input as to whether the use is appropriate in that location.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>The proposed ordinance changes this. Both Large and Small Warehouses are still limited to the I-Industrial district, but only Small Warehouses can be built without additional zoning review. Under the proposed ordinance, Large Warehouses are conditional uses, meaning that the Township Supervisors must review each proposed Large Warehouse to make sure it satisfies the specific requirements in the zoning ordinance. The Board of Supervisors must hold a public hearing and allow the public to weigh in on the proposal. This process also gives the Board of Supervisors an opportunity to impose conditions on approval, which is not possible with uses permitted by right.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>The proposed ordinance also adds new, specific requirements that Large Warehouses must meet to obtain zoning approval from the Board of Supervisors. These requirements are related to the impacts generated by these massive facilities and include:</span></span></p><ul dir=""ltr""><li><span><span>A description of the nature and scale of on-site activities;</span></span></li><li><span><span>A detailed description of potential environmental impacts;</span></span></li><li><span><span>Evidence that the number of truck parking spaces will be adequate to accommodate expected demand; and</span></span></li><li><span><span>A traffic study.</span></span></li></ul><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Under both the existing ordinance and the proposed ordinance, Distribution Centers/Truck Terminals are conditional uses in the I-Industrial district and are subject to the same review process. However, the proposed ordinance enhances the Township's power to control Distribution Center/Truck Terminal by adding new requirements a developer must satisfy to obtain approval.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Under the existing ordinance, the only requirements for zoning approval of a Distribution Center/Truck Terminal are a 5-acre minimum lot size, a 100-foot setback from residential areas and a 50-foot setback from commercial areas. The proposed ordinance adds new requirements aimed at mitigating the impacts of these facilities, particularly traffic impacts.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>These include:</span></span></p><ul dir=""ltr""><li><span><span>A 10-acre minimum lot size;</span></span></li><li><span><span>A 150-foot setback between the facility and residential property lines;</span></span></li><li><span><span>On-site stacking area for tractor-trailers;</span></span></li><li><span><span>Prohibition against parking, loading and unloading on any public road;</span></span></li><li><span><span>Amenities for the comfort, convenience and safety of truck drivers;</span></span></li><li><span><span>A traffic study; and</span></span></li><li><span><span>An environmental impact assessment.</span></span></li></ul><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>PennFuture is pleased to see Jackson Township taking these steps toward a more comprehensive and effective ordinance that will enhance the Township's ability to regulate logistics uses, and we support their amendment.</span></span></p><h2 dir=""ltr""><span><span>Possible Improvements to Better Protect High Quality Streams</span></span></h2><h2></h2><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Although Jackson Township's proposed ordinance is a substantial improvement over its existing ordinance, there is some room to improve the ordinance to provide greater protection for special protection waters.</span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Several streams</span><a href=""https://www.goamplify.com/blog/business/spec-construction-loans/""><span> designated</span></a><span> as High Quality waters by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection flow through Jackson Township's I-Industrial zone.

Otherwise, Pennsylvania will continue missing out on solar benefits.</span></span></p><div><img src=""/Files/Admin/Installation_of_solar_PV_panels_-_panels_in_place_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2624288.jpg"" /></div><div><strong><span><span><span>Cost Predictability:</span></span></span></strong></div><p><span><span>For one, solar energy offers homeowners reliable power with predictable costs: a benefit that cannot be derived from fossil fuels.</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span id=""docs-internal-guid-375d74f0-7fff-dc10-e9c8-555d4d0c28e7""><span>During </span><a href=""/Blog-Item-What-We-Learned-from-the-December-2022-Deep-Freeze-Dont-Rely-on-Natural-Gas-When-Its-Fracking-Cold-Part-1""><span>December 2022 Winter Storm Elliott</span></a><span>, wholesale energy prices (from failing fracked gas plants) soared, leaving many homeowners questioning whether continued dependence on fracked gas is good for their wallets.</span></span></li><li><span id=""docs-internal-guid-375d74f0-7fff-dc10-e9c8-555d4d0c28e7""><span>Fracked gas must be purchased constantly at an average of </span><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/business/energy-environment/solar-and-wind-energy-start-to-win-on-price-vs-conventional-fuels.html#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20by,and%20coal%20at%206.6%20cents.""><span>$0.061 per kilowatt-hour and coal at $0.066</span></a><span>, whereas rooftop solar power is free once the system cost is covered-and there is not much room for fossil fuels prices to decrease.</span></span></li><li><span id=""docs-internal-guid-375d74f0-7fff-dc10-e9c8-555d4d0c28e7""><span>Costs of home heating oil are also rising: according to the </span><a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=54699#:~:text=Residential%20heating%20oil%20prices%20rose,imports%2C%20and%20limited%20production%20capacity.""><span>U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)</span></a><span>, U.S. heating oil prices were 65% higher in October 2022 than the previous year, reaching a high of $5.90 per gallon on November 7, 2022.</span></span></li></ul></div><h3><strong><span><span id=""docs-internal-guid-5d6a373d-7fff-22ea-0039-3e0edf264146""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-5d6a373d-7fff-22ea-0039-3e0edf264146""><span>Healthier Energy Source:</span></span></span></span></strong></h3><p><span><span>Not only are fossil fuels increasingly expensive, but they are also </span><a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/climate-change-health-impacts-pennsylvania-ib.pdf""><span>detrimental to our health</span></a><span> and environment.

In 2008, the National Research Council and the Environmental Protection Agency released a report identifying unmanaged stormwater from rain or snow events as a significant source of water pollution.

Philly Spill Scare: This Is Why We Fight,4/4/2023,"<p><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Last week, Philadelphians dealt with the fallout of a chemical spill into the Delaware River, their drinking water source. By mid-week, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) and the city announced that the chemical plume-and thus the immediate danger-had passed and that the city's drinking water had tested safe. <a href=""/News-In-Drinking-Water-Scare-Philly-Should-Stay-Mad-at-its-Complacent-Leaders"">PennFuture</a> and others have rightly and roundly criticized the response of City officials as a case study of what not to do in a potential environmental crisis, so today, I'm here to talk about something else.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Now that the initial emergency has passed, I cannot help but think: ""This is</span><em>exactly</em><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">why we fight for the environmental protections we have and fight to make them stronger.""</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">We have many unanswered questions about the spill-Why did the city wait so long to tell folks? How sensitive is the testing that PWD is doing? How will they do better next time?-but one of the things that seems true is that the city, at least, found out about the spill in time to shut off the water intakes from the Delaware. This wasn't the result of corporate benevolence or some happy accident but of some (largely invisible) protections:</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Folks should know first that this report happened because it was required to do so: Pennsylvania's Clean Streams Law, 25 Pa. Code § 91.33(a), requires</span><em>any</em><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">polluter who spills a substance that could endanger downstream users to report the spill to DEP immediately.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">What kind of substance counts?

Unfortunately, we may not know this disasters long-term health and environmental impacts for months or even years.</p><p>The gradual release and burn of these chemicals increased the risk that they spread beyond the crash site. With butyl acrylate found in local surface water, testing the groundwater supply and subsoil is crucial. We encourage anyone concerned about pollution and the safety of their community to document their observations and request soil and well water testing from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p><p>The residents of East Palestine and neighboring communities deserve transparency around the EPAs plan for continued air quality monitoring and the data of air tests.</p><p>Regardless of location and as a regular practice, residents should report any unusual odor or changes in environmental conditions to the appropriate state environmental agency.

Thirty-eight rail cars went off the tracks and caught fire.</p><p><a href=""https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20230214.aspx"">According to the National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB)</a>, the investigating agency, a residents home surveillance video showed what appears to be a wheel bearing in the final stage of overheating failure moments before the derailment.</p><p>The fear of a possible explosion forced the evacuation of 1,500 to 2,000 residents in a town of only 4,900.</p><h3><strong>An Explanation of the Environmental Disaster</strong></h3><p><img src=""/Files/Images/Smoke_from_the_fire_on_the_night_of_the_accident_%28v0wn4mB%29.jpg"" /></p><p>The train towed 20 cars with hazardous material-11 of which derailed. Five overturned cars contained vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make PVC plastic and vinyl products. According to the National Cancer Institute, it is a flammable gas and cancer-causing.</p><p>Norfolk Southern said some cars carrying vinyl chloride were at risk of exploding. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine authorized a controlled burn of the chemicals on Monday, February 6. This burn resulted in a massive smoke plume.</p><p><strong>Vinyl Chloride</strong></p><p>When burned, vinyl chloride breaks down into two chemicals: hydrogen chloride and phosgene. Phosgene is highly poisonous-used in chemical warfare during World War I and responsible for many deaths, <a href=""https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/phosgene/basics/facts.asp"">according to the CDC</a>. While long-term exposure to higher concentrations of the gas can be deadly, the gas released by Norfolk did not result in reports of injuries or fatalities.</p><p>Hydrogen chloride can cause eye, skin, and respiratory irritation and pain.</p><p><strong>Other Chemicals Onboard</strong></p><p>In addition to vinyl chloride, the EPA listed the following chemicals as also on the train:</p><ul><li>Butyl acrylate - a liquid used for making paint, adhesives, and sealants</li><li>Ethylhexyl acrylate - a liquid used for making paint, printing inks, and plastics, is toxic to the lungs and nervous system</li><li>Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether - an industrial solvent that can be absorbed through the skin and is toxic to the liver and kidneys</li><li>Isobutylene - ​​a gas used in antioxidants, packaging, plastics, and high-octane plane fuel</li></ul><p>Its currently known that the derailment caused the release of butyl acrylate and ethylhexyl acrylate, which leaked into the ground, nearby streams, and storm drains.</p><p>Another major cause for alarm is the areas of contaminated soil and free liquids that, according to the EPA, <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-02/Norfolk%20Southern%20East%20Palestine%20Train%20Derailment%20General%20Notice%20Letter%202.10.2023%20%281%29.pdf"">""were observed and potentially covered and/or filled during reconstruction of the rail line including portions of the trench /burn pit that was used for the open burn off of vinyl chloride.""</a></p><p>Having multiple chemicals released adds to the complexity of the situation.</p><p>On Tuesday, February 21, EPAAdministrator Michael Regan ordered Norfolk Southern Railway to pay for the contaminated soil and water cleanup and reimburse the EPA for the private cleanup of residential homes and businesses. This order enables the EPA to force Norfolk Southern to adhere to a plan set and managed by the EPA.</p><h3><strong>Health Impacts</strong></h3><p>The EPA monitored the air quality and tested East Palestines municipal drinking water well. Private well water testing is ongoing and residents with wells are told to still use bottled water. The EPA did not yet release the data from air monitor testing.</p><p><strong>Drinking Water</strong></p><p>Ohio Gov. DeWine said on Wednesday, February 16, that the water in East Palestines municipal system is <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2023/02/15/ohio-train-derailment-water-safe"">safe to drink</a> based on the Ohio Environmental Protection Agencys results, however:</p><ul><li>The Ohio EPA recommends people using private wells for drinking water schedule an appointment for well water testing.</li><li>The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will conduct independent water sampling to monitor water contamination risks related to the train derailment closely.</li></ul><p><strong>Air Monitoring</strong></p><p>Air quality monitors are a tool to measure exposure to air contaminants, but the technology has limitations. While the EPA has come out to say the air quality in and around East Palestine is safe for residents to return home, officials have not provided any data from the air tests.</p><p>Depending on which types of air monitors the EPA is utilizing, they may not be providing the exact chemical breakdown and measurements in the air.</p><p>How a healthy first responder reacts to a particular air quality measurement differs from an older adult or a child.</p><p>The EPA needs to be transparent with community members on the technology used to test air quality, the limitations of the equipment, the chemical specificity found, and the measurements.</p><h3><strong>Environmental Impacts</strong></h3><p>The Norfolk Southern train carried 20 cars with hazardous materials. After the spill, chemicals-including an entire load of butyl acrylates-were seen running into storm drains and water sources.</p><p>As of Tuesday, February 21-two weeks after the train derailment-Norfolk Southern reported the chemical spill contaminated at least 15,000 pounds of soil and 1.1 million gallons of water.</p><p>Locals documented images of dead fish and an oily sheen along Ohio River tributaries days after the spill.

Misguided Homeowner Association Restrictions Block Pennsylvania’s Solar Potential,2/5/2023,"<p><strong>By Caroline Weiss, Legal Intern</strong></p><p>Lately, homeowners are coming across unlikely opponents to their solar ambitions. In states without solar access legislation, new restrictions are being implemented by homeowners associations.</p><p>For ""aesthetic"" reasons, HOAs all too often prohibit installation of solar panels on homeowners' rooftops. Even when they lack solar bylaws, HOAs can be reluctant to have conversations with their members about the possibility of solar in their neighborhood.</p><p>Restrictions can sometimes be quite unfair or illogical: solar panels may only be allowed on the side of the roof that is not visible from the street- thus often disregarding the fact that solar panels are more effective on south-facing roofs. Preventing homeowners from installing solar on their own properties also limits potential benefits such as higher property values, lower electricity costs, and non-polluting renewable energy. In fact, homes with installed solar can, on average, sell for 4 percent more than properties without solar systems, according to<a href=""https://www.zillow.com/research/solar-panels-house-sell-more-23798/"">Zillow</a>. These reasons are why many are calling for changes to solar-restricting practices.</p><p>Ohio recently addressed these concerns with legislation that grants extra protections for individuals who install solar panels on their own property. Ohio's<a href=""https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/134/sb61"">Senate Bill 61</a>, passed June 14, 2022 and in effect since September 13, 2022, specifically applies to homeowners in condominiums and planned communities, who are subject to HOA regulations. Under this<a href=""https://www.dickinson-wright.com/news-alerts/-ohio-legislature-adopts-new-protections-for-solar-access"">bipartisan bill</a>, homeowners are permitted to install solar panels unless explicitly prohibited by the HOA declaration, as long as one of the<a href=""https://search-prod.lis.state.oh.us/solarapi/v1/general_assembly_134/bills/sb61/EN/05/sb61_05_EN?format=pdf"">following conditions</a>apply:</p><ul><li>The condominium unit includes the roof (as defined in the declaration), thus the owner is responsible for costs related to the roof, or</li><li>The declaration expressly permits solar panels and ""establishes responsibility for the cost to insure, maintain, repair, and replace such devices.""</li></ul><p>HOAs can still retain the ability to establish ""reasonable restrictions"" on solar panel size and placement, which may differ for each community. While this law clearly does not grant full rights to homeowners to install solar as desired without restrictions, SB 61 is<a href=""https://www.natlawreview.com/article/ohio-sb-61-adds-protections-solar-panels-condominium-and-planned-community-homes"">apositive change</a>from prior Ohio law, which allowed HOAs to prohibit solar entirely.</p><p>Ohio State Senator Nickie Antonio<a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__solarunitedneighbors-2Dorg.zoom.us_rec_share_yf-2DAUSILu4EmeDDd5lJfWsN9sj0CICLX6qbxzX7wLzTADRHyoclFNEEVpP5qyPck.LDX3PC6c9qQjYBqM-3FstartTime-3D1674486151000&d=DwMFAw&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=FWlGgRActI0u6Isyl7Nzu50dSmcEuzpnuGVzmbjyYL8&m=_7uswVlUwfgRz-9zt_BLnYhjoKptxIFy8u5_pir7Dhs&s=QV2NHQ85b3S0wsQ5zbGNplUBtE6pIBW9IkEDettPBbQ&e="">spoke last month</a>about her reasons for supporting SB 61.

Leader Antonio said that the bill's success in Ohio was derived from luck, timing, and relationships, as well as the time in which it was considered: over the course of two general assemblies, there was ample time to educate members to garner support.</p><p>This type of education is especially important as we see more and more anti-solar sentiment being promoted, sometimes perpetuated by the oil and gas industry.For example,<a href=""http://www.paenvironmentdigest.com/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=52705&SubjectID="">misconceptions of solar</a>have been expressed by Pennsylvania leadership, resulting in stalled pro-solar legislation and the introduction of anti-solar bills-such as Senate Bills<a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&sind=0&body=S&type=B&bn=275"">275</a>,<a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&sind=0&body=S&type=B&bn=284"">284</a>, and<a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&sind=0&body=S&type=B&bn=792"">792</a>. Each piece of legislation is a clear attempt to manufacture concerns to raise fear, uncertainty, and doubt about solar. In Pennsylvania, local cities, townships and boroughs have the ability to regulate solar through<a href=""https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/research/publications/regulating-utility-scale-solar-projects-on-agricultural-land/"">municipal zoning ordinances</a>.<a href=""https://www.farmanddairy.com/news/majority-of-local-zoning-codes-in-pa-lack-guidance-on-solar/666604.html"">A Penn State Dickinson Law review</a>of 2,500 local ordinances revealed, however, that only 13 percent of municipalities addressed solar of any kind in these codes. Some municipal ordinances make it harder for solar to be sited than, say, a gas-fired power plant.</p><p>Lack of solar access is a problem in Pennsylvania as well. Tony Ranieri, founder and president of Ohio solar installation company<a href=""https://www.solarisfreedom.com/"">Solar is Freedom</a>, also spoke to the benefits of solar for the energy economy in his state. Ranieri said that his business and that of other solar installers increases substantially with solar access legislation. As more homeowners are granted the opportunity to go solar, their choice to do so reduces grid pressure and overall cost per kilowatt-hour of energy.</p><p>Ohios neighboring success highlights Pennsylvania's lack of solar access legislation.<a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&SPick=20210&cosponId=35408"">Senate Bill 826</a>, introduced by Senator Katie Muth in July 2021, would ensure that HOAs permit solar panel installations. This bill is still awaiting a vote, unfortunately. With every session that our legislators fail to take action to protect homeowners' property rights, our state falls even further behind on advancing home rooftop solar's potential. HOAs' solar restrictions should be curtailed all across the Commonwealth. Doing so would advance equity in property rights and allow homeowners the ability to enjoy greater environmental and economic benefits.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy,
Introducing PennFuture’s New Legal & Policy Interns!,1/30/2023,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania's environment and ""create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.""</p><p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p><p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognize that we need to be more involved with cultivating the people that will continue to support our mission. Our staff have a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.</p><p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal and policy internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment.</p><p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting Pennsylvania as well as to further their potential environmental careers. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.</p><p>This spring, we have two fantastic students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We've asked our new interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture's mission means to them:</p><p><strong>Lisa Dang, Third Year Student at Penn State Dickinson Law</strong></p><p>I have always had a penchant for environmental issues. During my undergraduate studies at William and Mary, I participated in a semester-long study abroad program in Cambodia and Vietnam, exploring environmental and climate change impacts on local communities located along the Mekong River. Immediately after undergrad, I worked at Environment Virginia, coordinating and implementing grassroots activities to advocate for environmental justice and renewable energy. Additionally, I interned at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project (PULP), serving at-risk communities affected by utility and energy-related matters.</p><p>As a 3L at Penn State Dickinson Law, I have continued to pursue environmental policy and law classes, further driving my passion and commitment to help foster a more sustainable future. I spent significant time researching the feasibility of deploying solar technology in K-12 public school systems in Pennsylvania.</p><p>I am thrilled to be a part of the PennFuture team, working with passionate, diverse environmental law attorneys to tackle a wide range of environmental issues. I relish the opportunity to learn and help protect Pennsylvania's right to clean air, water, and environment.</p><p>Beyond work and school, I enjoy playing competitive ultimate frisbee. Currently, I play for DC Shadow and Scandal based in Washington, DC.</p><p><strong>Caroline Weiss, graduate student at the University of Iceland in Environment and Natural Resources, with a specialization in environmental policy</strong></p><p>I am currently pursuing my Master's in Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Iceland, where I am specializing in environmental policy and management. Beginning my undergraduate study at the University of Pittsburgh, I had never envisioned myself double majoring in Environmental Studies and Political Science. Yet my introductory Environmental Science course, sustainability-focused extracurriculars, and childhood influence converged as I recognized my passion for environmental issues. I had grown up hiking most weekends, learning the importance of recycling and conserving at home, and volunteering at Heritage Creek Farm Camp, which ignited my appreciation for the natural world.</p><p>Throughout my studies, I have been drawn to the social sciences and policy as tools to drive environmental change. From my participation in Pitt's environmental honors fraternity, internships at the Sierra Club and Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, and study abroad experience in Iceland, I gained an even deeper understanding of the value of policy and education to advance environmental solutions. I am eager to learn from PennFuture's talented team of environmental advocates this spring, especially regarding renewable energy policy issues in our state.</p><hr /><p>PennFuture's legal and policy team is dedicated to restoring and protecting our environment and communities, to protecting our right to clean air and pure water, and to moving Pennsylvania toward a clean energy future. I thank our amazing staff and interns for their great work, and also our members for your continued support. We can't do this without you!</p><p><a href=""/donate"">Please consider joining PennFuture today</a> to support all of the great work we do to protect our environment and hold polluters and our government accountable.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Abigail M.

What We Learned from the December 2022 Deep Freeze: Don’t Rely on Natural Gas When It’s Fracking Cold (Part 2),1/27/2023,"<p><b><i>In our previous article, we explained how Pennsylvania's energy grid became perilously close to a brownout event during last month's winter storm. <a href=""/Blog-Item-What-We-Learned-from-the-December-2022-Deep-Freeze-Dont-Rely-on-Natural-Gas-When-Its-Fracking-Cold-Part-1"">Read part one for a day-by-day breakdown of the chain of events.</a></i></b></p><p>In December, fracked gas and coal plants across the Pennsylvania energy grid failed at rates of significantly higher than the grid operator had anticipated.</p><p>While PJM collects more detailed information on the cause of the 2022 holiday weekend outages, their preliminary data aggregates the causes into a few categories. Most of the outages are reported to have been caused by failed plant equipment, low fuel supply, or start failure and unit trips. Outages in the last category are often a consequence of equipment or fuel issues.</p><p>Fuel supply for gas plants is an <a href=""http://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC_SPOD_11142017_Final.pdf"">on-going concern</a>. An operator must not only purchase sufficient fuel, but they must also have sufficient pipeline capacity for that fuel to be delivered when and where it is needed.</p><p>Gas generators can arrange for sales and delivery with either ""firm"" contracts (where the customer is a high priority) or cheaper ""interruptible"" contracts, where an order can be canceled if someone else is willing to pay more. Preliminary data shows that more than 17 percent of the gas in Pennsylvania <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/"">was acquired</a> through interruptible contracts, meaning many gas power plants would lose their supply when other consumers needed it most.</p><p>Even firm contracts don't insure delivery. Unexpected conditions-like severe winter storms-can result in local gas utilities and gas-fired generation competing for the same supply and pipeline capacity. In those situations, the local utilities normally take priority. That's because, if they lose gas, millions of households will have no other option for heat, not to mention the danger of re-lighting massive numbers of pilot lights. As a result, gas-fired power plants with firm contracts can have the tap turned off. It looks like this may have happened as well.</p><p><i>Fracked Gas is Rightfully Nervous and is Looking to Cast Blame Elsewhere<o:p></o:p></i></p><p>High on the list of industry talking points is the tired claim that environmental protections get in the way of their operations, and, with less oversight and fewer regulations, they could do better-we just need to trust them. Unfortunately for them, there is no evidence this is true.</p><p>Preliminary reports show that only a very small percentage of facilities reached their emissions limits and had to shut down That isn't surprising since section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act already addresses this problem-the Department of Energy allows generators to temporarily exceed their emissions limits or operate contrary to any environmental law or regulation when needed to respond to an emergency. In fact, 202(c) was invoked on the evening of December 24, and PJM reports that several plants were able to operate for a few additional hours because of that order.</p><p>Blaming PJM itself appears to be another popular approach. The fracked gas industry is arguing that the problem was PJM making bad energy forecasts, or PJM notified plants too late to secure the fuel they need.</p><p>PJM admits that, while they historically overestimate demand on holiday weekends, this time they underestimated demand by 10 percent. But, to their credit, they also realized they lacked confidence in the forecast and went into the event with a reserve capacity almost ten times higher than they normally would want. That would have been sufficient but for the shockingly high forced outage rate.</p><p>The lack of timely notification makes even less sense. PJM reported that in 92 percent of cases, generators gave them one hour or less of notice of outages.If these facilities had fuel concerns, they should have reported that to PJM back on December 21 when PJM issued a cold weather alert, and certainly by the time a second alert was issued on December 23.</p><p>After years of claiming the mantle as a ""reliable"" source of energy, it shouldn't be a surprise that the gas industry is quick to point fingers. Rather than hold themselves accountable for failing Pennsylvanians, they're trying to bend reality so that they don't have to pay for their mistakes. But a cold, hard look at the situation proves that the (fracked gas) emperor has no clothes.</p><p><i>What does this mean for Pennsylvania's Energy Future?</i><i><o:p></o:p></i></p><p>Not only does someone need to pay to the energy industries failures during December 2022, but policymakers, grid operators, advocates, and industry need to take a critical look at Pennsylvania's energy grid with an eye to reform.</p><p>But first we must get past the industry hyperbole. The fracked gas industry is already claiming that the solution is more fracking and more pipelines to create even more oversupply. That simply doesn't make any sense. In addition to the obvious environmental and public health consequences of fracking, the economics just don't work. We would need to spend billions of dollars to over-build vast amounts of infrastructure to guard against shortages, likely causing an unsustainable glut in the market outside of these events. Consumers would ultimately pay far higher energy prices to over-frack the Commonwealth with little benefit.</p><p>The real solution is not putting all our eggs in one energy source basket in the first place. If we diversify our generation-particularly away from resource-constrained fossil fuels and towards non-resource constrained clean, renewable energy-we will be less exposed to supply chain risks and mechanical failures. If we also invest in energy efficiency, we can mitigate peak demand so there is less need to over-supply the grid in times of crisis. And, if we expand our capacity for energy storage, we will have more flexibility-and more options-to manage the grid when we need it most.</p><p>Doing all these things requires thoughtful planning and policy, but they are the stalwarts of a modern-day energy system. What the December 2022 energy crisis is teaching us is that Pennsylvania needs to move away from an energy grid steeped in the philosophies of the last century and reflect the needs and technological innovations of today.</p><p><i>Conclusions and Next Steps</i><o:p></o:p></p><p>Each year, billions of dollars of ratepayer money goes to the fracked gas industry in the form of capacity payments in return for their guarantee that they will be available to power the grid when needed. More than 37 percent of our fracked gas plants couldn't run when needed them most. That raises serious concerns as to the reliability of the energy sources we're paying to underpin the grid. A broader rethink of this energy policy is needed immediately.</p><p>But most insidious is how unfair Pennsylvania's energy system has become. It's now dominated by a fracked gas industry propped up by taxpayer subsidies and lax regulations that struggled to keep our lights on. Their failure to live up to their commitments caused energy prices to skyrocket to historic levels. Over time, those costs of these bills-and even the penalties gas generators incurred-will be borne by small businesses, households, and other energy users.</p><p>In other words, we've built a Pennsylvania energy grid where taxpayers are paying for the fracking, the pipelines, and the power plants up front through subsidies, but also paying for the cost of their grid, without mentioning the monumental health and environmental costs throughout the fracking process. It's high time that Pennsylvania rolls up its sleeves and re-thinks its energy policies that have created this unfair grid before the next storm causes real blackouts.<o:p></o:p></p>",Energy,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
What We Learned from the December 2022 Deep Freeze: Don’t Rely on Natural Gas When It’s Fracking Cold (Part 1),1/24/2023,"<p><em>Thisarticle is the first in a two-part series. <a href=""/Blog-Item-What-We-Learned-from-the-December-2022-Deep-Freeze-Dont-Rely-on-Natural-Gas-When-Its-Fracking-Cold-Part-2"">Read Part 2: How Fracked Gas Failed Pennsylvania</a>.</em></p><p>As the 2022 holiday weekend approached, a developing winter storm promised to bring severe cold weather to Pennsylvania. It's in these moments that our infrastructure-particularly our energy grid-is needed most and is stress tested. Unfortunately, our grid staggered, nearly leaving our homes in the cold and dark.</p><p>The 2022 winter storm is an event that should bring a critical eye to Pennsylvania's increasingly gas-reliant energy mix. Otherwise, we will continue the slide towards becoming an expensive energy state, consistently threatened with energy instability wile energy generators are unfairly enriched.<o:p></o:p></p><p><o:p></o:p><strong><u>December 21</u></strong></p><p>With forecasts looking ominous, PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM)-the regional energy grid operator that manages Pennsylvania-issued a Cold Weather Alert.At that time, gas generators should have been alerting PJM if they foresaw problems buying gas on the spot market to support increased consumer demand.<o:p></o:p></p><p>PJM's plan to ensure we have the power we need is to purchase ""capacity"" in addition to energy.The way the system works, generators who clear the capacity auction get paid to be available, whether they are called on to run and sell energy or not. For the 2022delivery year, those payments totaled about $4 billion. Generators who take this money face steep penalties if they are unable to deliver energy when called so, in theory, companies have an incentive to invest in preventative maintenance, winterization, and other measures to improve reliability and be ready when we need them the most-at least, that is the plan.<o:p></o:p></p><p><u><b>December 23</b></u></p><p>PJM's models forecast a need for 127 gigawatts (GW), but there was a lot of uncertainty. Power plants are complicated and, even in normal times, they are unavailable when called upon about 5 percent of the time. This forced outage rate-in other words, the number of power plants not running when they were supposed to-gets higher in extreme weather, climbing to around 10 percent. In addition to worries about forced outages, there is uncertainty predicting the weather and, in this case, uncertainty how demand might change on a holiday weekend. Rather than the 3GW of reserve, back-up capacity that PJM normally considers adequate, the grid operator planned for 29 GW.<o:p></o:p></p><p>Temperatures plummeted, dropping 29 degrees over a 12-hour period-a steeper decline than the historic 2014 polar vortex.With those crashing temperatures, the demand for energy soared, peaking about 10 percent higher than the forecast of 139 GW. The 29 GW of reserve capacity should have been more than enough to cover the demand-if the planned capacity could deliver. Unfortunately, the forced outage rate started to rise.<o:p></o:p></p><p>Early in the morning on Friday, December 23, there were about 12 GW of forced outages. By late Friday night, that climbed to 34 GW. <o:p></o:p></p><p><u><b>December 24</b></u></p><p>Forced outages peaked at 46 GW. Failures not only included the ""expected"" 10 percent of generators that PJM called to run; over 23 percent of PJM's total capacity was unavailable. Worse yet, PJM had little or no notice these plants couldn't run-in 92 percent of cases, they had less than one-hours' notice and, in some cases, no notice at all.<o:p></o:p></p><p>PJM resorted to a suite of emergency procedures. Most glaring to the average Pennsylvanian were the reports on the news that households were asked to ""voluntarily"" reduce electricity on Christmas Day. PJM was also calling up idling synchronized reserve generators, issuing voltage reduction warnings, and obtaining permission for plants to exceed their emissions limitations, if they had to. PJM even became a net importer of power for a period, relying on neighboring grids to fill in supply gaps. By and large, the lights stayed on, if just barely, but it came at a staggering cost.<o:p></o:p></p><p>With demand outstripping supply, the costs to consumers soared. Wholesale prices for energy vary, but they are generally under $50 a megawatt-hour (MWh) and often under $30/MWh.For comparison, average retail electric prices (which includes local utility charges) were about $100/MWh in PA in 2021.During this event, PJM saw wholesale prices for energy peak at $4,300/MWh-essentially as high as the system is designed to go.<o:p></o:p></p><p>What this means is that energy purchased by utility companies during the holiday weekend were paying up to 1,000 percent more for that energy than normal-a cost that will certainly be borne by consumers in some way.<o:p></o:p></p><p><strong>What went wrong?</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p>PJM is expected to issue a full report in mid-April, but preliminary data shows that about 70 percent of the forced outages came from fracked gas plants not operating like they should have . Gas makes up about 50 percent of PJM's generation with over 86 GW installed. At the peak of the crisis on December 24, its forced outage rate was over 37 percent with over 32 GW offline.<o:p></o:p></p><p>Coal was having problems, too, with a forced outage rate of about 16 percent (7.5GW).While the industry touts itself as ""fuel-secure"" because piles of coal often sit at the plant and they don't rely on pipelines, they still contend with frozen coal piles, supply-chain issues, and maintenance problems at decades-old plants that cause more than their share of outages.<o:p></o:p></p><p>PJM's ""other"" category, which includes nuclear power and renewables, performed largely as expected with a forced outage rate of about 10 percent.In fact, when the data is in, we expect it to show that wind generation performed far better than what PJM had planned.<o:p></o:p></p><p>Claims that fracked gas is a reliable energy source have been circulating for years and, even as recently as 2017, PJM itself <a href=""http://www.pjm.com/~/media/library/reports-notices/special-reports/20170330-pjms-evolving-resource-mix-and-system-reliability.ashx"" target=""_blank"">suggested</a> that as much as 86 percent gas-fired generation on our grid could maintain reliability.Hypotheticals aside, in December 2022 fracked gas wasn't reliable when we needed it, and consumers ended up paying steep costsfor that failure.The key question is why.</p><p><a href=""/Blog-Item-What-We-Learned-from-the-December-2022-Deep-Freeze-Dont-Rely-on-Natural-Gas-When-Its-Fracking-Cold-Part-2""><i>Read Part 2: How Fracked Gas Failed Pennsylvania.</i></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p><p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></p><div><div><div id=""_com_5"" language=""JavaScript""><!--[if !supportAnnotations]--></div><!--[endif]--></div></div>",Energy,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
PennFuture and Partners Pave the Way for Erie Environmental Advisory Council,1/6/2023,"<p>After more than a year of advocacy by PennFuture and our partners, Erie City Council this week passed an ordinance creating an <a href=""https://weconservepa.org/eac/eac-basics/"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Advisory Council (EAC)</a>.</p><p>The second municipality to develop an active EAC in Northwest Pennsylvania, Erie's EAC will build capacity and support community outreach efforts at a time of growing environmental ambitions.</p><p><strong>What is an EAC?</strong></p><p>EACs are extensions of municipal governments that focus on environmental conservation and improvement. They provide increased capacity for municipalities to protect their natural resources, communicate with the public, and meet their environmental goals.</p><p>Pennsylvania Act 148 of 1973 authorized municipalities to create EACs via ordinance and the model has proven successful. In fact, Erie is now home to the <a href=""https://weconservepa.org/groups/"" target=""_blank"">161<sup>st</sup> EAC in the Commonwealth</a>.</p><p>EACs do not make regulatory decisions nor are they independent environmental advisory organizations. They function most effectively when working cooperatively with elected officials, staff, and other authorities and boards.</p><p>EACs are comprised of seven voting members that must be municipal residents. Members must have expertise in environmental matters, and they serve three-year terms with staggered initial appointments.</p><p><strong>Why is an EAC important for the City of Erie?</strong></p><p>The City of Erie is working to reinvent itself by attracting 21st century businesses and bringing people, especially young people, to work, live, and play in the city. Many in the city are also working to address racial inequities and high poverty rates. Today's young adults seek sustainable and socially aware cities where they feel their voices can be heard.</p><p>Recent efforts by Mayor Joseph Schember to achieve this future include<a href=""https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/consultant-recommends-city-of-erie-hire-full-time-dei-coordinator-create-diversity-team/ar-AA14fiFw"" target=""_blank""> hiring a diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice consultant</a>; <a href=""https://www.yourerie.com/news/local-news/solar-panels-added-to-erie-central-fire-station/"" target=""_blank"">installing solar panels on the city's fire station</a>; and committing to the city's first <a href=""https://pennwatch.org/dep-and-local-officials-kick-off-2022-23-local-climate-action-program/"" target=""_blank"">climate </a>and <a href=""https://www.fundersnetwork.org/nine-communities-receive-partners-for-places-mini-grants/"" target=""_blank"">environmental justice</a> planning processes.</p><p>However, Erie will need more capacity and resources to meet its goals of becoming a more sustainable city. A well-functioning EAC that works with government is a low-cost way to expand the city's capacity to reach this goal. In addition to advising city departments on environmental matters, an EAC can expand outreach to Erie residents, especially when planning and decision-making will impact them. This increased public involvement will go far to bring residents to the table and to elevate their voices - two important aspects for addressing injustice.</p><p>Mayor Schember stated a desire to create a body to advise him on climate and environmental matters in his first term. Environmental groups supported this but recognized an opportunity to implement a model that could transcend any one administration. In alignment with <a href=""/Files/Admin/ErieCommonAgenda_6.pdf""><em>Our Water, Our Future: A Common Agenda for Protecting Pennsylvania's Lake Erie Watershed</em></a>, a codified EAC was recommended that would be much more difficult for a future administration to dismantle.</p><p><strong>What actions led to EAC ordinance passage?</strong></p><p>Mayor Schember and City Sustainability Coordinator Sarah Peelman welcomed the input of PennFuture and our partners, based on the Common Agenda. As a result, the following individuals embarked on a campaign to create a City of Erie EAC:</p><p><img src=""/Files/Images/EAC-List-Test-2.PNG"" /></p><p>The team researched best practices and met with several existing EACs before providing a proposal to the Mayor and City Council President. This proposal included a 12-step ""roadmap"" for Erie EAC creation. Recommended action included interagency and community outreach. The group then drafted an EAC ordinance based on examples from other cities and submitted this to the Mayor, City Council, and the City Solicitor for review.</p><p>PennFuture is thankful for the support of the mayor and City Council. Still, passing the EAC ordinance was not without its challenges.</p><p>The final ordinance included language that requires the EAC only research and focus on those initiatives dictated by the mayor and City Council. However, the first power EACs hold, as outlined in the state governing legislation, is to ""identify environmental problems and recommend plans and programs…"".</p><p>If the EAC is unable to study additional issues, the council would be left vulnerable to individual interests of elected officials, rather than be accountable to needs of the community.</p><p>EACs that our partnership consulted maintain a cooperative working relationship with elected officials, but the council leaders are trusted as experts, left to conduct public outreach, identify issues, and make recommendations accordingly. Leaders can then choose whether to act upon those recommendations.</p><p>PennFuture and our partners chose to support the final ordinance language because we believe qualified EAC appointees will gain the trust of leaders. However, if political threats arise, we will defend the rightful duties of the EAC.</p><p><strong>What are the next steps for the Erie EAC?</strong></p><p>It is vitally important that the city receive diverse, passionate, and qualified applicants to serve on the EAC. Four appointments will be made by Council and three by the mayor.</p><p>If you are a qualified resident of the City of Erie, apply to serve! Encourage friends and colleagues to apply too! <a href=""mailto:tompkins@pennfuture.org"">Please reach out to Erie Campaign Manager Jenny Tompkins</a> if you would like additional information.</p><p>Passage of the EAC ordinance was made possible by months of collaborative educational and outreach efforts. It is the hope that this initial work of the advocacy team will provide a foundation for new EAC members to build from. The EAC framework, now implemented by 160 communities, has the potential to provide great benefit to the City of Erie and its residents. Erie's leaders must give it space to do so.</p><p><em>Photo courtesy Doug Kerr</em></p>",Community; Environment,"Jenny Tompkins, Campaign Manager for Clean Water Advocacy"
