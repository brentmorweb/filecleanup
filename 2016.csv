Pittlandia: Is Pittsburgh the New Portland?,12/22/2016,"<p>We've all seen the articles. They have titles like, ""Pittsburgh: The New Portland"" or ""Portland is Over: All the Cool Kids are Moving to Pittsburgh."" So, is it true?</p><p>Pittsburgh and Portland are constantly being compared as the numbers of microbreweries and organic food markets in each increase, while they were once primarily known for industrial pasts. But in my humble opinion, the articles miss a crucial factor: <strong>how do they compare in terms of their respective environmental agendas?</strong></p><p>As a native Pittsburgher who recently visited Portland for the first time, and with my current position at PennFuture, I could not help but compare the two through my own research and first-hand observations.<br /><br /> Let's start by comparing air quality. The American Lung Association's 2016 State of the Air Report shows the following:</p><p><strong> High Ozone Days Particle Pollution Total Population at Risk<br /> Pittsburgh </strong>F F 1,231,255<br /><strong>Portland </strong>B C 776,712</p><p>This chart is very representative of what I experience on a day-to-day basis in Pittsburgh and also represents what I experienced on my week-long vacation in Portland. With high asthma rates, it's no surprise Pittsburgh ranks in the dirtiest 15 percent of U.S. cities, while Portland is in the 78.7 percent of the cleanest cities. Spending a day hiking in Eagle Creek, Oregon was such a unique experience due to that fresh, clean air-something that people all over the United States should not have to travel 2,500 miles to experience.</p><p>So, why is our air not as clean? While Portland has taken a proactive stance on developing sustainable urban design and combatting climate change, Pittsburgh is just starting to follow suit. Here are some examples:</p><h2>Bicycling</h2><p>Portland is a founding member of the Cities for Cycling initiative, which includes traffic engineers and planners from some of the best bicycling cities sharing information and developing a national urban bicycle design guide. According to its 2030 plan, the group hopes to implement an expansion of intersection bike boxes, improve signal infrastructure by installing bicycle detection in bicycle lanes, and consistently improve bike lanes. The city has also provided bicycle parking in commercial areas known as ""bicycle corrals.""</p><p>Perhaps the most fascinating part of my trip occurred as my friend and I walked downtown, where we witnessed nearly every car yield to pedestrians and bicyclists due to the Oregon Pedestrian right-of-way laws. It really was like a Portlandia episode.</p><p>Pittsburgh has a few more hurdles when it comes to biking. We have a more drastic winter season (as opposed to Portland's two seasons: dry or wet) and a lot more hills. However, despite these setbacks, the bike scene is really picking up due to advocacy groups like Bike Pgh! With the group's hard work, Pittsburgh City Council recently approved the Mayor's Complete Streets Policy, which states, ""Everybody, regardless of who they are, where they live, or how they get around, should have the choice to travel in a safe and convenient manner.""</p><p>In addition to this ordinance, Pittsburgh now has 50 Healthy Ride bike stations, released a report on pedestrian and bicycling safety in Pittsburgh, and teaches nearly 1,500 youth and adults on safe riding skills.</p><h2>Climate Action Plan</h2><p>The City of Pittsburgh, using the Portland model, is currently looking into identifying two to three neighborhoods to serve as Pittsburgh pilots that have high cycling activity, in which they can install bike racks in strategically identified parking spots and monitor the effectiveness of the program as part of the Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan.</p><p>The Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan outlines the measures that government, businesses, higher education institutions, and citizens of the City of Pittsburgh have begun and can continue to undertake to help mitigate the local effects of global climate change. It's created by the Pittsburgh Climate Initiative, which is a collaborative involving city and county government, non-profits (like PennFuture), higher education, and the business community.</p><p>As we enter 2017, the third edition of the Climate Action Plan will be released, with Portland's Climate Action Plan as its chief model. For example, in Portland, there is a ""FAR Bonus Program"" that offers a Floor Area Ratio Bonus in its building code.</p><p>With this program, developers may build an extra 3 feet x 2 per foot of green roof they construct without obtaining additional permits. There is also a reimbursement of up to $5 per square foot on green roofs, because they are storm water-reducing infrastructure.</p><p>Pittsburgh plans to use this strategy by building off of the existing URA Pittsburgh Home Rehabilitation Program loan program for low-income households, exploring clean energy bonds through the Federal government, establishing a pilot limited to a certain number of homes and businesses, and communicating results with private lending institutions to encourage energy efficiency financing options. This is just one of many examples of how Pittsburgh could follow Portland's footsteps on climate change.</p><p><strong>We know this kind of change can happen, even in a city like Pittsburgh. </strong>For instance, this past October, Pittsburgh became the 17th city to adopt a legislated building benchmarking ordinance that requires commercial buildings 50,000 square feet and over to disclose energy and water usage in order to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions.</p><p>Although this was also modeled after Portland's energy benchmarking policy that is a little more ambitious (requiring commercial buildings 20,000 square feet and over), Pittsburgh is using Portland as its model to continuously work to become a better, greener Pittsburgh.</p><p><strong>With this in mind, we can hopefully have a cleaner, healthier future in store.</strong></p>",Climate; Energy; Environment,"Annie Regan, Senior Program Manager"

Taking Stock of the 2015-16 Legislative Session </br> Historic Attacks and Lost Opportunities,11/21/2016,"The Pennsylvania General Assembly's two-year session wrapped up with a flurry of last-minute activity, capping off months of historic attacks on environmental priorities. It was a tumultuous session characterized by numerous attempts to weaken environmental regulations, halt progress toward a clean energy economy, and open up more land to natural resource extraction.<br /><br /> PennFuture worked tirelessly to defend the Commonwealth against these attacks and strengthen natural gas drilling regulation, protect endangered species, promote energy conservation, and advance Pennsylvania's opportunity to develop a timely carbon reduction strategy. The fight is not over though. Many of the bills described below are expected to be re-introduced during next session, which begins January 2017.<br /><br /> Nevertheless, here's a rundown of the session's environmental wins, narrow escapes, lost opportunities and losses.<br /><br /><u><strong>Wins</strong></u><ul><li>Defeated attempt to commercialize state park lands (HB 2013). This bill would have advanced efforts to open up state parks to private developers to build hotels, golf courses, amusement parks, commercial and industrial parks and other uses incompatible with our state parks' natural assets. It was soundly defeated in the House.</li><li>Defeated effort to ban municipalities from addressing plastic bag pollution (HB 1280). This last-minute bill would have banned local municipalities from banning of levying fees on plastic bags, which account for a significant portion of water pollution and litter issues. It was soundly defeated in the House.</li></ul><br /><u><strong>Narrow Escapes</strong></u><ul><li>Senate advanced legislation to gut energy efficiency program (SB 850). This legislation was pressed as a commonsense effort to make manufacturing more competitive, but in fact it was a veiled attempt to allow the largest state industries to avoid paying their fair share for energy conservation programs, resulting in far less investment in this cost-effective program. It passed the Senate, but did not receive a vote in the House.</li><li>House and Senate almost broke the state building code process...again (HB 568). This controversial legislation would have locked in a failed process that has disallowed Pennsylvania from adopting modern building codes, include strong energy conservation standards. It passed the Senate, was amended by the House and passed, and amended again and passed by the Senate. The House never took final action.</li><li>Governor vetoes attempt to break state regulatory process (SB 562). This seemingly innocuous bill would have given the legislature the power to indefinitely delay new regulations, potentially killing new proposed environmental safeguards. Both the House and the Senate passed it, but Governor Wolf issued a veto..</li></ul><br /><u><strong>Lost Opportunities</strong></u><ul><li>Bad amendments taint good gas royalty bill (HB 1391). Rep. Everett pushed for good legislation to require gas drillers to pay landowners who lease their land for drilling the full amount they owe in royalty payments, yet numerous amendments aimed at weakening new gas drilling regulations and barring methane regulations set the stage for unnecessary legislative battles around a good bill. It ultimately did not come up for a vote in the House.</li><li>Effort to rollback endangered species protections sinks good government bills (SB 1166 and SB 1168). This pair of bills would have allowed the Fish and Boat and Game Commissions to set license fees and better fund their programs. Unfortunately, amendments were offered in the House that would have weakened protection for endangered species. The bills passed without amendments in the Senate, but did not receive votes in the House.</li></ul><br /><u><strong>Losses</strong></u><ul><li>Creating an environmental regulation hit list (SR 385). Senate Resolution 385 directs the Joint State Government Commission to conduct an unnecessary review of environmental laws and regulations to determine if they are more protective than federal laws. Once identified, the study will provide convenient cover to roll back laws designed to address environmental threats specific to Pennsylvania. It passed overwhelmingly in the Senate (Note, resolutions only have to pass their respective chamber and don't require gubernatorial approval).</li><li>Delaying state planning to reduce carbon pollution (SB 1195). This hotly contested bill implements a convoluted process that all, but guarantees Pennsylvania will wait until the very last minute to submit its plan to reduce carbon pollution by 30% by 2030 under the Clean Power Plan. The bill passed both the House and Senate. Governor Wolf signed it into law.</li><li>Halting new rules for conventional oil and gas drilling (SB 279). After 5 years of public input, legislative input, and policy debate the General Assembly advanced legislation to stop new rules for conventional oil and gas drilling from taking effect. These rules would have set commonsense standards to protect water, communities, and air from a polluting industry that has been working under the same regulations for over 30 years without updating. The bill passed the House and Senate. Governor Wolf signed it into law.</li></ul>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,PennFuture
What a Trump presidency means for our environment and future generations.,11/17/2016,"<h3>Whats Next for Pennsylvania?</h3><p>It's the morning after and we are all wondering what is next? It is a very dark place for the environment and I will not try to put varnish on it. President-elect Trump has promised to abolish EPA, to appoint climate deniers to key posts to retreat on environmental regulations, renege on the Paris Accord, and dismantle the efforts to advance clean power and bring back coal. Trump will have the House, Senate and Supreme Court on his side, so with a unified Republican government, his words will not come back empty.<br /><br /> The environment lost the biggest battle imaginable and the worst part of that is these urgent issues were rarely if ever mentioned. Greenland is in full-scale melt, the Arctic is moving to a complete summer melt and the earth is setting record-breaking temperatures now spewing its own carbon dioxide and methane. In the face of this and while watching the rapid expansion of frack gas, pipelines and generation infrastructure, there was not a single environmental or climate question in the debates. The media has utterly failed to address environmental threats.<br /><br /> In the face of Citizen's United, gerrymandering and massive amounts of dark money, the environmental community has largely failed to restructure itself to be able to be actively engage politically to add our voice to the debate. In that vacuum, major donors moved into the state, created their own structures, spent millions creating incompetent and ineffective grassroots while we were left sitting on the sidelines. We must own that and make this moment a turning point.<br /><br /> While Hillary Clinton gave one good speech in Florida and mentioned the climate from time to time, neither candidate really made protecting our environment a pivotal National issue. At the state level, I understand we lost our best friend Representative Leanne Krueger-Braneky and Katie McGinty went down in the most expensive Senatorial election in American history. The process has utterly failed and the majority of American voters have failed our children and their future.<br /><br /> On a personal level it is extremely distressing. Once again, I just shake my head at the enormous mistake that American voters made yesterday as I consider my grandchildren's future. I have been fighting for progress on climate for most of my career and I have experienced repeated legislative failures starting with the BTU tax in 1993. Looking forward and we must do that, we need to be careful not to be Pollyanna or even reassuring. This is kick in the worst place possible and we all need to search within ourselves, within our community and decide how we move forward in the days ahead.<br /><br /> I am reminded of what General U. S. Grant did after a brutal defeat at both Shiloh and at Wilderness. Grant did not retreat, as other Generals urged him to do, instead he attacked. In the face of daunting and almost impossible odds I dust myself off and together we must march forward.<br /><br /> The fight is not over, attack we must.<br /><br /> Larry<br /><br /><br /> Larry J.

The Paris Climate Accord: Too Little Too Late or an Important First Step?,11/16/2016,"After 21 painful years of negotiations following the sabotaged Kyoto Climate Agreement, 191 countries finally found agreement on a new strategy to confront climate change and agreed to the Paris Climate Accord last December. Since then, the Paris Accord has been ratified by 82 nations with sufficient emissions to trigger the early launch of the Accord. It finally took effect on November 4th.<br /><br /> The goals of the Accord are to reduce greenhouse emissions, help countries adapt to wrenching changes brought about by a warming climate and finance projects in developing nations that repair damage wrought by climate change. The explicit goal is for all nations to work together to hold global average temperature increases to well below 3.6 °F (2 °C) above pre-industrial levels in an effort to avoid the vast damages caused by dangerous climate change.<br /><br /> President-elect Trump has vowed to pull the United States out of this historic agreement, and rescind the Clean Power Plan that requires coal-fired power plants to cut carbon pollution. That would be a tragedy for our country and our families. It would also be a huge lost opportunity to capitalize on the economic advantages of leading the transition to safe, clean energy.<br /><br /> Pennsylvania has a significant responsibility to cut carbon pollution. As the third largest carbon emitter in the nation, Pennsylvania produces about 2 days of the year's worldwide total emissions. But Pennsylvania has much to gain from aggressively pursuing efforts to cut carbon emissions by committing to an ambitious effort to clean up our energy production by investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency.<br /><br /> Pennsylvania already has 66,000 people working in clean energy industries - more than those employed in the coal and gas industries combined. With the right mix of state policies including strengthening our renewable energy and energy efficiency standards, giving renewable energy full access to the electricity grid, and fairly paying homeowners for the excess power they generate from rooftop solar power plants, we could significantly increase the jobs and the economic impact of clean energy.<br /><br /> But right now, that's not the path our misdirected state legislature is taking. Under the influence of the shale gas and coal interests, the legislature has repeatedly tied the hands of the Wolf administration and the DEP to work on a rational climate plan or increase our renewable energy standards. They have attempted to significantly weaken our successful energy conservation program.<br /><br /> Pennsylvania clearly risks heading down a blind alley by investing in the wrong energy path promising enormous risks and stranded fossil fuel assets. There are 32 additional gas-powered plants proposed for Pennsylvania in various stages of consideration, development, and construction. The planning assumption going into these new plants is not based on growing urgency for constraining carbon emissions but is based solely on sufficient recoverable gas reserves and traditional capitalization considerations over the expected lifetime of new gas combustion turbines up to about 60 years. These assets along with the new pipelines, compressor stations and other gas appurtenances will not be viable in short order as we approach climate tipping points.<br /><br /> The stakes could not be higher. Thirty-one highly respected American scientific organizations recently came together to warn Congress: ""If we are to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change, emissions of greenhouse gasses must be dramatically reduced. In addition, adaptation will be necessary to address those impacts that are already unavoidable."" The well-known former director of NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Jim Hansen has gone so far as to warn, ""2 degrees of warming is actually a prescription for long-term disaster"".<br /><br /> The Paris Accord is an important first step to move 191 nations in the direction of addressing our common future to avoid a long and growing list of catastrophic climate consequences. The Clean Power Plan offers a specific way forward, and Pennsylvania is in an enviable position to capitalize on the new economic development that a transition to clean energy offers. Working together we can and we must do our part as responsible stewards. To walk away from this vital work is both immoral and stupid.",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,Larry J. Schweiger
Defending Net Metering in Pennsylvania,11/7/2016,"<h2>Customers who generate their own clean energy deserve a fair price.</h2> When customers choose to install solar panels, they not only take control of their own energy spending and help produce clean renewable energy, they help their neighbors as well. Every new kilowatt-hour (kWh) of clean energy on the grid means less pollution and the lower demand means wholesale prices are lower too. <br /><br /> Before our state Legislature passed the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) act in 2004, customers could install solar panels, but there was no guarantee they would get a fair price if they sold <img>their extra power back to their utility. AEPS changed that by allowing net metering of energy. Now, when you generate more electricity than you use, the law requires the utility to pay you the full retail value of what you generate. For residential customers that averages around $.13 per kWh.<br /><br /> In Pennsylvania, and in many other states, net metering programs are under attack with the claim that paying anyone more than the wholesale cost of generation is unfair. This is disingenuous. The actual value of solar is far higher than the wholesale cost of generation. Only paying the wholesale cost of generation means that utilities avoid all transmission costs, congestion pricing and other factors that can drive the actual price of power on the spot market far higher. This means paying customer generators as little as $.03 per kWh at times when the market price could spike as high as $1.00 per kWh.<br /><br /> Attempts to end net metering entirely have, so far, not gained traction in Pennsylvania, but in February of 2014, the Public Utility Commission (PUC) begun the process of passing new regulations that create additional restrictions.<br /><br /> PennFuture has worked with a coalition of solar industry representatives, environmental groups, and interested citizens to fight this rulemaking and we've been successful and preventing some of the worst provisions from moving forward. After hearing from the PUC and the opposition, the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) voted unanimously to disapprove of the rulemaking on two separate occasions. This led the PUC to drop plans to cap the size of net metered systems, but problems still remain with the PUC's approach.<br /><br /> As a result of the final rule, we may see utilities seek new fees on customer generators and people may be denied interconnection in situations that the legislation allows. Should that occur, the fight to defend net metering will have to be taken to the courts.",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
