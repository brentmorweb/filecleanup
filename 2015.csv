Waste Coal: Time to finish what we started.,11/18/2015,"<h2>Alternatives to Waste Coal Plants</h2>

<p><br />
Even if we keep our waste coal plants on line, there is still a significant amount of waste ash that must be disposed of. Some have suggested planting beach grass to stabilize the pile and prevent leaching into the ground water. Planting beach grass on waste coal piles is a much cheaper option than building more waste coal plants and has been shown to bring life back to long-dead waste coal piles for only 6-10 percent of the cost of conventional methods. Within a few years, beach grass can enable native plants to take over, allow organic matter to accumulate around plants, and form a plant layer that prevents erosion, holds water, cools the surface, and looks a lot better. <br />
<br />
While beach grass is a promising alternative that could be much cheaper than more traditional forms of reclamation, it would still be an expensive undertaking to plant on piles across the state. Waste coal plants are certainly not free either, but they have a perceived advantage in that their costs do not usually show up as line items in the state budget. Even so, as you will see below, waste coal plants do receive a significant amount of benefits from the state.</p>

<h2><br />
Laws and Tax Credits for Waste Coal</h2>

<p><br />
Believe it or not, in Pennsylvania, waste coal is considered to be an alternative source of energy. Under the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act (AEPS), electricity derived from waste coal (16.5 percent) is considered a Tier II resource. Check out Achieving 100 percent Renewable Energy IS Possible and Smog and Mirrors in West Virginia for background on PA&rsquo;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS).<br />
<br />
Having waste coal as a Tier II source was meant to encourage the use of waste coal, but it has not had much of a benefit considering that Tier II credits traded at an average of only $0.13 per MWh in 2013/2014, even lower than the $0.22 per MWh for which it traded during the 2012/2013 auction. (Compare that to $9.78 for Tier I and $94.39 for solar PV in 2013/2014.)<br />
<br />
Waste coal qualifies for the Alternative Energy Production Tax Credit (to date, no tax credits from this program have been earned, $0 was spent on these tax credits in 2012-2013, and $10 million was projected for 2013-2014), the Coal Waste Removal and Ultraclean Fuels Tax Credit (can be used against sales and use tax, corporate net income tax and capital stock/foreign franchise tax), and the Alternative Fuel Incentive Grants (in September, DEP awarded $1.8 million in AFIG funding to four innovative alternative fuel technology projects but it&rsquo;s not clear how much, if any, went to waste coal).<br />
<br />
The two U.S. Senators for Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey (R) and Bob Casey (D), introduced an<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-amendment/41/text"" target=""_blank""> amendment </a>(which fell short by six votes and was rejected by the Senate on Jan. 21) to the Keystone XL pipeline legislation that would exempt waste coal power plants from complying with the smog and soot limits in the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the acid gas and sulfur dioxide pollution limits in the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). The purpose of the amendment was, &ldquo;To continue cleaning up fields and streams while protecting neighborhoods, generating affordable energy, and creating jobs.&rdquo; (Notice how they dont mention cleaning up the air in the purpose statement and that the two rules apply to air pollution.) It is also important to note that even though their amendment was rejected, they could still introduce it as a standalone bill.<br />
<br />
Our senators are not alone in their requests. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has asked for exemptions for waste coal from the Clean Power Plan, Boiler MACT and, likely, other rules. Electric generators who burn waste coal are also asking regulators to weigh their environmental benefits against their environmental harms and count their carbon emissions as zero.</p>

<h2><br />
Transparency</h2>

<p><br />
Deciding whether to accept more pollution in one area (air or water) in order to remove pollution elsewhere (water or air) will be difficult. Rather than continuing the practice of providing incentives to waste coal plants, we need to stop and evaluate the alternatives. While contemplating alternatives, as PennFuture recommended in our policy document &ldquo;<a href=""/Files/Admin/GovWolfPolicyRecommendations%5F201501%2Epdf"" target=""_blank"">A Fresh Start for Pennsylvania: 26 Steps that Governor Wolf can take to improve Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and economy</a>&rdquo; and as DEP Acting Secretary John Quigley has stated on numerous occasions, <strong>DEP needs to be transparent about its decision-making. </strong><br />
<br />
If more waste coal plants are to be built, DEP should provide detailed analysis relating to the potential impacts to the air in the surrounding communities and request comments concerning its proposal. And if they decide to let the waste coal piles be, then they need to carefully monitor the nearby water supply and keep local citizens up to date on their findings. Or even if they decide its best to use beach grass or other alternative measures to tackle the problem, we need to know what those measures are and if/how they are working. <br />
<br />
Whatever steps DEP takes to handle our waste coal problem, they need to be open and honest about it. It is of utmost importance that we are informed about decisions impacting our air and water. As stated in my previous blog post, we have a constitutional right to clean air and clean water in Pennsylvania.<br />

Governor's budget and the solar saw-buck,5/15/2015,"Every year, the<a href=""http://pre.thesolarfoundation.org/solarstates/pennsylvania"" target=""_blank""> Solar Jobs census</a> is released and every year, I write a blog about how Pennsylvania has fallen behind other states. Here we go... For the 2014 Solar Jobs Census, we are now 15th in the nation, with only about 2,800 employed in the solar industry in Pennsylvania. Since 2012, when we were fifth in the nation for solar jobs, ten other states have moved ahead of us. Yep, weve lost about 1,800 solar jobs since 2012 and our neighbors, New Jersey and New York, rank in the top five nationally. Okay, now the good news: This year, the jobs report was released at about the same time Gov. Tom Wolf issued his 2015/2016 budget proposal, where solar silver linings abound.<br />
<br />
Gov. Wolf&rsquo;s proposal is to direct $50 million to the successful Pennsylvania Sunshine Rebate program. This should be welcome news to renewable energy boosters and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar industry. <img  class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/CEW%5F222%2Epng"" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;"" />From 2009 through the end of 2013, this program distributed over $103 million in solar rebates to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s residential and commercial sector. The distribution of these funds resulted in over half a billion dollars in immediate economic activity for the state and continues to pay dividends in the form of energy savings for the over 7,000 homeowners and businesses who took advantage of the program.<br />
<br />
Because costs for solar have declined overall, the allocation of $50 million in additional funds could result in the installation of 11,000-18,000 solar projects for the state.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Avoiding a boom and bust:</strong> It is important to recognize that Pennsylvanias solar industry has endured several boom-bust cycles over the last several years. Due to the declining cost of solar and pent-up demand, $50 million may go fast, creating another such boom and bust. Steps should be taken to analyze and modify program parameters and rebate levels so that the program has the greatest potential to spur the development of the maximal volume of new installations. The last incentive level offered by the program was $.75 per watt with maximum rebates per project set at $7,500 for residential and $52,000 for commercial installations. Both the per-watt rebate amount and the overall project cap may deserve reconsideration.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The need for financing:</strong> Although the risk of financing solar has <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/toddwoody/2013/01/25/solar-crowdfunding-startup-lets-ordinary-investors-own-a-piece-of-the-sun/&amp;refURL=http://pfenergycenter.blogspot.com/2015/03/governors-budget-and-solar-saw-buck.html&amp;referrer=http://pfenergycenter.blogspot.com/2015/03/governors-budget-and-solar-saw-buck.html"" target=""_blank"">proven to be low</a>, consumer and commercial solar loan products are scarce, especially in Pennsylvania. States like New York and <a href=""http://www.energizect.com/your-home/solutions-list/smarte"" target=""_blank"">Connecticut</a>have hedged their own funds to back loan programs that offer competitive rates for solar energy to make up for the lack of private equity. Pennsylvania should follow suit. The Governors budget proposes $100 million in &quot;Alternative Energy&quot; funding, the details of which have not yet been announced. Renewable energy advocates should hope that the development of financing is part of the plan.<br />
<br />
Financing support for solar energy may be as important, or even more important, in the long term then the revitalization of the PA Sunshine program alone. And the concept is not new to Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania Treasury has backed energy efficiency improvements for homeowners through the Keystone HELP program since 2009 and may be well positioned to offer a solar loan product if the right funding reserves are made available.<br />
<br />
The Governors budget, if enacted, has the potential to turn the years of bad news that came with the release of the annual solar jobs census into something of which we can be proud once more. Renewable energy boosters should voice their support for the budget while challenging the office to make smart choices and do more to avoid the bust cycle of the past.<br />

PA streams: Let's protect the best of the best.,4/29/2015,"Anyone who spends time in the outdoors knows Pennsylvania has abundant water resources. With more than 86,000 miles of streams, we&rsquo;re second only to Alaska in the number of miles of streams. Although many thousands of these stream miles are polluted by a variety of sources, we are fortunate to find other rivers and streams in excellent health, capable of supporting a variety of fish and other aquatic life. The rivers and streams with the most outstanding water quality are afforded the greatest degree of protection, and are designated High Quality (HQ) or Exceptional Value (EV).<br />
<br />
Pennsylvania has a detailed process for protecting the existing use and designated uses of all HQ and EV waters. The public may petition the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to upgrade a stream to HQ or EV if sufficient data exist to support the request, and partner agencies such as the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission may do the same. The DEP regional office may also make a recommendation for a stream re-designation. Ultimately, all streams proposed for re-designation must be approved by the Pennsylvania Environmental Quality Board (<a href=""http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/Environmental_Quality_Board/21511"" target=""_blank"">EQB</a>).<br />
<br />
Protecting streams through anti-degradation policies and <strong>ensuring that streams have the appropriate regulatory designation prior to permitting development activities</strong> within the watershed is critical to protecting the high quality of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s water resources, for today and for the future.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, t<strong>he DEP has not proposed any stream re-designations to the EQB since September 2011.</strong> Since then, hundreds of miles of streams have been petitioned for upgrade with no formal action by the DEP to re-designate these streams and apply regulatory protections, mainly due to very limited staff.<br />
<br />
To remedy this, we recommend that Gov. Tom Wolf ensure that the DEP has adequate staff resources to ensure that streams receive appropriate stream designation under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.
<ul>
	<li>The DEP should have adequate staff designated: 1) to review stream re-designation petitions submitted by the public and by partner agencies, and 2) to conduct stream surveys to determine appropriate regulatory designations.</li>
	<li>The DEP should revise and streamline its internal process for reviewing stream re-designation petitions.</li>
	<li>The DEP should respond to petitions for stream re-designations in a timely fashion and propose rulemaking packages to upgrade or downgrade streams to the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) at least three times per year.</li>
</ul>
<br />
This recommendation, along with many others, can be found in a recent PennFuture report that highlights actions Gov. Tom Wolf and his administration can take to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment.<br />
