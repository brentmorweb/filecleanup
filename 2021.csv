Looking Ahead to the Best and Worst of 2022’s Legislative Proposals,12/30/2021,"<p>At a time of unprecedented environmental, economic and public health concerns, now is a time when Pennsylvania's legislators should be developing common-sense solutions.</p><p>The General Assembly is unfortunately not known for being the most solutions-oriented of the country's legislative bodies. That said, the most recent legislative session does give us some reason for optimism in 2022.</p><p>Here is our roundup of the best - and the worst - of the bills expected to make their way through the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 2022.</p><p><strong><u>The Good</u></strong></p><ul><li>Clean Water Funding</li></ul><p>With thousands of miles of impaired waterways flowing across the state, it is imperative that Pennsylvania dedicates more funding toward conservation, pollution remediation, and agricultural best practices. The American Rescue Plan offers a rare chance to do just that, providing potentially millions of dollars in untapped funding.</p><p>But first the General Assembly needs to enable state agencies to use ARP funds toward clean-water projects. SB 525 would create a Growing Greener III program and infuse $500 million from ARP funds. Separately, HB 1901 proposes a new Clean Streams Fund that would dedicate resources to improve water quality by reducing agricultural runoff, acid mine drainage, and stormwater pollution across the state. HB 1901 would allocate an additional $250 million in ARP funds.</p><p>With the Farm Bureau showing their support, we may finally have a funding mechanism to address our water pollution challenges.</p><ul><li>Clean Energy Progress</li></ul><p>For years, PennFuture has championed legislation that would allow building occupants - including those who are not property owners or who lack roof access - to benefit from solar energy. Community solar legislation (SB472 and HB1555) may finally have its day in the sun.</p><p>Additionally, legislation is progressing to enable changes to a voluntary clean energy financing tool, known as Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE). The update may allow for counties to amend their current programs to expand the financing tool's eligibility to include multi-family buildings (HB1760).</p><ul><li>Environmental Justice</li></ul><p>When Pennsylvania participates in its first emissions-allowance auction as part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), millions of dollars of funding will be made available for clean energy and clean air projects.</p><p>SB 15 and HB 1565 proposes to spend those proceeds on programs that would support workers and communities affected by the clean energy transition, investing specifically in frontline and environmental justice communities.</p><p>Without this legislation, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)is limited by law in how it can spend auction proceeds. That leaves the door open for the General Assembly to siphon or otherwise divert proceeds to causes or programs that would not benefit frontline workers, communities, or our shared environment.</p><p><strong><u>The Bad</u></strong></p><ul><li>RGGI Drama</li></ul><p>Pennsylvania's long journey toward joining RGGI may soon come to pass - but not without more desperate flailing from the state's elected officials. The Legislative Reference Bureau refused to publish DEP's final CO2 Budget Trading Rule until after the House completed a resolution to disapprove the rule. Resolution SCRRR1 passed by a vote of 130-70 in December. Fortunately that's short of being veto proof. After Governor Tom Wolf issues his veto, the path to joining the emission-trading program will finally be clear.</p><ul><li>Ban on Natural Gas Bans</li></ul><p>Across the country, gas utilities are responding with fear to the growing number of restrictions on gas connections. Consistent with efforts to rapidly decarbonize, cities such as New York and San Francisco have placed limits on gas hookups in new construction homes and businesses. But rather than find creative strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Pennsylavanians' natural gas use, HB 1947 and SB 275 would simply prevent individual municipalities from developing their own policies. This ""energy choice"" legislation is not only bad climate policy, it's totally inconsistent with claims that the General Assembly values the independence of local municipalities to develop their own regulations.</p><ul><li>Undermining Spill Reporting Tools</li></ul><p>Pipeline accidents, fuel tanker spills, and other environmental catastrophes remain regular occurrences. Despite the need to better enforce existing clean water protections, HB 1842 allows polluters to pollute more, without notifying anyone or without consequence. The legislation would egregiously take away our rights to know when a spill or discharge is impacting public health and local businesses. It jettisons spill reporting requirements from the experts at the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC) and DEP, leaving our waters unprotected and with our communities, families, and businesses uninformed of the risks.</p><p>PennFuture will continue to monitor the legislative actions coming from the General Assembly - the good as well as the disastrous. Stay engaged for action alerts so you can help make sure our legislators act in the best interests of Pennsylvania's natural environment and our most-vulnerable communities.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Ezra P.

"Goodbye 2021, Hello 2022",12/28/2021,"<p>When I was a kid, my gang of cousins and I did this thing we called Goodbye School, Hello Summer. An uncle supervised the building of a little bonfire, and in it we burned our books, notebooks and worksheets, and then roasted potatoes in the embers. Good memories, even better potatoes.</p><p>It's a comforting recollection of times when taking stock of what was, and what might be, was simpler. As kids growing up in the anthracite region, tossing into a fire the unpleasant, to clear the way for the days of summer, then start all over a few months later and hoping for a better result the next time around, wasn't the worst of our ideas.</p><p>But here we are, all grown, another year wrapping up and a new one only days away. We're trying to reconcile the current year into a new one. What are the take-aways from 2021, what are the threads that will carry us into 2022, and what might we expect from a new year to the extent we can predict anything?</p><p>I can't identify a bigger cause for vigilance and action than the threats to our democracy that have remained a constant through 2020 into 2021. Yes, PennFuture's mission is an environmental one, but our theory of change relies on having a bipartisan, pro-environment legislature. Our current legislature is far from that benchmark.</p><p>Attacks on our democracy haven't let up in the past year, and certainly not in the realm PennFuture so often focuses our gaze upon - the state legislature. The same players working to erode our democracy are attacking environmental laws, climate proposals and regulatory programs - constantly. The entrenchment of its tribes, unholy alliances with industry, and vastly different opinions about what is best for Pennsylvanians is a discordant and constant thrum that has run through year one of the current two-year legislative session.</p><p>The upcoming 2022 elections and how Pennsylvanians intend to conduct our elections will bring the differences and discord into even sharper focus. As the state legislature approaches the soundness of our democracy, so will go our futures, and prospects for addressing the climate crisis. </p><p>So in 2022 we must be prepared for harder threats to our democracy. We need to be prepared for amped-up attempts to stymy voting through discriminatory practices, and more barriers to creating fairer state and federal legislative district maps. </p><p>Through PennFuture's strategic work in the civic engagement and democracy arena, we are ready to do our part.<a href=""/democracyforall"">Democracy for All PennFuture</a> is a program that registers voters, does civics education and increases voter turnout. Democracy for All is aimed at under-represented demographics including communities of color, single women and young voters, groups where there are gaps between eligibility to vote and actual registrations. Working as part of PA Voice, a statewide table that coordinates efforts of organizations doing similar work, we will build upon PennFuture's program in the Lehigh Valley, expand to Allegheny County, and hopefully establish a presence in Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties, two counties that have been chronically underserved with deep legacies of environmental injustices.</p><p>Our strategic partner Conservation Voters of PA will also be engaging voters in the Philadelphia collar counties and the Poconos.Our democracy must hold together as we go to polls to elect a new governor in 2022. Redistricting should grab the attention of voters everywhere. Geographies of representation will shift, and voters have important decisions to make about who will represent them and their communities in Harrisburg and Washington.</p><p>There is cause for guarded optimism for new laws to restore and protect water quality in 2022. There is overdue bipartisan support for several of PennFuture's legislative priorities including the creation of a Clean Water Fund, and <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&sind=0&body=S&type=B&bn=251"">programs to educate and limit fertilizer application</a>. In a very exciting development, the reauthorization of a <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&sind=0&body=S&type=B&bn=525"">Growing Greener-like programis looking good</a>. This will enable investments in many of the sectors and priorities named by PennFuture in our <a href=""/greenstimulus"">Green Stimulus and Economic Recovery Platform for PA</a>. If support for these proposals remains on track, there will be cause for celebration, not only for the environment, but for the bi-partisanship that will have made these wins possible.</p><p>As we enter 2022, there is justifiable concern for the fate of what has been PennFuture's climate priority since October 2019-Pennsylvania's enrollment in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), and the resulting reductions of climate-killing emissions in our power sector. Anti-environmental legislators have fought vigorously to kill what was directed by <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-takes-executive-action-to-combat-climate-change-carbon-emissions/"">Governor Wolf's executive order</a> to move us into RGGI.There is the possibility for the program to be implemented in early 2022, but the fights will move into the courts, where PennFuture will work to defend this important program.</p><p>As an organization, PennFuture is a vital team of watchdogs, defenders, and organizers who care deeply about our state, its communities and environment. This upcoming 2022 is as important a New Year as ever. We are working hard toward our mission and need all of you by our side doing the same. We have been encouraged by the sustainable measures included in President Biden's priorities, and we're are all aware of how wrought and complicated the politics of advancing these pro-climate measures have been and will continue to be. We must all stay engaged on the state, federal and local levels. So as we wrap the year, I hope you all find some precious time for respite and re-charge for the big year ahead.</p><p>Thank you for being part of PennFuture.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jacquelyn Bonomo, PennFuture President and CEO"
PennFuture Meets with State Agencies About Asphalt-Plastic Mixture,12/20/2021,"<p>On Thursday, December 9, 2021, PennFuture met with representatives from the Departments of Transportation (PennDOT), Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), Environmental Protection (DEP), and General Services (DGS), Pennsylvania GreenGov Council, and engineering firm RK&K.</p><p>The purpose of this meeting was to gather more information <a href=""https://www.govtech.com/fs/pa-to-pave-road-with-asphalt-recycled-plastic-mixture"">regarding a pilot program announced in October</a> to pave a portion of a Ridley Creek State Park roadway in Delaware Countywith an asphalt and recycled plastic mixture. We stated our support for innovative ways to reduce single-use plastic trash in our environment, and our willingness to learn more about the pilot project, their plans for testing and evaluation over their stated five-year period, any additional pilot projects they may be considering, while also expressing PennFuture's water quality concerns regarding microplastic pollution.</p><p>Since the initial letter requesting a meeting was sent, it was announced in November that Shell would be paving <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/story/news/2021/11/12/shell-partners-recycling-company-pave-roads/8588093002/"">nearly six miles of their Beaver County site</a> with an asphalt and plastic mixture. We inquired further about this project as well.</p><p>DCNR, DEP, and the other agencies present stressed their desire to seek innovative ways to reduce plastic pollution in our Commonwealth.</p><p>The plastic modified asphalt mixture used in the pilot program is being evaluated by PennDOT's laboratory, where ongoing controlled testing is being conducted. Early laboratory testing exhibits no microplastics released from the asphalt mixtures containing the recycled plastic modifier. Field tests will be conducted two times a year for three years (and then annually for the next two years), specifically to study the effect of natural wear-and-tear on the roadway, and will assess whether microplastics are detected in rainwater runoff from the test and conventional asphalt roadway sections. As part of ongoing research led by PennDOT, they anticipate engaging in more pilot projects utilizing similar asphalt modifiers or other recycled materials products to support the Commonwealth's move to more sustainable policies and infrastructure.<br /><br /> PennDOT also noted that asphalt modifiers are not uncommon, especially when incorporating asphalt millings [commonly known as recycled asphalt pavement (RAP)] in new asphalt mixtures. PennDOT emphasized that DOTs extend the life cycle of asphalt by utilizing modifiers manufactured with polymers from virgin sources. In the case of the plastic modified asphalt mixture used in this pilot program, the agencies note that the plastic component is a 2% additive of the binder that comprises approximately 5% of the overall asphalt mixture - which results in a very minimal amount of plastic present. Yet, this quantity of plastic adds stiffening but does not compromise the required flexibility of the pavement; too stiff, and the asphalt can crack while too much flexibility results in the formation of ruts. According to the representatives present, laboratory and field trials undertaken in other states indicate that plastic concentrations above 5% may risk increased cracking. The agencies claim that the release of microplastics seems highly unlikely because the modifier, which can be in a paste, wax, or pellet form, is melted and homogenized as an inseparable binder mixture during the formulation of the asphalt at the plant; however, they are committed to undertaking the studies discussed above.</p><p>In regards to the Shell asphalt-plastic mixture project, the agencies present stated that there is little oversight in regards to private projects such as this one. Many contractors do follow PennDOT asphalt specification, but PennDOT does not have a say on private roads. DEP, however, can choose to monitor the environmental impact of these private roads. DEP stated that they do not have plans to monitor the Shell road project at this time. In response to PennFuture's concerns about this use of post-consumer plastic modifiers creating more microplastic water pollution, one of the representatives said that <a href=""https://greenmantra.com/the-plastic-road-ahead/"">Green Mantra</a>, the organization behind Shell's mixture, has stated their lab tests showed that nothing was identified as plastic one the asphalt and plastic were mixed.</p><p>Microplastic contamination is a prevailing issue worldwide, including in Pennsylvania. PennEnvironment <a href=""https://pennenvironment.org/reports/pac/microplastics-pennsylvania"">sampled over 50 of Pennsylvania's rivers</a>, lakes, and streams and found microplastics in 100% of those samples -- with the subsequent report stating that humans are consuming roughly a credit card's worth of plastic every week.</p><p>We appreciate the agencies' willingness to meet with us and offer more clarity in regards to the pilot program. While the agencies expressed their comfort with the use of post-consumer plastic in asphalt mixtures not increasing microplastic pollution in our waters, PennFuture still has concerns regarding the long-term environmental impacts of the asphalt-plastic mixture. We will continue to monitor projects like this that could add to the alarming presence of microplastics in Pennsylvanias waters.</p>",Community; Energy; Environment,"John Ukenye, Policy Analyst"
Renewable Natural Gas: Hope or Hype?,12/16/2021,"<p>""Renewable natural gas"" (RNG) sounds good, but does it live up to the hype as a green alternative to fracked gas or is it something like the mythical ""clean coal""- <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ad-firm-behind-clean-coal_b_210086"">an invention of a high-powered advertising agency hired</a> by a coal-industry front group? Like many things, the reality is a little more complicated than labels like ""clean"" or ""green.""</p><p>Fracked gas is a fossil fuel. It's made up primarily of methane (CH4) that was formed hundreds of millions of years ago from the decay of plant and animal waste and has been trapped deep underground ever since. Rather than leaving it undisturbed, we drill and frack to bring it to the surface where it either leakes into the atmosphere or is burned releasing carbon dioxide (CO2). In either case, it's pollution directly contributes to the climate crisis.</p><p>There is another fuel called ""biogas"" which isn't a fossil fuel-it is formed from decaying waste in landfills, sewage plants, or livestock farms. Instead of releasing long buried pollutants, biogas is part of a carbon cycle where plants and animals take up carbon and then release it as waste a relatively short time later. This at least raises the possibility of having fuel use result in no net increase in carbon pollution.</p><p>While replacing fracked gas with biogas seems like an obvious solution, it doesn't always work. Biogas has a much lower methane content and can contain much more CO2 along with many other chemicals. It isn't the drop-in replacement we would like. That is where RNG comes in-it is biogas that has been refined to be a better substitute for fracked gas.</p><p>So, is substituting RNG for fracked gas the solution we are looking for? There is a temptation to compare RNG to fracked gas in isolation and conclude burning a biofuel is better than burning a fossil fuel. Unfortunately, that is answering the wrong question.</p><p>A lower-emitting version of fracked gas may be a useful tool in our toolbox, but that isn't the ultimate goal. Our actual focus needs to be on the transition to a sustainable energy economy that gets us to net-zero carbon as rapidly as possible. This requires looking at the big picture and asking how RNG fits in our broader energy and environmental systems. It also requires looking at the specific sources of RNG and deciding if using it makes sense.</p><p>For example, one possible source for RNG is from manure produced at a concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). These are industrial operations that raise far more livestock than a farm could naturally manage and, in the process, release huge amounts of pollution to our air and water.Having RNG as a marketable product makes CAFOs more profitable-effectively subsidizing more pollution.</p><p>Some may argue that capturing the methane from CAFOs and creating RNG is a better solution than releasing it into the atmosphere, but that is a false choice.Before we get to that point, we should recognize that CAFOs themselves are the result of policy choices that incentivise industrial agriculture operations at the expense of more sustainable farms.In a well designed system using more traditional farming practices, waste products can be fertilizer rather than being diverted for fuel.</p><p>There are similar issues on the demand side as well.Taking a narrow view one could argue that RNG is a better option for heating, cooking, and other fossil fuel uses.Looking at the big picture we can ask if the fuel use is necessary in the first place.Investments in energy efficiency can be a highly cost-effective way to reduce demand and electrification makes it possible to replace fuel use with clean and renewable energy like wind and solar.</p><p>RNG may have a role in a clean energy future, but at best it will be a supporting actor. We don't have the capacity to make anywhere near enough RNG to displace the current demand for fracked gas, and what we can produce is significantly more expensive.That means that we have to think carefully about where it makes sense to use it.</p><p>Also, RNG production is, at its core, a refinery operation.Even if it can be done in a way that is carbon neutral, there are still potential impacts on the environment and especially on neighboring communities. It might have a role in decarbonizing industrial applications that need methane as a feedstock, rely on combustion as part of the process, or for some other reason can't effectively be electrified, but it's not a panacea.</p><p>For all its potential uses, there are some serious risks.The pipe-dream of RNG ""solving the climate crisis"" could easily become a convenient excuse or justification to build and maintain fossil fuel infrastructure.Doing so will lock in reliance on the fracked gas industry and other unsustainable business practices for years to come.</p><p>Going forward we need to look at the big picture and prioritize our investments in the technologies and systems that we truly need.</p>",Climate; Energy; Environment,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
Civilian Conservation Corps Gaining Momentum in Pennsylvania,12/15/2021,"<p>Momentum is growing for a 21st-century version of the <a href=""https://paconservationheritage.org/stories/the-civilian-conservation-corps-ccc-1933-1942/"">New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps.</a></p><p>The CCC's legacy can be found across America. Many of our parks, bridges, roads, reforested landscapes, and forest-fire defenses are the accomplishments of CCC worker camps. Champions of a modern-day ""Civilian Climate Corps"" envision the potential for CCC to again provide much-needed economic relief while also catapulting forward the nation's efforts to control the climate crisis.</p><p>In a January 2021 Executive Order, President Joe Biden recognized the urgency of putting Americans back to work as well as the huge number of workers we'll need to build the green economy. <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/"">Executive Order 14008</a> calls for a new Civilian Climate Corps Initiative that would ""mobilize the next generation of conservation and resilience workers.""</p><p>Since then, President Biden's vision has materialized in the <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376"">Build Back Better Act.</a> The reconciliation package passed by the U.S. House of Representatives provides $10 billion for the federal government to engage 300,000 Americans with good-paying jobs and workforce-development opportunities over the next decade.</p><p>If adopted by the Senate, the proposed program would - like the original CCC - help lift thousands of Pennsylvanians out of poverty, while building natural climate solutions, climate resiliency projects, and clean energy improvements.</p><p>Many of our most-underserved communities are also the most vulnerable to climate disasters and the public health impacts of climate change. In recognition of these overlapping crises, a <a href=""https://neguse.house.gov/imo/media/doc/CCC%20Letter%20-%20Final%20Signed%20(004).pdf"">framework CCC policy</a> endorsed by Congressional leaders proposed half of funds would be directed toward hiring from disadvantaged and frontline communities, with special attention on formerly incarcerated individuals, unemployed youth, and veterans.</p><p>As Congress continues to negotiate the Building Back Better Agenda, private donors are already working to launch complimentary programs.</p><p>The William Penn Foundation (WPF) <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/william-penn-foundation-20211203.html"">recently announced a $1.65 million Delaware River Climate Corps</a> that would fund up to 200 jobs restoring landscapes, installing green stormwater infrastructure, and performing home weatherization throughout the Delaware River watershed. Funds will expand upon existing, or establish new, climate and conservation workforce programs within ten watershed communities across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and New York, positioning them for additional federal funding.</p><p>WPF should be applauded for its visionary and generous leadership. Their philanthropy will cover the costs for training, mentorships, salaries, and administration of programs across 10 communities.</p><p>The Delaware River Climate Corps stands as a model for how a CCC can uplift environmental justice communities. In particular, WPF plans to prioritize opportunities for young adults aging out of foster care and formerly incarcerated adults reentering society.</p><p>After all, the economic hardship endured by formerly incarcerated people - especially people of color - is comparable with struggles Americans faced during the Great Depression. Prior to the pandemic, the unemployment rate for formerly incarcerated people was estimated to be five times higher than for the general public. At 27 percent, <a href=""https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/outofwork.html"">that's substantially higher</a> than when unemployment peaked in 1933.</p><p>At a time of multiple crises, the CCC can begin the process of correcting generational injustices. We are long overdue to step up action to address the climate crisis, to restore and to reclaim the natural beauty of our natural resources, and to establish meaningful career pathways for members of our society who have the fewest opportunities for advancement.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jared Stonesifer, Director of Media Relations"
PennFuture Appeals MS4 Permits Issued by Department of Environmental Protection,12/7/2021,"<p>In late October, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued two individual Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Individual Permits for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC).</p><p>PennFuture, alongside allied environmental organizations, <a href=""/Files/Admin/Comment-Letter---PennDOT-and-PTC-MS4-IPs_FINAL.pdf"">provided the DEP with feedback</a> during the comment period when these permits were in their draft phase this year.While the DEP has addressed some of our concerns, two critical flaws were enshrined into the final permit. First, the permit gives unequal treatment to PennDOT versus other municipalities, creating a significantly larger volume of overall stormwater runoff. Second, in a defiance of simple logic and science, the DEP has allowed PennDOT to combine together three different watersheds into one for planning purposes. On Monday, November 30, PennFuture filed an appeal of this permit to protect the waterways of the Commonwealth and to ensure that municipalities are all given equal treatment.</p><p>First, a little background. In Pennsylvania, stormwater is a leading cause of impairment of our Commonwealth's waterways, and that stormwater from roads is directly linked to degraded physical, chemical, and biological conditions. These permits, and in particular the PennDOT permit, regulate a huge amount of surface area, and thus a correspondingly huge amount of stormwater pollution. Different watersheds, of course, have different needs in order to protect their individual streams, rivers, and groundwater.</p><p>For the first time, the current cycle (2018-2023) of the MS4 General Permit-which applies to a number of local municipal governments across the state-included a Pollution Reduction requirement. This element was geared towards the restoration of polluted waters, and was designed to allow Pennsylvania to begin to fulfill its Clean Water Act goals of upholding and restoring the designated uses of the waters of the Commonwealth. These local governments have been working diligently to comply with these sometimes-challenging requirements. As a result, many have already made significant progress towards their 2023 goals, and PennFuture applauds that work.</p><p>However, the Pollution Reduction element of the MS4 program cannot be successful without robust participation and leadership by PennDOT and PTC as well. In PennFuture's comments earlier this year, we wrote of our concern that the draft permit, which provided for a lower overall Pollution Reduction number for PennDOT than is required for other municipalities, would severely undercut the overall effectiveness of the Pollution Reduction goal. In the end, the final permit does exactly that: the permit requires PennDOT to reduce existing pollutant loads in the Delaware, Ohio, and Lake Erie watersheds by as little as 3.0% for sediment, while municipalities in those watersheds are required under their applicable MS4 permit to reduce existing pollutant loads for sediment by 10%.</p><p>Thus, we arrive at the current appeal. It is in the nature of PennDOT's business to manage roads and other impermeable surfaces. It's easy to see that by the simple fact that PennDOT mainly manages roads that it will have a higher overall volume of stormwater runoff than a local town or city government, who manage many different kinds of surfaces. The DEP's supporting logic is that even at the lower percentages, PennDOT will reduce their pollutants by a similar amount as regulated municipalities. This logic is the kind that almost makes sense, as long as you don't think about it too hard. DEP's permit tries to hide how low the bar is by focusing comparing apples to oranges: it focuses on the overall volume of stormwater reduction by PennDOT as compared to municipalities, instead of comparing the percentage of reduction.</p><p>Pause and think about the implications of that. If, at only 5% reduction, PennDOT is doing a comparable pollutant reduction to municipalities at 10%, then it is clear that the baseline load of PennDOT must be at least twice that of those municipalities. At that kind of stormwater runoff, the DEP should be striving to minimize it as much as possible, not to give PennDOT a free pass. It is easy to see that this is both unfair to those other municipalities who have been working diligently and a tremendous wasted opportunity for real stormwater runoff reductions and improvement of waterways.</p><p>In addition to this flaw in overall volume reductions, the permit allows PennDOT to combine three major watersheds into one for the purposes of developing a pollution reduction plan. The EPA allows watershed-based permits because it recognizes that viewing each watershed holistically-from the big rivers to the small streams to the groundwater-makes more sense from a scientific standpoint and leads to better outcomes. It doesn't take an advanced degree to see that combining different watersheds goes directly against this principle, because it is no longer viewing each watershed holistically.</p><p>Because of these two significant problems, PennFuture has appealed this permit. We won't let the this potentially major runoff issue flow downstream any further.</p>",Community; Environment,"Emma Bast, Staff Attorney"
Living in the Blast Zone: Fracking's Bomb Trains,12/6/2021,"<p>In March of this year, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/fracking-ban-delaware-river-permanent-drbc-20210225.html"">banned the process of hydraulic fracturing</a>, or fracking, within the watershed. While this vote is a victory, it did not end all threats posed by the industry to the basin. To that end, the DRBC <a href=""/Blog-Item-DRBC-Proposed-Regulations-Ban-Discharge-of-Fracking-Wastewater-Discourages-Fracking-Related-Interbasin-Water-Transfers"">has not yet finalized rules</a> on the transport of fracking wastewater through the region, as well as the withdrawal of water from the basin for the purpose of fracking in the Marcellus Shale region.</p><p>While the issue of fracking in the basin is still unsettled, the fracking industry is still thinking of new ways to threaten the health of our waterways and communities. Allow me to introduce you to <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-4-Liquified-Natural-Gas-Should-Not-Become-the-New-Bomb-Trains-to-Threaten-Our-Communities"">bomb trains.</a></p><p>Currently, there are plans to build a natural gas liquefaction facility in Wyalusing, Bradford County that would process fracked gas from the Marcellus Shale and liquefy it for transport via truck or train. This product is called Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), and the intent is for New Fortress Energy to deliver it to a port along the Delaware River <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">more than 200 miles south in Gibbstown, New Jersey</a> for international export.</p><p>Because LNG is so volatile and explosive, transporting it via train <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/03/lng-trains-trump/"">was not permitted in the United States until recently</a>, when the Trump administration changed the rules. LNG must be kept at -260 Fahrenheit in order to stay in liquid form. When the temperature is raised, the methane returns to gas form, expanding up to 600 times its previous volume in liquid form, and the consequences could be catastrophic. According to an article <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/03/lng-trains-trump/"">published in the Washington Post</a>, ""If safety valves fail, what engineers call a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion, or BLEVE, would follow, probably blowing the damaged tank car apart and putting anyone nearby at risk."" Whats more is that LNG is highly flammable, burning at extreme temperatures so hot that a fire fueled by LNG cannot be extinguished; it must simply be allowed to burn out. Some experts liken a large-scale explosion of this material to the <a href=""https://www.njspotlight.com/2021/03/opponents-gibbstown-gloucester-county-lng-terminal-export-want-gov-phil-murphy-follow-delaware-river-basin-fracking-ban-stop-project/"">impact of a nuclear bomb.</a></p><p>While the exact routes for the potential train and truck transport have not been made public, <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/ongoing-issues/lng-gibbstown-interactive-map"">it is not difficult to ascertain what the preferred routes may b</a>e. Both routes will likely travel through densely populated areas, like Allentown, Reading, and Philadelphia. These are routes that already see large amounts of both rail and truck traffic, whose emissions especially impact communities of color and low-income communities. <a href=""https://grist.org/politics/the-delaware-river-basin-paradox-why-fracking-is-so-hard-to-quit/"">According to an article published by Grist</a>, ""More than a million and a half people live within a 2-mile radius of the possible LNG transportation routes. Twenty-nine percent of those individuals, a little less than half a million people, are people of color, and 24 percent, some 400,000 people, are low income. <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/Letter%20from%20Philadelphia%20City%20Officials%20to%20DRBC%20(2020-12-04).pdf"">In a letter to the DRBC last December</a>, Philadelphia city officials wrote that New Fortress Energy's LNG transport route through Philadelphia ""will expose black and brown and low-income communities to the most intense and inescapable zone of impact should there be an accident such as a derailment.""</p><p>To compound the dangers posed to communities of color, this additional traffic - whether by rail or by truck - will exacerbate poor air quality and significantly contribute to the cumulative impacts of pollution that they already face. While rail shipments of LNG could include more than 100 cars per day, there may be as many as 300-400 trucks per day on local routes delivering LNG to the Gibbstown port.</p><p>While the proposed rail routes would not run along the Delaware River, they would, however, run along a lengthy stretch of the Lehigh River, which is a vital tributary to the mighty Delaware and is also the lifeblood of the economies of rural communities in the Poconos. Additionally, the trains would travel through Lehigh Gorge State Park, a beloved site of recreation for folks from the tri-state area. This region is at the heart of the outdoor recreation and tourist industries that are revitalizing communities in the Poconos that were ravaged by the coal extraction industry.</p><p>Ultimately, the transport of LNG along these truck and train routes not only puts historically disadvantaged communities in the blast radius if a catastrophe should occur, but even under the best circumstances, the traffic emissions produced would further degrade the poor air quality that urban centers like Allentown and Philadelphia already experience - <a href=""https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/compare-your-air?msa1=Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton,%20PA-NJ&msa2=Philadelphia-Reading-Camden,%20PA-NJ-DE-MD"">Philadelphia has the worst air quality in the state</a>, while the Lehigh Valley has the distinction of having the fourth worst air quality.</p><p>Fortunately, we have not yet seen bomb trains running through our area, and they may still be prevented from coming to pass.The Biden administration <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/08/2021-23132/hazardous-materials-suspension-of-hmr-amendments-authorizing-transportation-of-liquefied-natural-gas"">has announced its intent to suspend and revisit</a> the Trump-era rule allowing rail transport of LNG.Additionally, the special permit issued to New Fortress Energy allowing it to transport LNG by rail even in the absence of the general Trump-era rule expired on November 30, 2021 (though it is our understanding that, at the last minute, the company applied for an extension). It is unclear whether this means the end of the risk of bomb trains, and we must remain vigilant against this risk.</p><p>There is no question that transporting LNG from the liquefaction plant in Wyalusing to Gibbstown poses clear and present dangers for communities along the proposed routes. This entire scheme of ""dry"" LNG, liquifying the fracked gas hundreds of miles from the export port where it will be shipped to foriegn consumers, is untested, unnecessary, and dangerous. By developing new methods of transport, the fossil fuel extraction industry continues to expand its impacts deep into communities that otherwise are disconnected from the harvesting and processing of material.</p><p>These bomb trains demonstrate the ever-expansive nature of Pennsylvanias environmental sacrifice zones and highlight which communities enjoy the least protection.</p><p>If you'd like to stay informed on LNG in PA and support our efforts, <a href=""/donate"">become a member today!</a></p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Donna Kohut, Policy Manager for Sustainable Economics"
Breaking Down the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,11/23/2021,"<p>The federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) will truly transform Pennsylvania.</p><p>Historic for its size, breadth and ambition, IIJA will mark a historic turning point in the nation's (long overdue) efforts to address climate change, water pollution, and environmental justice, while also rebuilding traditional infrastructure long overlooked, underfunded and under maintained.</p><p>Across the Commonwealth, our infrastructure systems face serious challenges. Pennsylvania has some of the oldest transit systems, underground utilities, and polluted sites in the country. Due to decades without adequate cleanup funds, polluting sites have been left to fester, while Black and brown communities often deal with the resulting health consequences. Our buildings, cars and buses are largely powered by fossil fuels, while at the same time, climate change threatens our communities, natural habitats, and critical infrastructure with greater and more-intense wildfires, heat waves, storms, and flooding.</p><p>With $550 billion in new funding over the next five years, IIJA is a much-needed game changer. If the Build Back Better agenda passes through reconciliation, we could see the federal government spend roughly $500 billion in additional infrastructure funding. Altogether, that's more funding on infrastructure than the nation spent during the New Deal era.</p><p>But will the spending result in more of the same? Or will we see true environmental progress throughout Pennsvylania's communities, better rides while on our commutes, and more-reliable infrastructure during future storms?</p><p>Let's take a look at how each section of the massive infrastructure package grades out for the Commonwealth and for the environment as a whole.</p><p><u>Restoration</u></p><p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: For decades, the federal government has provided inadequate funding for states to clean up legacy pollution whether from mining, oil and gas rigs, or chemical production and disposal. That's about to change. Here are comparisons of how IIJA will increase previous funding levels:</p><ul><li>Abandoned Mine Reclamation: After the country spent $6 billion on cleanup over the past four decades, IIJA will make $11.3 billion available over the next 15 years, with at least a quarter expected to be spent in Pennsylvania.</li><li>Plugging Orphan Wells: The Department of Environmental Protection last year <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/business-fd5ce46869d8405113f159bee0b7c44d"">had less than $800,000 available</a> to plug abandoned oil and gas wells. Moving forward, Pennsylvania is expected to receive a large share of the $4.7 billion allocated nationwide.</li><li>Superfund Sites: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has historically provided states <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-remedial-annual-accomplishments#2020funding"">with about $4.7 billion</a> to remediate toxic Superfund and brownfield sites. Looking ahead, an expansion of how the IRS taxes chemical producers will provide an additional $8 billion for restoration projects.</li></ul><p><strong>What We Don't LIke</strong>: IIJA will provide an unprecedented boost in funding to remediate polluted sites across the country. Still, the costs to fully clean up our degraded land and water far exceed the new funding levels. The costs for abandoned mine lands alone are <a href=""https://appvoices.org/resources/AML_Funding_Projections_11.3billion_simple.pdf"">estimated to surpass $26 billion.</a></p><p><u>Water</u></p><p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: About $1.4 billion will fund repairs to Pennsylvania's deteriorating water infrastructure, improving the safety of drinking water and the quality of the state's waterways. Those funds will help replace the 160,000 lead service lines estimated to still be in operation across the Commonwealth. Regional water protection programs will also receive funding boosts, including programs for the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay.</p><p><strong>What We Don't LIke</strong>: The final legislation provides $15 billion to help remove legacy lead drinking water pipes, far less money than the $45 billion President Joe Biden originally proposed. Any effort to remove lead is progress, but far greater funds will be needed to eliminate the risks of lead poisoning. Build Back Better may add another $9 billion, so stay tuned.<br /><br /><u>Transportation</u></p><p><strong>What we like:</strong> IIJA will encourage more travelers to choose rail or public transit over more polluting modes of travel. Funding will go toward projects that improve rail service along the Northeast Corridor, as well as the Pennsylvanian and Keystone routes, while potentially expanding service into Northeast Pennsylvania. The $2.8 billion allocated to Pennsylvania's bus and rail fleets will be a major boon for public transit across the state, with SEPTA and the Port Authority of Allegheny County receiving much-needed funding. Billions of dollars in new funding will go toward new bicycling and walking trails. Safety for cyclists and pedestrians may improve with new requirements that states develop plans that consider all commuters. A new Reconnecting Communities program will attempt to address historical social justice inequities by uniting communities divided by roadways.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Like</strong>: Much of the federal aid will encourage the status quo. Highway programs will widen roads and add lanes; airport improvements will expand terminal capacity. These projects will inevitably lead to more cars on the road, planes in the air, and emissions to continue.</p><p><u>Electrification</u></p><p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: The most-significant climate change mitigation efforts will come from funding that electrifies transportation and helps the power grid accommodate new sources of demand. The first national investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure will build a network of chargers along U.S. highways and within disadvantaged communities. At least $171 million of new funding will add EV chargers along the Pennsylvania Turnpike and across the state. Transit agencies, school districts, and port authorities will also benefit with funding to purchase and charge zero-emission vehicles. New transmission lines will facilitate expansion of renewable energy into the power grid.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Like</strong>: Grants for charging infrastructure will also be made available for development of propane and compressed natural gas (CNG) refueling stations. Transit agencies will be able to use the funds on ""low-emission buses"" such as hybrid or CNG vehicles, not only ZEVs. Funds for ""clean hydrogen"" fuel cell electric vehicles will potentially subsidize the expansion of natural gas to build new hydrogen supplies.</p><p><u>Clean Energy</u></p><p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will now have authority to approve new transmission capacity in some areas where renewable energy otherwise cannot connect to the grid. Some $6 billion in battery storage will further help to maximize electricity generated from wind and solar power. Pennsylvania's older buildings can better save energy with projects that tap the $3 billion invested nationwide in energy efficiency and weatherization programs.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Like</strong>: Clean energy demonstration projects are great. But we have to question the financial and environmental benefit of continuing to invest in technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration, which many analysts consider simply a lifeline for coal power in a decarbonized world.</p><p><u>Resiliency</u></p><p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: IIJA represents the largest investment in the resilience of physical and natural systems in American history. A total of $50 billion will be spent to protect infrastructure from extreme weather events caused by climate change as well as the increasing threat of cyberattacks. The legislation finally acknowledges that, in addition to mitigating the consequences of climate change, we must prepare for disasters. Otherwise we will keep paying to repair the damage.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Like</strong>: Protecting U.S. coastlines from sea level rise would, on its own, cost more than $400 billion. Addressing the floods, landslides and heatwaves that will accompany the climate crisis will come at a much greater cost. In Pennsylvania, we're already paying <a href=""https://www.phillymag.com/news/2019/11/15/climate-change-costs-pa/"">hundreds of millions of dollars per year.</a></p><p><u>Wildlife</u></p><p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: IIJA clearly includes natural resources in the definition of infrastructure. The package includes$2 billion for Army Corps of Engineers aquatic ecosystem restoration projects, $1 billion for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, $1 billion to repair or remove stormwater culverts that block passage for threatened or endangered fish, $500 million for prescribed burning to limit wildfires, and $350 million for the construction of overpasses that allow wildlife to cross roadways.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Like</strong>: The legislation contains multiple provisions that could potentially limit environmental reviews of infrastructure development under the National Environmental Policy Act. Federal review of certain forest-management and ecosystem-restoration protections may be truncated as a result, suggesting the need for on-going oversight will be essential as so many large infrastructure projects get underway.</p><p>Overall, the infrastructure package will help better connect our communities, repair our broken systems, rejuvenate our polluted landscapes, and better prepare ourselves for the economic and environmental challenges to come. The Build Back Better agenda, if passed by Congress, will take us from fixing what's broken to building the infrastructure that makes us collectively stronger and healthier for generations to come. Look out for more analysis after Congress completes the legislation.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Ezra P. Thrush, Senior Director of Government Affairs"
Philadelphia Energy Solutions Hearing Brings Environmental Justice to Forefront,11/19/2021,"<p>The case for environmental justice stood centerstage this week during a hearing on the ongoing remediation efforts at the former Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) refinery complex. The Pennsylvania Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee <a href=""https://environmental.pasenategop.com/committee-hearing-explores-remediation-of-philadelphia-oil-refinery/"">held its second hearing</a> related to the former refinery and the aftermath of the 2019 <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/energy/bankrupt-pes-philadelphia-refinery-sues-supplier-babcock-for-explosion-20210303.html"">explosion and fire</a> that ultimately led it to cease operations. PennFuture proudly stood with community members, public health experts, and environmental advocates to call for a more vigorous cleanup at the site to guarantee a safer and healthier environment for nearby communities.</p><p>The former refinery site includes an estimated 1,400 acres and encompasses more space than Center City in Philadelphia. For a time, it served as the largest refinery on the East Coast. But more importantly, it served as a constant source of anguish and anger for the surrounding communities as they suffered the ill effects of living in such proximity to <a href=""https://e360.yale.edu/features/in-a-refinerys-ashes-hope-for-an-end-to-decades-of-pollution"">Philadelphia's largest source of pollution</a> and environmental degradation.</p><p>It is important to remember that the refinery <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pes-bankruptcy/philadelphia-energy-solutions-files-for-bankruptcy-after-refinery-fire-idUSKCN1UH0O9"">had struggled financially</a> for many years. PES entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, only to reenter Chapter 11 following the 2019 explosion. Less than a decade earlier, the site's previous owner, Sunoco, deemed the refinery so costly that it was prepared to close its operations if a buyer could not be found. PES purchased the site only with the promise of substantial subsidies and tax relief provided <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/media/20191202091559/refineryreport12219.pdf"">by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</a></p><p>In many ways, the fire that caused the refinery site to close served as <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/energy/south-philadelphia-oil-refinery-explosion-sale-pes-hilco-pollution-environment-20200214.html"">a moment of hope</a> for residents in South and Southwest Philadelphia. Persistent odors emanating from the site began to disappear. Residents began to envision a future use for the site <a href=""https://philly.curbed.com/2019/6/26/18759820/pes-refinery-shutdown-fire-land-remediation"">free of fossil fuels</a> and they hoped for increased collaboration from the new owners, which became Hilco Redevelopment Partners (HRP).</p><p>Although HRP has engaged in a sophisticated and concerted <a href=""https://www.thebellwetherdistrict.com/"">promotional campaign</a> to <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/the-bellwether-district-hilcos-new-brand-for-the-old-pes-refinery-complex-in-south-philly/"">rebrand the site</a>, the new owners have often failed to substantively engage with surrounding communities on the future use of the site, relying on vague plans to create a life sciences hub and distribution center that will supposedly create thousands of jobs. During testimony, PennFuture shared the concerns residents have raised surrounding the narrow interpretation of public participation requirements established by Act 2. Impacted residents have consistently voiced concerns that information related to the remediation is not presented in a timely manner and is not presented in a clear and concise manner. While we recognize that this work began under the cloud of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions on public gatherings, we join community residents in calling for additional efforts from Evergreen Resources Group, LLC (Evergreen), and HRP to substantively engage with the public on the ongoing remediation of the site.</p><p>PennFuture supports the efforts of organizations like the <a href=""https://www.unitedsouthsw.org/"">United South-Southwest Coalition</a> and their ongoing grassroots efforts to engage with residents, harness their collective power, and demand accountability from Evergreen, HRP, the City of Philadelphia, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The refinery may be closed but much work remains to be done to ensure that the site is remediated thoroughly and effectively to ensure the health and safety of nearby communities. PennFuture hopes that the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee will seek to strengthen requirements surrounding public participation under Act 2.</p><p>Most importantly, we hope that this site serves as a stark reminder of the critical need to rethink planning and development in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. No longer can we ignore that low-income communities and communities of color <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/magazine/pollution-philadelphia-black-americans.html"">have suffered a disproportionate impact</a> from historically racist practices like redlining and short-sighted environmental policies that directly harmed their friends and families.</p><p>Environmental justice must be at the heart of our policies related to land use, zoning, and development. Environmental justice must be at the heart of our environmental policies. Last month, PennFuture proudly stood with Governor Wolf, the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus, advocates, stakeholders, and community members, to support executive and legislative initiatives that would codify and expand the Office of Environmental Justice within the Department of Environmental Protection.</p><p>One of those initiatives, <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&body=S&type=B&bn=189"">Senate Bill 189,</a> was introduced by State Senator Vincent Hughes and referred to the Committee in February. PennFuture strongly supports this legislation and its proposed aims of addressing environmental justice in low-income communities and communities of color, integrating environmental justice throughout the regulatory process, and developing a statewide environmental justice strategy for the Commonwealth.</p><p>The remediation efforts at the former refinery complex have further identified the need to review Act 2 and the requirements contained within it. But, this process has also underscored the need to prioritize the health and well-being of people and communities when decisions are being made with regard to land use, zoning, and development. Senate Bill 189 will put Pennsylvania on a path to do this and we hope that the Committee will take up the legislation.</p><p>PennFuture will continue its efforts to craft and support policies across all levels of government to advance the cause of environmental justice and prioritize the health and well-being of disproportionately impacted communities.</p><p>To view the hearing and read all submitted testimony, <a href=""https://environmental.pasenategop.com/environ-111621/"">click here.</a></p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Adam Nagel, Campaign Manager"
Nigerian Princes: How the Fracked Gas Industry Killed Pennsylvania Coal and Raised Electricity Prices While Swimming in Taxpayer Subsidies,11/10/2021,"<p>At one point or another we all likely received one of those emails. A Nigerian prince, or some attorney, bank officer, or minor government official in a far-off country has millions of dollars, gold, ordiamonds stuck in a bankand they need your help to get it out. In returnthey promise, for just a little help, a large chunk of the money will be ours to keep.</p><p>If one responds, the scammer may first ask for something that a legitimate transaction would require, like signatures on official looking papers or copies of identification documents, but that won't be enough. An issue will come up and they will need money to pay for wire transfers, court fees, or even bribes. The amounts may be small compared to the millions they promise, at least at first, but more issues will arise requiring even more money. Eventually the victims either get wise to the scam or run out of money and the fraudsters disappear without a trace. These are known as <a href=""https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/advance-fee-schemes"">advance fee scams</a> and have been perpetrated, in one form or another, for many years.</p><p>One of the reasons these scams work is that, in addition to preying on greed, scammers also rely on some quirks of human psychology-in particular the sunk cost fallacy. This same effect causes people who lose $1,000 at a casino to bet another $1,000 in a desperate attempt to win their money back. Economists say ""rational"" people should cut their losses and move on, but casino owners count on that being much harder than it sounds.</p><p>Governments are susceptible to this too. Perhaps the most famous case was the British and French governments continuing to spend money developing the supersonic aircraft Concorde long after they knew <a href=""http://filestore.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pdfs/large/cab-129-160.pdf"">""there was no economic case for proceeding with the aircraft.""</a> Part of their rationale for going forward anyway was not wanting to lose the ""26,000 jobs"" that would be needed to build the 160 to 250 aircraft they were planning to sell. While the most pessimistic view at the time said they might only sell around 60 aircraft, they didn't even get close to that number. In reality only 14 Concordes were built for commercial service and the 26,000 jobs never materialized.</p><p><u>Sunk Costs in the Fracked Gas and Petrochemical Industry</u></p><p>When the shale gas industry came to Pennsylvania, industry lobbyists toldour legislators how profitable it would be. Not only did they promise 200,000 jobs, they repeatedly referred to a severance tax they fully expected to pay and all the economic benefits the industry would bring to our communities. The only thing they needed was a little help: faster permitting, weak regulations, <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/06/25/pa-grand-jury-report-on-fracking-dep-failed-to-protect-peoples-health/"">poor oversight</a>, low-cost bonding, advantageous zoning rules, the doctor gag rule, eminent domain benefits, and the list goes on. <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1068716167567227972&q=robinson+township+v+commonwealth&hl=en&as_sdt=4,39"">The courts disallowed</a> some of the early gifts to the industry, but many remain and Pennsylvania still doesn't levy a severance tax (instead it charges a more industry beneficial, declining impact fee).</p><p>Investors were taken with the promise of riches and, as the money flowed in, the drilling increased, peaking at almost 2,000 wells drilled in 2011 alone. Even as the drilling continued to grow, it was clear supply was outpacing demand. The gas was selling for $9.00 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in 2008 but was under $6.00/Mcf by 2011 and slid down below $3.50/Mcf in 2020.</p><p>As the glut hit and gas prices dropped, the fracking industry faced a wave of bankruptcies and contractions, some companies got out of the business altogether-the promised jobs and prosperity didn't materialize. Between 2008 and 2019-in spite of the industry increasing production and bringing in tens of millions of dollars-personal income and jobs in the region <a href=""https://www.concernedohioriverresidents.org/post/orvi-report-shows-fracking-boom-was-an-economic-bust"">didn't even keep pace with the growth nationwide.</a> By 2018, there were only <a href=""https://paworkstats.geosolinc.com/vosnet/lmi/profiles/profileDetails.aspx?enc=mLzjSNmrac3CLiUnnSSBItqi1/KvyGUX6e+AB3S/g25RLuVsPiIQsg0eb9PyTPXKjuZcqMitTSCwjmXyYDJSYw=="">4,500 jobs reported in the industry.</a></p><p>While gas jobs didn't grow nearly as much as promised, the industry was spectacularly effective at killing coal jobs. Since 2007, competition from the gas industry caused eleven coal-fired power plants to shut down and five more have announced they will close or convert to gas leaving only one large conventional coal plant in Pennsylvania yet to announce its end.</p><p>Of course, the fracked gas industry had a solution for these job losses. In addition to the existing handouts on the supply side (i.e. lax regulations, no severance tax, etc.), they just needed a little more help-this time on the demand-side. If we just help create new markets for their gas, they claim, surely this time things will work out. Faster permitting and fewer regulations were still high priorities, but the industry also secured <a href=""/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">well over a billion dollars in demand-side subsidies</a> for a new cracker plant to turn fracked gas into plastics and the recently announced gasoline refinery.</p><p>Having the state offer tax credits to companies that locate here is nothing new, but the petrochemical companies didn't want to compete with other industries for the handouts. Enter the Pennsylvania Resource Manufacturing tax credit and the similar Local Resource Manufacturing tax credit-special deals only available to companies that buy gas from the fracking industry. But even that isn't enough. Our legislature <a href=""https://www.timesleader.com/news/1516389/yudichaks-senate-committee-examines-pa-s-natural-gas-infrastructure"">recently held hearings</a> to rail about how failing to invest even more in fracked gas infrastructure, pipelines, and manufacturing technologies ""will devastate Pennsylvania's economy,"" raise electricity prices, and various other claims.</p><p><u>Remember Supply and Demand?</u></p><p>The petrochemical industry and their friends in Harrisburg seem happy to have the citizens of Pennsylvania subsidize both the supply and demand side of gas operations, but what exactly are we trying to accomplish?</p><p>The glut of gas flooding the market during the fracking boom resulted in supply exceeding demand. That drove prices down and, as electricity generation shifted to this cheaper gas, electricity prices stayed flat too. Adjusted for inflation, average electricity prices in Pennsylvania last year were about the same as they were in 2005. In the process, we've gone from less than 5% of our generation coming from gas before the fracking boom to more than 52% in 2020.</p><p>Now, with demand beginning to catch up with supply, prices are once again trending upwards. Henry Hub prices in October2021 were $5.51 per million BTU-a price we havent seen since 2014. Not surprisingly, with our over-reliance on gas for generation, electricity prices are very sensitive to gas prices too and we are seeing sharp increases as well.</p><p>Fracked gas cheerleaders in the state legislature <a href=""https://www.pasenategop.com/blog/yudichak-senate-panels-examine-pas-natural-gas-infrastructure/"">wantto blame increasing consumer prices</a> on environmental advocates who oppose massive subsidies for projects like Royal Dutch Shell's cracker plant in Beaver County, or the recently announced Nacero gasoline refinery in Luzerne County. Others openly advocate for increased gas shipments to Europe and other places. The fracked gas industry might be happy with those ideas, but how exactly is subsidizing projects that increase demand a win for consumers?</p><p>Anyone who took Economics 101 should recognize increasing demand will raise prices, not lower them. If we really want lower consumer prices, we should focus on improving energy efficiency and building new clean resources like wind and solar. That will not only control prices by lowering the demand for fracked gas, it will also protect our economy from over-dependence on fossil fuels and help address the growing climate crisis.</p><p><u>Looking back to where we started.</u></p><p>In much of the current gas-industry talking points, we've lost track of where we started. At the beginning of the shale boom we were told about the riches that were right at our fingertips if we just gave the industry a little help. The industry took their profits, but didn't deliver the promised thousands of jobs and booming economy. Now we are told if we don't give them more, we'll never see those jobs and all the money we've already poured in will be wasted.</p><p>If it was a self-described ""Nigerian Prince"" making those claims, we'd (hopefully) be wary of the advance fee scam and the sunk-cost fallacy and cut our losses.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
"PennFuture, Partners Appeal Air Installation Permit for Proposed Gas-Burning Plant in Elizabeth Township",11/9/2021,"<p>The Allegheny County Health Department (""ACHD"") recently issued an air installation permit for a proposed Invenergy Allegheny Energy Center gas-fired power plant in Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County in Southwestern Pennsylvania. PennFuture, along with our partners the Environmental Integrity Project, Clean Air Council, and Mountain Watershed Association, appealed this permit to the ACHD Hearing Officer. </p><p>This facility would be a large, 639-wegawatt gas-fired power plant that would emit hundreds of tons of noxious pollutants and millions of tons of climate pollutants annually. If completed, this facility would be a major source of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and VOC emissions, and a minor source for particulate matter, PM10, PM2.5, sulfur dioxide, and hazardous air pollutants. A gas-fired power plant like this one would not only contribute to climate change and endanger public health and the environment through its direct emissions, but it would also perpetuate fracking in Pennsylvania and the further entrenchment of the fossil fuel industry in our region. </p><p>The planned location for this facility is on the Youghiogheny River, near the edge of Allegheny County's border with Westmoreland County. Emissions from the facility will impact residents in both counties, surrounding environmental justice communities, and residents of the nearby Mon Valley, who are already overburdened by pollution from industrial sources. Air pollution from this proposed plant will only exacerbate the region's existing struggles with poor air quality from heavily polluting industries and further threaten public health.</p><p>We object to the installation permit on several grounds. The permit issued by ACHD would allow for unlawfully high levels of air pollution and excessive startup, shutdown, and malfunction events. Further, the ACHD failed to properly conduct required analyses, in addition to other significant deficiencies with the permit, <a href=""https://cleanair.org/wp-content/uploads/2021.11.04-CAC-PennFuture-MWA-Notice-of-Appeal-Papers-with-Permit-0959-I001-for-Invenergy-AEC-final.pdf"">as detailed in our Notice of Appeal</a>.

It is clear that these Senators see the writing on the wall: <a href=""https://cleanair.org/rggi-poll/"">60% of voters approve</a> of Pennsylvanias efforts to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2021/06/22/poll-shows-pennsylvanians-support-climate-action-amid-pandemic/"">by a 51-31 margin</a>, Pennsylvanians believe the state should ""pursue policies that prioritize the availability of renewable energy such as solar and wind"" over fossil fuels.</p><p>Instead of doing the right thing on behalf of their hard-working constituents, these Senators are aiming to pit urban and suburban workers against rural workers, all while doing the bidding of the big dirty energy industry who line their campaign coffers.</p><p><u>Debunking the New ""Rising Energy Bills"" Myth</u></p><p>A recently repeated talking point by these Senators revolves around rising energy prices, especially as we head towards the winter season and blaming the rise to ""environmentalists driving out fossil fuels."" As with most of their points raised, this particular point is easily refuted with a simple Google search. <a href=""https://www.iea.org/commentaries/what-is-behind-soaring-energy-prices-and-what-happens-next"">According to the International Energy Agency (IEA)</a>, COVID-19 brought with it a historic plunge in global energy consumption which drove the prices of many fuels to their lowest levels in decades. As the pandemic's impact has declined, fuel prices have rebounded strongly, mainly as a result of an exceptionally rapid global economic recovery (this year is on track for the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/06/08/world-bank-global-economic-prospects-2021"">fastest post-recession growth in 80 years</a>), longer winter seasons in the Northern Hemisphere <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58425526"">due to increased climate change</a>, and a low supply due to the lockdowns earlier in the pandemic that have slowed down maintenance and necessary operational work.</p><p>As I have stated in previous posts, building new renewable energy <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2018/12/03/plunging-prices-mean-building-new-renewable-energy-is-cheaper-than-running-existing-coal/"">is cheaper than running existing coal plants</a> and prices get cheaper every year.

As we are already seeing, the costs of both economically unsustainable sources of energy are being shouldered onto the consumer.</p><p><u>Debunking the ""RGGI Will Kill Jobs"" Myth</u></p><p>Senator Yaw got one thing right in this press conference: ""The environment and the economy are not mutually exclusive."" Among RGGI's 11 current member states, RGGI <a href=""https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">has also created 45,000 jobs</a> across the region since the program's launch and <a href=""https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">added around $4 billion in economic value</a> to the region. Meanwhile, RGGI state economies <a href=""https://acadiacenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Acadia-Center_RGGI_10-Years-in-Review_2019-09-17.pdf"">have grown 31 percent faster</a> than non-RGGI states, even as the RGGI states have cut power plant carbon pollution nearly twice as fast as the rest of the nation.</p><p>I have written <a href=""/Blog-Item-What-You-Wont-Hear-During-the-Aug-17-Public-Hearing-on-Pipelines-in-Pennsylvania"">not once</a>, <a href=""/Blog-Item-Its-Past-Time-for-Pennsylvania-to-Invest-in-Renewable-Energy"">but twice</a> since August of this year about the rise of alternative energy jobs in the U.S., including the ever-increasing competitiveness in terms of pay for workers in various green energy sectors. The renewable energy industry has become a major U.S. employer.

Just as ""the environment and the economy are not mutually exclusive,"" unionized labor, the environment, and economic prosperity can co-exist in harmony.</p><p><u>Debunking the ""We Need Fossil Fuels to Create Everyday Products"" Myth</u></p><p>Senator Yaw often repeats the fallacy that fossil fuels are a necessary part of the creation of televisions, windmills, solar panels, our food production, and other everyday items like make-up. However, sustainable ways to manufacture everyday items <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/smm-electronics/basic-information-about-electronics-stewardship"">have been outlined for years</a>. The major issue facing further sustainable practices in electronics manufacturing has come from <a href=""https://www.vttresearch.com/en/news-and-ideas/five-ways-towards-sustainable-electronics"">a lack of investment</a> in research, development, and implementation of new biodegradable materials and energy-efficient and material-efficient manufacturing techniques This is something <a href=""https://www.sierraclub.org/trade/what-green-new-deal"">a Green New Deal </a>(which these Senators and others relentlessly attack as ""socialist"") would solve.</p><p><u>Leaving their Own Behind</u></p><p>Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) has not only detailed the benefits of renewable energy on the nation's economy, but they <a href=""https://rmi.org/renewables-offer-rural-america-the-economic-development-opportunity-of-a-generation/"">have repeatedly highlighted</a> how Appalachia, and Pennsylvania specifically, can stand the most to gain from a Clean Energy Economy. By 2030, US wind and solar is on track to generate more than $60 billion in annual revenue-on par with the three leading US agricultural commodities: corn ($58 billion), soy ($44 billion), and beef production ($70 billion). Analysis conducted for RMI's Seeds of Opportunity report indicates that the projected 600 GW of new wind and solar projects built between 2020 and 2030 <a href=""https://rmi.org/insight/seeds-of-opportunity/"">would generate $220 billion in direct, lifetime economic benefits</a>. This is a gamechanger for Rural America, of which much of Pennsylvania falls into.</p><p>These Senators spent the entire press conference adopting populist language while offering citizen-harming solutions and empty, fake promises. If these Senators really care about the worker, they would be actively working to secure their whole personhood -- promoting the proliferation of high-earning long term jobs, protecting their air, their water, and their land. It is past time they stop making excuses on behalf of a dirty energy past, and stand up for a clean, green Pennsylvania energy future.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"John Ukenye, Policy Analyst"
The Basics of Hydrogen,11/4/2021,"<p>Back in the 1970s and 1980s, the comedian Don Novello performed in character as Father Guido Sarducci.One of his famous bits was the Five Minute University where, in just five minutes, he would teach you everything the average college student remembers five years after graduation.For his Spanish class you would only learn the phrases ""¿Como está usted?"" and ""Muy bien"" figuring that you'd probably forget the rest anyway. For economics, you would just learn ""supply and demand."" <a href=""http://standupeconomist.com/"">Physics isn't as funny as economics</a>, but if that were included you'd probably just need to remember ""conservation of energy.""</p><p>If that is the only thing anyone remembers from their science classes, it would be enough to understand why many of us are skeptical about hydrogen ""solving"" the climate crisis.</p><p><u>The challenge with hydrogen</u></p><p>Most of the hydrogen we use industrially today is made from methane (CH4)-the major component in fracked gas.Often called ""gray hydrogen"" this, not surprisingly, has significant environmental problems.Aside from all the energy used and pollution released in drilling and fracking for the methane, extracting the hydrogen creates carbon pollution as a waste product.Although people claim that carbon capture could reduce these emissions, that presents huge technical problems.Also, it should be clear that carbon capture is only going to make the resulting gas more expensive.</p><p>There is a cleaner alternative, known as ""green hydrogen,"" that is mostly produced by electrolysis-running electricity through water to split the H20 molecule into hydrogen and oxygen.Unlike gray hydrogen, if the electricity is obtained from a clean renewable source there are no dangerous emissions.The chemical formula for the process looks like this:</p><p><em>2H20 + energy → 2H2 + O2</em></p><p>To get useful energy out of the resulting hydrogen fuel, we generally need to burn it.What we call ""burning"" is just something reacting quickly with oxygen and releasing a lot of heat. In the case of Hydrogen, that is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudCaJB_Xx4"">a very energetic reaction</a> and the chemical formula should look very familiar.It's the opposite of electrolysis:</p><p><em>2H2 + O2 → 2H20 + energy</em></p><p>Conservation of energy tells us that the energy that comes out of that chemical reaction must come from somewhere.It did-it's the energy we had to add to split water into hydrogen and oxygen in the first place.It shouldn't be a surprise that we cant get more energy out of the reaction than we put in.As the Nobel prize winning <a href=""https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7246691M/Treatise_on_thermodynamics."">physicist Max Planck once wrote</a>, ""It is in no way possible, either by mechanical, thermal, chemical, or other devices, to obtain perpetual motion, i.e. it is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a cycle and produce continuous work, or kinetic energy, from nothing.""</p><p><u>We need action, not delay</u></p><p>This doesn't mean green hydrogen is useless-we just need to think of it more like a battery than a fuel, and this has some implications for our policy planning. We also need to be skeptical about some of the messaging we hear about hydrogen-particularly the claim that we are just using fracked gas or dirty hydrogen now, but sometime in the future when technology improves we will move to cleaner green hydrogen. </p><p>It should be obvious that if we can use clean energy directly, it doesnt make sense to turn it into green hydrogen first, and that isn't going to make sense in the future either.Planning to use fracked gas or dirty hydrogen on projects that we can electrify-even if we claim we are only doing it ""for now""-just makes things worse.</p><p>It should also be obvious that doing essentially nothing while hoping a miracle technology will be developed that will fix the problem for us is irresponsible, unethical, and bad policy.Unfortunately, this is exactly the approach the fossil fuel industry is pushing to protect their profits for a few more years.It would be great if some new technology comes along to make decarbonization easier and cheaper, but after decades of inaction, we've already wasted more time waiting and hoping than we had to spare.We have the tools and the technology to make significant progress in the fight against climate change right now-we just need the will to act.</p><p><u>Potential uses for hydrogen by sector</u></p><p>If we are going to reduce carbon pollution, we need to pay attention to where those emissions are coming from in the first place.Then, we can think about the role a green hydrogen ""battery"" might play in reducing those emissions.The chart below shows emissions reported by the DEP in their <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=3925177&DocName=2021%20PENNSYLVANIA%20CLIMATE%20ACTION%20PLAN.PDF%20%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:green%3b%22%3e%3c/span%3e%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:blue%3b%22%3e%28NEW%29%3c/span%3e%209/21/2023"">2021 Climate Action Plan</a> broken down into sectors.</p><p>It shouldn't surprise anyone that hydrogen projects have been proposed in all of these areas, but if we are going to prioritize resources and effort, we need to consider more than whether a particular use is technically possible.Ideally we want strategies that are economical compared to other zero-carbon alternatives and can scale sufficiently to make a significant difference.</p><p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-1eac4fc5-7fff-3417-5b0a-ae153c9d93ef""><a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=3925177&DocName=2021%20PENNSYLVANIA%20CLIMATE%20ACTION%20PLAN.PDF%20%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:green%3b%22%3e%3c/span%3e%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:blue%3b%22%3e%28NEW%29%3c/span%3e%209/21/2023""><span><span><img height=""357"" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eIjhyuB9Sl9auxBXG_fKYhxVE4n9zKmIxXKCi-_yamtEQWX7MCSrJN959CsX2GuVllFWnLcSAerg-K_A8on8XR1HO_NCRbfIk0lNK8Ku4TE_v3nsVvFHNhNaqewHcAPlxDeGwiXs"" width=""624"" /></span></span></a></span></p><p>The maxim that, if we can use clean energy directly, it doesnt make sense to turn it into hydrogen rules out a lot of uses in the electric generation sector.Hydrogen generation may come in handy getting electricity to locations where we can't run powerlines, and it may become an effective way to store surplus clean generation for when we need it, but it's not going to lessen the need for significantly more clean generation on our grid.</p><p>The residential sector isn't likely to be a key hydrogen market either.While it's technically possible to use hydrogen instead of gas for heating, cooking, and other applications, it's simpler and cheaper to electrify. Because hydrogen is a very tiny and light molecule it leaks at any opportunity, it's also incompatible with a lot of existing infrastructure. Large scale use of hydrogen would require we either retrofit or build out entirely new distribution networks both under our city streets and in many thousands of existing homes. That would be prohibitively expensive.</p><p>Transportation has more potential, although probably not for most light duty cars and trucks.Transportation always presents a chicken-and-egg problem where no one wants to buy a car without convenient refueling/recharging infrastructure and no one wants to invest in the infrastructure unless there are the cars around to use it.This is one of the reasons why natural gas vehicles, despite years of design and production, are rarely seen outside of centrally-fueled fleets. </p><p>Hydrogen vehicles, particularly fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), have some distinct advantages over battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in terms of weight, range, and recharging times, so it's possible they could gain a foothold in the market.BEVs on the other hand are generally cheaper to operate, they can take advantage of a lot of existing infrastructure, and for many of us they are good enough in terms of range and other factors.Given their cost effectiveness and head start in the market, it seems likely BEVs will continue to oupace FCEVs, at least in the near term.</p><p>Outside of light duty vehicles, the case for hydrogen is stronger.Commercial applications that have centrally-fueled fleets and need rapid turn-around after refueling, such as transit vehicles and some trucking are promising areas for hydrogen.Also, while battery operated aircraft exist they are very limited in endurance and hydrogen might prove useful there too if the weight of storage tanks can be kept low enough.Similar applications may exist in the shipping and rail industries as well.To be sure, cutting all of these emissions are important, but cars and light trucks are the largest contributors to transportation emissions.</p><p>The commercial and industrial sectors also have significant potential.Most sources cite industries like cement making, steel manufacturing, and ammonia production as areas where hydrogen should be considered.There are likely many other applications as well but, while we shouldn't discount where hydrogen can be used to decarbonize commercial applications, we don't want to over-sell hydrogen as a solution either.</p><p>Like in transportation, generation, and other sectors hydrogen is most likely to be used in specific industrial applications that can't be plugged into the grid or, for some other reason, can't be readily electrified.While there could be thousands of different processes in the industrial sector that fit this bill, any one technology might only apply to a small handful of facilities. The big players like steel, cement, and ammonia may be on everyone's radar, but to really decarbonize the industry we are going need to dig a lot deeper.</p><p><u>How we move forward</u></p><p>Step number one is to stop making the problem worse.This means not subsidizing fossil fuels and new petrochemical projects-even if the backers promise that someday the fracked gas will be replaced by hydrogen.Every ton of carbon pollution we add is a ton we're going to need to remove later, and every piece of infrastructure we build is a potential stranded asset that tends to lock us into future fossil fuel use.</p><p>Step number two is to invest more in the technologies that are available today.This means building more wind and solar, adopting cost-effective energy efficiency measures, improving our grid and distribution network to support electrification, and replacing gas and diesel vehicles with EVs.<br /><br /> Step number three is where we invest some limited resources in basic research and development of new technology.This is not because we are counting on a panacea that will solve the crisis-although that would be welcome.Research will be needed to find solutions for the hundreds of small issues we are sure to encounter along the way.</p><p>Like many things, controlling emissions often follows something like an 80/20 rule where that last 20% on the way to net zero emissions is likely going to be the most difficult.New approaches such as producing hydrogen from algae, waste, or other methods may find a niche in these cases.Similarly, new ways to store and transport hydrogen such as using liquid organic hydrogen carriers or other methods may find a role in our energy economy.It's prudent to keep the research and development in these areas going, but the important part now is not to get so hung up on the ""20% problems"" that we stop trying to deal with the 80% of emissions we can control today.</p><p>The topic of hydrogen can seem heavy and hard to digest. To help explain the issue more clearly, PennFuture partnered with the Ohio River Valley Institute on Nov. 28 to present an educational webinar to Pennsylvania advocates and leaders.

Connecting Pennsylvania with COP26,11/3/2021,"<p>The eyes of the world are turned to my adopted home away from home, Glasgow, now the beating heart of the planet for the next two weeks because of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26.The imperative for bold action on climate has never been greater.</p><p>Pennsylvania needs a good outcome from COP26, for a lot of exquisitely good reasons, but we live in a state very much dominated by fossil fuels, for centuries, so it's getting more and more complicated to extract climate leadership from one body you'd typically expect leadership from - our state elected officials. </p><p>Despite the science and the climate emergency and its links to the burning of coal, gas and oil, Pennsylvania's fossil fuels interests have shown no sign of letting up - keeping up a steady drumbeat of climate denialism, and maintaining a good flow of contributions to politicians. They have lots of help from friendly state elected officials, mostly anti-environmental Republicans with very loud voices and influence in Harrisburg.Together these chums have revived the stereotypeof branding as extreme those environmentalists promoting the expansion of renewable energy.They've framed our ideas as a radical agenda that will destroy the state's energy industry.They've successfully championed billions in tax credits and subsidies that deepen the state's reliance on the sector at taxpayer expense.</p><p>The fossil fuel industry, and their friends in labor and government have doubled down on fracking, petrochemicals and plastics.They view Pennsylvania's energy industry through the singular lens of fossil fuels, ignoring the myriad other sources, including a growing renewables portfolio, that make up our energy industry. And they never talk about the fact that the greener energy sector employs more people here than does the dirty energy sector.</p><p>Here's the current state of affairs in that sector according to this most recent (Oct. 21, 2021) Energy Profile offered by the US Energy Information Administration (the emphases are mine):</p><ul><li><em>Pennsylvanias marketed natural gas production, primarily from the Marcellus Shale, reached a <strong>record</strong> 7.1 trillion cubic feet in 2020, and the <strong>state is the nations second-largest natural gas producer</strong> after Texas.</em></li><li><em>Pennsylvania is the <strong>third-largest coal-producing</strong> state in the nation after Wyoming and West Virginia, and it is the <strong>second-largest coal exporter</strong> to foreign markets after West Virginia.</em></li><li><em>In 2020, Pennsylvania ranked second in the nation after Illinois in electricity generation from nuclear power. However, natural gas generation surpassed nuclear generation in 2019 to provide the largest share of in-state electricity generation.</em></li><li><em>Over half of Pennsylvania households use natural gas as their primary home heating fuel, and the states <strong>49 underground gas storage sites--the most for any state</strong>--help meet regional heating demand in winter.</em></li><li><em>Pennsylvania is the third-largest net supplier of total energy to other states, after Wyoming and Texas.</em></li></ul><p>Those are some impressive rankings for our state, and I can understand the appeal of ongoing economic exploitation of Pennsylvanias fossil fuels.But the toll has become too great on our communities that boom and bust, blossom and shrivel depending on market manipulations.And, these fuels harm our bodies, our air, our children and our water, and desecrate our land.</p><p>But, all is not lost. Pennsylvania voices are breaking through in climate leadership, and some voices have been around for a long time.These individuals have embraced life-long personal missions toward climate action:Former PennFuture CEO Larry Schweiger of western Pennsylvania, former PennFuture board chair Char Magaro of Enola, and former board member Dr. Jim Jones of Mechanicsburg.No other scientist has been able to slice through industry lies that muddle the utter seriousness of the emergency than Dr. Michael Mann, climatologist, geophysicist, and director of PennState's Earth System Science Center, and PennFuture Board member.PennFuture board member Steve McCarter founded the House Climate Caucus while a member of the State House Legislature.U.S. Congressman Brendan Boyle will travel to Glasgow as part of Speaker Nancy Peolsi's delegation.And Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto has distinguished himself as an American climate leader standing up to Donald Trump and fossil fuel interests that targeted his city.</p><p>We are happy to report that several of these individuals will be joining us at noon on Tuesday, November 16 for a webinar to offer their reflections on COP26. This will be a chance for PennFuture's members to hear directly from those on the frontlines of climate action in Glasgow, and a chance for participants like Congressman Boyle and Mayor Peduto and others to offer their hopes and opinions on what comes next after COP26.</p><p>The stakes couldn't be higher at COP26. Here's to hoping leaders like Boyle and Peduto have a front-row seat at COP26 to real, meaningful, and ambitious climate action, and that our world finally starts to take seriously the enormous task of combating the climate crisis.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jacquelyn Bonomo, PennFuture President and CEO"
"DRBC Proposed Regulations Ban Discharge of Fracking Wastewater, Discourages Fracking-Related Interbasin Water Transfers",11/2/2021,"<p>Earlier this year, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) released final regulations <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fracking-Banned-in-Delaware-River-Basin"">that banned fracking in the watershed</a>, citing decades of scientific and technical studies, reports, and findings. This is a monumental step in the protection of our waters and health throughout the Delaware basin. Although litigation on DRBC's fracking ban <a href=""/Blog-Item-Federal-Court-Dismissed-Lawsuit-Challenging-DRBCs-Ban-on-Fracking"">is ongoing</a>, PennFuture remains confident that these strong and necessary protections will withstand any legal challenge.</p><p>At the time the fracking ban was announced, the DRBC also rescinded its previous draft regulations regarding fracking wastewater and interbasin water transfers. In our <a href=""/Blog-Item-Public-Comment-Closes-on-DRBC-Fracking-Regulations"">2018 comments</a> on the original draft regulations, PennFuture said that if these regulations couldn't be strengthened to ensure that the water resources of the basin would be protected, then DRBC has a duty to ban these activities within the watershed.</p><p>Well, it appears that the DRBC was listening as these new proposed regulations prohibit the discharge of fracking wastewater, including co-products and byproducts, within the Delaware River watershed, whether on land or directly into the water. This ban includes the use of fracked wastewater ""brine"" spreading on dirt and gravel roads.</p><p>This is critical for the health of the waters, wildlife, ecosystems, and humans since fracked wastewater contains thousands of chemicals, many of which we don't even know about and some that can be <a href=""/Blog-Item-New-Report-Details-the-Use-of-Forever-Chemicals-in-Fracking-Operations-Despite-Serious-Concerns-to-Public-Health"">harmful</a>, toxic, or even <a href=""/Blog-Item-Toxic-Fracking-Waste-Becomes-Mounting-Problem-for-Downstream-Communities"">radioactive</a>. This is also especially important for the upper Delaware basin where approximately <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.wordpress.com/"">80% of the commonwealth's Exceptional Value waters</a> and wetlands are located. A recent <a href=""http://www.paenvironmentdigest.com/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=53454&SubjectID=58"">study by Penn State University</a> found that road spreading of oil and gas drilling wastewater is significantly less effective than commercial alternatives and increases the potential harm to aquatic systems, human health, and agriculture.</p><p>In addition, the new draft regulations continue the DRBC's position to ""discourage"" importation and exportation of waters to and from the basin (e.g., interbasin water transfers), and set out specific criteria that must be met in each case to be allowed by the DRBC.</p><p>PennFuture is still reviewing these draft regulations, but at first glance it appears that the DRBC is taking seriously its authority - and duty - to protect the Delaware watershed from the inherent harms of fracking. We will be submitting written comments and participating in the proposed public hearings on these proposed regulations, and we encourage all of you to do the same.</p><p>The DRBC is seeking comments on the effects the proposed rules may have within the Delaware River Basin on the following:</p><ul><li>water availability;</li><li>the control and abatement of water pollution;</li><li>economic development;</li><li>the conservation and protection of drinking water supplies;</li><li>the conservation and protection of aquatic life;</li><li>the conservation and protection of water quality in Special Protection Waters; and</li><li>the protection, maintenance and improvement of water quantity and quality basinwide.</li></ul><p>The DRBC will also consider any other comments that concern the potential effects of the draft rules on the conservation, utilization, development, management and control of the water and related resources of the basin.</p><p>Written comments are due to the DRBC by 5:00pm on Friday, January 28, 2022, and must be submitted via the DRBC's online public comment collection system. More information and details on submission may be found <a href=""https://www.nj.gov/drbc/meetings/proposed/notice_import-export-rules.html"">at the DRBC's website.</a></p><p>Virtual public hearings will be held on the following Wednesdays in December:</p><ul><li>December 8, 2021, 2:30-4:30pm</li><li>December 8, 2021, 6:30-8:30pm</li><li>December 15, 2021, 1:00-3:00pm</li><li>December 15, 2021, 4:00-6:00pm</li></ul><p>Please visit the DRBC's website for more information and to register to speak.</p><p>We couldn't do any of this without your support! <a href=""/donate"">Please consider becoming a PennFuture member today.</a><br /></p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Abigail M.

Planting Trees and Fighting for Funding in the Keystone State,10/29/2021,"<p>It might be the best way to clean our water. Planting trees along rivers and streams provides multiple benefits in the work to protect and restore our rivers and streams. Known as riparian buffers, they prevent pollution from entering waterways, stabilize stream banks, and provide critical habitat, shade, and food for critters. Whats more, its also one of the most cost-effective ways to improve water quality.</p><p>For all these reasons, PennFuture was thrilled to partner with the Choose Clean Water Coalition andthe Alliance for the Chesapeake Bayto host its first on-the-ground restoration event. Gathering on a Plain Sect dairy farm in Lancaster County on October 13, a group of 20 volunteers planted approximately 600 trees as part of a two-acre buffer on a direct tributary to the Conestoga River.</p><p>Buffers like this are an important part of Pennsylvanias Phase 3 Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) and are effective in both rural and suburban areas. According to the Phase 3 WIP, Pennsylvania has committed to plant more than 85,000 acres of buffers at a cost of $28 million annually. This would greatly improve local water quality by preventing 16 percent of nitrogen and 41 percent of phosphorous pollution from reaching our waterways. According to the 2021 numeric milestones, Pennsylvania has planted only 42 percent of its forest buffer goal.</p><p>But buffers are just one of many practices Pennsylvania has agreed to implement by 2025. Other necessary projects, such as manure storage, are much more expensive. Fortunately, in the Pennsylvania General Assembly there are two proposed pieces of legislation with broad bipartisan support that would invest a combined $750 million dollars of the American Rescue Plan Act funding in clean water programs.</p><p><u><strong>Growing Greener III</strong></u></p><p>First passed in 1999 with bipartisan support, Growing Greener continues to receive overwhelming public support today. In 2020, a poll commissioned by Conservation Voters of PA and the Growing Greener Coalition showed that nearly 90 percent of voters support funding for Pennsylvanias land, water, and wildlife, even during the economic downturn of the COVID-19 pandemic. Growing Greener funding provides critical support to community-driven work in our communities through grant programs at the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the PA Department of Agriculture. A boost of $500 million, as proposed in Senate Bill 525, from American Rescue Plan funding is much needed for this program.</p><p><u><strong>Clean Streams Fund</strong></u></p><p>But to reach its clean water goals, Pennsylvania must also invest state funds into clean water programs. A piece of legislation currently moving through the Pennsylvania state legislature would provide another source of crucial support to improve the Keystone States waterways. The Clean Streams Fund (SB 832 and HB 1901) proposes $250 million in dedicated funding from the American Rescue Plan to create new clean water programs, including the Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program. This program would provide farmers funding to implement conservation practices on their land. Of Pennsylvanias 50,000+ farms, 98 percent of them are family-owned with an average net cash farm income of $42,020. With agriculture as the number one source of water pollution in Pennsylvania, the state must help farmers effectively steward their land by investing in conservation practices.</p><p><u><strong>A Worthwhile Investment</strong></u></p><p>The dairy farm where we planted the riparian buffer on October 13 is part of the Sustainable Dairy Pennsylvania project, a collaboration between The Hershey Company, Land O Lakes, and the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay focused on supporting a more sustainable and climate-friendly dairy supply chain in Pennsylvania for Hersheys Milk Chocolate.But getting conservation practices on-the-ground isnt free. Using American Rescue Plan funding through the Growing Greener III and passing the Clean Streams Fund will provide much needed assistance to our farmers. As many farmers have shared with us, by planting buffers and implementing other conservation practices, they are doing their part to ensure clean water for now and future generations.</p><p>We look forward to getting our hands dirty again at another planting, but until then, we will keep up the fight to ensure all Pennsylvanian farmers have the necessary resources to effectively steward their land and leave a legacy of clean water.</p>",Climate; Community; Environment,"Renee Reber, Campaign Manager, Watershed Advocacy"
"Plastics Could Soon Overtake Coal as a Climate Killer, and Pennsylvania is Right in the Middle of It",10/26/2021,"<p>A report released on Oct. 21 by Beyond Plastics <a href=""https://www.beyondplastics.org/plastics-and-climate"">predicted dire consequences</a> as a result of our inability to stop consuming plastics. Specifically, the report's authors claim that the domestic plastics industry's contribution to climate change is on track to exceed that of coal-fired power in this country by 2030.</p><p>We've known for years that our oceans and other water bodies <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trash-removed-from-great-pacific-garbage-patch/"">are choked with unfathomable amounts of plastics pollution</a>, and that the process to create those plastics is dependent on fossil fuels, namely fracked gas. Even in an increasingly climate-conscious world, more than 300 million tons of plastic are produced each year,<a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/stories/single-use-plastics-101"">half of which is consumed as single-use</a>-products used once and tossed away (i.e. plastic bags), often finding their way to sidewalks, waterways, and green spaces.</p><p>This isn't some far-away problem. The Keystone State is, after all, about to be home to the world's newest plastics factory once Shell Chemical's ethane cracker plant in Beaver County comes online sometime next year, a plant that is predicted to <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/shell-ethane-cracker-pennsylvania/shell-says-pennsylvania-ethane-cracker-about-70-complete-idUKL1N2H00V3"">churn out 1.6 million tons of plastic annually.</a> The plant won't just be responsible for introducing <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/plastics-appalachia-next-cancer-alley-fracking-public-health-ethane"">massive amounts of single-use plastic into the world</a>, but it will also pump <a href=""https://www.environmentalhealthproject.org/blog/the-health-behind-plastics-cracker-plants"">more than 30 tons of hazardous air pollutants</a>, 323 tons of fine particles, and 522 tons of volatile organic compounds into our air each year.</p><p>According to the Beyond Plastics report, therein lies the problem: the U.S. plastics industry already emits at least 232 million tons of greenhouse gases annually, which is equal to the emissions of 116 average-sized coal-fired power plants. Those numbers will increase significantly in the coming years-Shell's ethane cracker plant is only one of five cracker projects under construction or in the planning phases in the United States.</p><p>In total, at least 42 plastics facilities have opened, are under construction, or are in the permitting phase since 2019. If all of them <a href=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eda91260bbb7e7a4bf528d8/t/616ef29221985319611a64e0/1634661022294/REPORT_The_New-Coal_Plastics_and_Climate-Change_10-21-2021.pdf"">become fully operational</a>, they could cumulatively have the impact of 27 500-megawatt coal-fired power plants coming online by 2025.</p><p>The bottom line is that the petrochemical industry is slated to surpass coal in terms of climate-killing emissions by 2030 and Pennsylvania's dreams of becoming a petrochemical and plastics ""hub"" is part of the problem. We're building on our longer history of polluting and destructive industries-timber, oil, coal, and fracked gas-with plastics.</p><p>Massive ethane cracker facilities aren't the only culprits. The report specifically called out another sector of the plastics industry that Pennsylvanians should be familiar with: chemical recycling, sometimes referred to as ""advanced recycling,"" a complex process that involves turning plastic waste into fuel.</p><p>To be clear, despite the name, this is not true recycling of plastics in which plastics are turned into other plastics. Instead, it would take plastic waste, break it down to its chemical constituents, and burn it as a source of fuel (with associated air quality emissions).</p><p>Though there are only a few chemical recycling facilities operational across the country, one is being proposed right here in Pennsylvania, in Erie. It's not currently clear what kinds of pollution could result from the Erie facility-all of the plastic sent to this facility will be turned into tiny flakes, half of which will be shipped or trucked to Canada and burned in steel mills. At this time, it is also unclear where the other half of the flaked plastic trash will go.</p><p>We do know, however, that it's estimated that the facility will require <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/articles/a-rust-belt-city-debates-a-growing-plastic-future/"">about 400 truckloads of plastic per day</a> to stay profitable. We also know that chemical recycling facilities in the United States are predicted to be responsible for releasing 18 million tons of greenhouse gases annually, equivalent to nine coal-fired power plants.</p><p>The report paints a very dim picture of our ongoing relationship with plastics, and though Pennsylvania plays a significant role in this crisis, work is underway to fight back.</p><p>PennFuture is one of several groups that's been <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/environmentalists-critical-of-natural-gas-storage-hub-in-southwest-pa-regional-plan/Content?oid=15288269"">working for years</a> to beat back attempts to turn Appalachia into a plastics hub. The Shell plant may be online soon, but other similar facilities planned for the region <a href=""https://businessjournaldaily.com/pttgc-delays-decision-on-belmont-cracker-plant/"">have been put on hold indefinitely</a> because of pushback from communities, and because of unfavorable market conditions as the world slowly becomes more climate-conscious.</p><p>Progress can be seen in other nearby states, too. People in the state of New York <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/plastic-pollution-climate-change-1245402/"">once used 23 billion single-use plastic bags</a> annually, a number that is in steep decline because of a ban on plastic bags. PennFuture is supporting <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/phillys-plastic-bag-ban-is-finally-here-with-enforcement-still-to-come/"">a similar effort underway</a> in Philadelphia, and the hope is that the entire state could soon follow in banning plastic bags.</p><p>Finally, community members in Erie <a href=""https://www.eriereader.com/article/questions-surround-the-plasticity-of-our-city"">are questioning the viability</a> of the chemical recycling plant planned there, and many voices of civic society have foughtback against <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/report-pa-s-fossil-fuel-industry-received-3-7-billion-in-tax-breaks-in-2019/"">any new subsidies for plastics and fossil fuels.</a></p><p>Our world might be trending in the wrong direction in terms of our plastics addiction, but we're still fighting.

DEP Should Revoke Permits for Troubled Mariner East Pipeline,10/19/2021,"<p>On October 5, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced 48 criminal charges related to construction of the Mariner East pipeline project, including one felony count of failing to report pollution. Yes, you read correctly, a corporation is facing criminal charges for its behavior. So how did we get here, and what does that mean for Mariner East, its parent company Energy Transfer, and Pennsylvania? Read on.</p><p>Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based pipeline company building the Mariner East pipeline, has been plagued by a litany of problems. The pipeline project <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Problem-with-Pipelines"">has been rife with issues for years</a>, and this most recent evidence has shown that despite the numerous fines and temporary shutdowns Energy Transfer has faced from the Department of Environmental Protection, these issues have continued unabated, reaching a level where the Pennsylvania Attorney General himself took notice.</p><p>After a years-long investigation, a grand jury released its findings. The report details the numerous serious environmental harms that took place at specific locations across Pennsylvania, including Raystown Lake, Loyalhanna Lake, and Marsh Creek Lake. Highlights <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-10-05-Mariner-East-Presentment.pdf"">of the 64 page document include</a>:</p><ul><li>In its rush to begin construction, ""Sunoco and its prime contractors hired HDD subcontractors from across the country who were unfamiliar with Pennsylvania geology and water features as well as the regulatory landscape that existed in the state. The subcontractors applied their standard practices to an unusual environment, which resulted in environmental impacts."" And that ""In addition to the problematic geology, this former Sunoco employee indicated that the people hired to do the work were young and with limited actual experience. Leaks and spills of drilling fluid began to occur almost immediately.""</li><li>Elsewhere, in Indiana County, drilling was stopped after the DEP issued a Notice of Violation due to another spill. The day after work resumed, there was another spill, which was not reported. This exact story was replayed later in the report at a site in Cambria County: a large spill, contaminated wetlands, work stoppage after a DEP Notice, with the only result that ""the same thing happened again the next day.""</li><li>The scale of the leaks is difficult to wrap one's head around: these were not small and minor leaks of only a few gallons of toxic drilling fluid. At one site, near the William Penn Highway, a loss of 65,000 gallons of drilling fluid went unreported. Imagine nine yellow school buses lined up next to each other. This was not a small amount of water by any stretch, and it happened again and again.</li><li>The report details testimony from a number of homeowners that Energy Transfer threatened to take their homes if they didn't give Energy Transfer the right to build the pipeline across their land, sometimes promising they wouldn't feel the effects of construction. Later, Energy Transfer threatened to take their houses when those whose water had been ruined tried to assert their rights.</li><li>On top of leaking drilling fluid across the state, Energy Transfer used unapproved chemicals in that drilling fluid, meaning that not only did they leak chemicals into people's wells and lakes, they did not even have permission to use those chemicals in the first place.</li></ul><p>All of these massive, systemic, and ongoing problems were carefully recorded by inspectors and geologists on site. These records were simply unreported to the DEP.</p><p>Further, and even more offensive, is that Energy Transfer straight-up lied to the DEP about the incidents: In an April 24, 2019 letter to DEP, Sunoco claimed that, due to inadvertent miscommunication, its management never learned of the losses of fluid. However, the evidence before the Grand Jury clearly indicated that this claim was ""false."" In fact, a project manager for one drilling subcontractor told the Grand Jury that if something was not reported, it was not because people were not there to see it. Another Construction Manager testified that it was ""preposterous"" for someone to imply that Energy Transfer's environmental team was unaware. Despite the citizen complaints, the obvious spills, and its own records, Energy Transfer tried to claim they somehow went unaware.</p><p>As the infamous saying goes, ""Who're you gonna believe: me, or your own lying eyes?""</p><p>The numerous, severe, repeated violations noted by the Grand Jury report-the details span over 50 pages-only encompass a mere 16% of the total number of horizontal drilling sites of the project. One wonders how long the Grand Jury report would be if even half of the sites were investigated.</p><p>So what does all this mean? First, we applaud the Attorney General for taking action against Energy Transfer, to try and bring some greater consequence to Energy Transfer, and to shine a brighter light onto their multitude of transgressions. It isn't often that corporations themselves are held accountable for their actions, and we believe this to be a good step in the right direction here. Ultimately, we need to strengthen the laws themselves so that when the Attorney General needs to prosecute, they have a stronger sword with which to do so.</p><p>Second, one of the other crucial takeaways from the Grand Jury Report is that the Department of Environmental Protection was entirely too under-resourced to be able to effectively administer and oversee the level of violations here. This shows something that matches our common sense: it isn't enough to simply pass regulations, but the agencies charged with carrying out laws and regulations must be provided with enough resources to effectively oversee them.</p><p>However, the Department of Environmental Protection can still take swift and decisive action here to prevent even more harm. A number of advocates have called for the DEP to terminate Energy Transfer's environmental permit, which allows them to do the work that is leaving a trail of environmental ruin and carnage in its wake.</p><p>The legal standard for the Department of Environmental Protection to terminate a permit is simple: When a permittee either has been shown to be in noncompliance with any condition of their permit, or the permittee misrepresents ""any relevant facts at any time,"" a permit can be terminated. How does this process start? That is also simple: either a person submits a written request that the permit be terminated, or information showing that there has been noncompliance is brought to the DEP's attention, and they can take action of their own accord. The DEP can then begin the process of terminating the permit. It is clear that this simple legal standard has been met.</p><p>The Department of Environmental Protection should terminate the permits associated with the Mariner East pipeline immediately.</p><p>So what can you do today? <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/marinereast2permits/index.html"">Write to your representatives</a>, and ask them to increase funding for long term oversight of environmental permits, and ask them what they are doing to make sure that Energy Transfer is not allowed to further poison the water and resources of hard working Pennsylvanians.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Emma Bast, Staff Attorney"

It's Past Time for Pennsylvania to Invest in Renewable Energy,10/5/2021,"<p>On October 4, 2021, the Pennsylvania State Senate Environmental Resources & Energy Committee and the Senate Community, Economic & Recreational Development Committee held a joint-committee hearing titled ""Consumer & Economic Impacts of Failing to Invest in PAs Natural Gas Infrastructure.""</p><p>Instead of highlighting the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry over the past few decades, how it has led to the degradation of our shared environment, and the subsequent harmful effects on our health, the Majority Chairs quickly began dismissing these issues, pointing fingers at the ""radical environmental left,"" and scapegoating other countries.</p><p>Experts have stated repeatedly that merely pointing out that other, industrialized countries are also sources of high carbon pollution does not absolve the US of responsibility or somehow make any attempts by the US to reduce their carbon emissions meaningless. Also, many scapegoaters, including those leading the hearing yesterday afternoon, leave out key facts about these aforementioned countries.</p><p>China plans to increase their share of non-fossil fuel energy consumption <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/trump-admin-scapegoats-china-india-satisfy-polluters"">to 20 percent by 2030</a>. China is already the world leader in new installations <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/13/china-and-us-lead-way-with-wind-power-installations-says-global-energy-report.html"">of wind</a> and <a href=""http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2017/01/06/china-five-year-plan-energy-solar-record-2016/"">solar power</a>. India is increasing their share of non-fossil fuel energy consumption to 40 percent by 2030. India plans to add <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/sameer-kwatra/india-joins-paris-agreement-climate-change"">175 gigawatts of renewable energy</a> by 2022. Also, India plans to reduce emissions intensity 33 to 35 percent by 2030 based on 2005 levels. The US must do its part to reduce its carbon footprint because the average emissions for every American <a href=""http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts_pc1990-2015"">is eight times that of the average Indian citizen</a>. Similarly, the emissions per person in China <a href=""http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts_pc1990-2015"">is only half that</a>of the average American, and a bit more than residents of the EU. Overall, the average emissions per American <a href=""http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts_pc1990-2015"">are three times higher</a> than the global average.</p><p>However, as is the position of PennFuture, the burden to curb carbon emissions is not on the average individual, but on producers and polluters -- namely the fossil fuel industry.</p><p>In February 2021, PennFuture released the third edition of our <a href=""/files/galleries/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">Fossil Fuel Subsidy Report</a>. In this report, we uncovered that Pennsylvania provided $3.8 billion in fossil fuel subsidies in Fiscal Year 2019 by systematically disabling many of its standard tools for collecting tax revenues, allowing the industry to extract public resources at little to no charge, and awarding the industry grants and tax credits. Meanwhile, in the same time period, the industry imposed $11.1 billion worth external costs to the state and its residents. These facts alone plainly show the nonsensical nature of the premise of the hearing itself; it was a waste of taxpayer money that is better served being invested in our workers, our environment, and our future. It is more than clear to us that Pennsylvania's continued investment in the fracked gas industry is harmful to workers, businesses, and the general public.</p><p>We recognize the need to secure the livelihood of Pennsylvanians, especially in this volatile time as the country as a whole begins the long road of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we also recognize that this recovery period is a source of opportunity. Pennsylvania, as many other states and nations already have, can leap to the forefront of the new, clean energy economy and provide hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs in a diverse number of sectors for the people across this great Commonwealth.</p><p>A better path forward doesn't lie in some far-off future, it is already here, and it is time for our great Commonwealth to seize this opportunity through heavily and seriously investing in the New Clean Economy.</p><p><u>Transitioning to the New Clean Economy is Good for the Overall Economic Development in Pennsylvania</u></p><p>A major point made by the leaders of yesterday's hearing was how going after the fossil fuel industry would result in higher costs to the consumer and a loss of jobs for the workers in the industry. However, these leaders conveniently leave out, time and time again, that carbon-polluting jobs <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2020/06/05/pandemic-accelerates-decline-and-fall-of-fossil-fuel-producers/?sh=6689dc97f639"">have been on the decline</a> as the industry itself continues to give way to the new, clean energy economy. They also fail to mention how clean energy is, in many cases, cheaper to produce (and thus cheaper to the consumer) than fossil fuel-based energy. It would be in the best interests of labor unions and their workers alike to embrace the new economy, which offers <a href=""https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/09/how-much-do-energy-industry-jobs-pay-a-look-at-the-data/"">better job security</a>, increasing wages, and is overall beneficial to the environment and general public.</p><p>In a blog post from August <a href=""/Blog-Item-What-You-Wont-Hear-During-the-Aug-17-Public-Hearing-on-Pipelines-in-Pennsylvania"">about a similar hearing held in the State House</a>, I discussed how greener, more environmentally friendly energy alternatives are already proving to not only be both <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=5128549c2c84"">cost effective for producers and consumers</a>, but also offer <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimmagill/2020/10/26/oil-gas-vs-clean-energy-which-will-have-best-jobs-in-the-future/?sh=51d9704c5738"">higher-paying wages</a> for those in the green energy job sector.

By 2030, US wind and solar is on track to generate more than $60 billion in annual revenue-on par with the three leading US agricultural commodities: corn ($58 billion), soy ($44 billion), and beef production ($70 billion). Analysis conducted for RMI's Seeds of Opportunity report indicates that the projected 600 GW of new wind and solar projects built between 2020 and 2030 <a href=""https://rmi.org/insight/seeds-of-opportunity/"">would generate $220 billion in direct, lifetime economic benefits</a>. This is a gamechanger for Rural America, of which much of Pennsylvania falls into.</p><p>Specifically, onshore wind and utility-scale solar projects can result in $2.7 billion in tax revenues collected by local governments annually; $2.2 billion collected in land lease payments to rural landowners hosting turbines or panels on their property; $2.3 billion in construction jobs and wages; and $3.7 billion in operations and maintenance jobs and wages, <a href=""https://rmi.org/renewables-offer-rural-america-the-economic-development-opportunity-of-a-generation/"">all occurring annually by 2030</a>.<br /> As America faces an economy post-COVID 19, the green energy sector presents an avenue to create jobs on a massive, interstate scale <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/09/10/how-clean-energy-jobs-can-power-an-equitable-covid-19-recovery/"">that includes a diverse workforce of people</a> with varying levels of education and skill set.</p><p>In July 2020, PennFuture released a report titled <a href=""/Files/Admin/Green-Stimulus-FINAL.pdf"">A Green Stimulus and Recovery Platform for Pennsylvania</a> which detailed how transitioning to a green energy future would preserve or create 389,000 good paying and environmentally sustainable jobs in a variety of sectors and types such as tourism, blue-collar, and white-collar jobs-including detailed steps our legislature can take to make this a reality. Such a new economy cannot be realized without proper investment, and Pennsylvania, facing the brunt of the dying fossil fuel industry, is the perfect place to rise to the moment and invest.</p><p>Pennsylvania has a legacy of environmental damage from extractive industries including timber, oil, coal, and gas. In response, we passed a Constitutional amendment, Pa. Const. Art. I § 27, acknowledging our fundamental right to clean air and pure water and requiring that the government act as a trustee with the duty to conserve and maintain our environment and our shared public natural resources. The threats associated with climate change only add to the urgency of this duty.</p><p>Instead of doubling down on an unsustainable and dirty fracked gas industry, Pennsylvania must work to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote alternatives such as energy efficiency and clean renewable energy. To do so, we must align our investments with our goals and avoid unintended side effects that promote pollution and poison our communities and our workers. This is a significant undertaking, but as a start PennFuture recommends the following:</p><ul><li>Regular and ongoing evaluation of the costs and benefits of the fracked gas and fossil fuel subsidies: As time and technology changes, subsidies that were once justified may no longer make sense. Regular reconsideration of existing subsidies is needed to ensure we are spending money wisely and working towards our goals.</li><li>Engaging in discussions with statewide, national, and international leaders in the renewable energy space: As renewable energy companies continue to establish themselves as leaders in the ever-growing clean energy economy, it would be wise for Pennsylvania economic development leaders to engage in job-creation centered dialogue in order to foster a robust and diverse clean energy sector in this great Commonwealth.</li></ul><p>We believe Pennsylvania can build a vibrant and growing economy on clean and renewable energy. We ask our lawmakers to take the needs of all Pennsylvanians seriously, do the right thing, and lead us to that New Clean Economic future by investing in renewable energy industries and jobs.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"John Ukenye, Policy Analyst"
PennEast Pipeline is Cancelled!,9/30/2021,"<p>Earlier this week it was announced that the PennEast Pipeline company <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/penneast-end-development-pennsylvania-new-jersey-natgas-pipe-2021-09-27/"">will cease development of its proposed fracked gas pipeline</a> determining that ""further development of the project no longer is supported."" The 120-mile, 36-inch diameter pipeline, which was slated to run from Luzerne County in northeast Pennsylvania through the Delaware River watershed to New Jersey, was unable to get all necessary environmental permits.</p><p>PennFuture responded to this announcement <a href=""/News-PennFuture-Responds-to-PennEast-Pipeline-Cancelation"">with relief for our environment and communities</a> and thanks for everyone who fought against this pipeline!</p><p>The decision to cease development of the PennEast pipeline came as a welcome surprise, especially since the company <a href=""/Blog-Item-Supreme-Court-Ruled-Natural-Gas-Companies-Can-Condemn-State-Owned-Land"">just won a big case</a> with the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed the company to use eminent domain on state-owned or controlled lands in New Jersey. We knew something was going on when, despite that win, PennEast decided to <a href=""https://www.mcall.com/news/pennsylvania/mc-nws-pa-penneast-pipeline-eminent-domain-halted-20210810-q3ub2gijazgxthvetqd4sqn2qa-story.html"">stop condemnation proceedings</a> in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p><p>Condemnation occurs when the private property is taken for public use and the landowner is given ""fair market value"" for that property. In 2017, we joined with Save Carbon County and others to <a href=""/Blog-Item-Environmental-Impacts-and-the-PennEast-Pipeline"">highlight the unfair practices</a> in which pipeline companies may condemn private lands for pipeline right-of-ways even before the pipeline route is finalized. Once condemned, the pipeline company may access the property to do surveys and <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/07/03/family-lost-hundreds-of-trees-to-failed-pipeline-project-settles-with-company-gets-land-back/"">may even destroy some of the natural resources</a> on the land, like by clearcutting trees along the proposed right-of-way.</p><p>In addition, PennFuture has been concerned with the PennEast pipeline's environmental impacts since its inception in 2014. Impacts from the PennEast pipeline would have included degradation of streams, including special protection waters; loss of high functioning wetlands; destruction of forest habitat and increased invasive species; and increased greenhouse gas emissions, among other things. PennFuture - both individually as well as with others, including our key partners Delaware Riverkeeper Network (DRN) and Clean Air Council - have submitted numerous public comments opposing the various federal and state approvals the PennEast pipeline needed. Additionally, among other actions taken, PennFuture intervened in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and our ally DRN has brought numerous legal challenges against PennEast.</p><p>Many other local, regional, state, and federal groups fought against the destructive PennEast pipeline. As result of this strong opposition, New Jersey had recently denied critical environmental permits for the pipeline. This caused PennEast to propose to bifurcate its process and build the PA-only portion of the pipeline in phases to allow for construction to move forward, despite it being a <a href=""/Files/Admin/PennEast-Chs.-102---105-Comments-Jan.-2021-.pdf"">pipeline to nowhere</a>, as PennFuture pointed out in our comments on the ""Phase One Amendment"" proposal. And while PennEast <a href=""https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/allentown/2021/09/penneast-pipeline-co-halts-its-natural-gas-transmission-line-crossing-lehigh-valley.html"">has stated</a> that it is ""examining the proper next steps in the regulatory process as it pertains to the Phase One Amendment pending at FERC,"" we believe that the PennEast pipeline is dead in PA.</p><p>No doubt that the sustained legal, regulatory, and outreach efforts of PennFuture and our partners resulted in the necessary delay of construction of this project. And New Jersey's forceful recognition of the environmental harms of this pipeline and their denial of key permits was critical to PennEast inability to quickly push this pipeline through. But I don't think we can overlook the fact that this decision came from PennEast - and not the courts. This appears to be a business decision rather than a conclusive legal holding that the pipeline cannot be built. Because we are now at a time when market forces show that investment in fracked gas <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fracked-Gas-Petrochemical-Industries-Continue-to-Overpromise-and-Underdeliver-for-Pennsylvanians​"">is no longer as profitable as it once was</a>, such fierce and coordinated opposition seems to be working to halt the fracked gas industry from proposing facilities that may be operating on the margins.</p><p>But Pennsylvanians cannot rely on market forces, private business decisions, or other states to protect us from harmful fracked gas and petrochemical facilities. Our Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) must do everything it can to live up to its name and protect Pennsylvania's environment. The DEP is a trustee under <a href=""https://blogs.law.widener.edu/envirolawcenter/files/2010/03/PA_Citizens_Guide_to_Art_I_Sect_27.pdf"">PA's Environmental Rights Amendment</a> (ERA), Article I, Section 27 of our state constitution. The ERA puts our right to ""clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment"" on par with other First Amendment rights like free speech. Thus, DEP must take seriously its fiduciary obligation to ""conserve and maintain [Pennsylvania's public natural resources] for the benefit of all the people.""</p><p>To continue to issue approvals to an industry that we have seen <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/mariner-east-2/"">time</a> and <a href=""https://www.fractracker.org/2021/03/shells-falcon-pipeline-under-investigation-for-serious-public-safety-threats/"">time</a> and <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/09/10/natural-gas-pipeline-blast-in-beaver-county-prompts-evacuation/"">time again</a> destroy our environment and threaten the health and safety of our communities violates that fiduciary duty of the trustee. Rather, DEP must look critically at applications and promises made and must use its permitting process to ensure that construction and operation of pipelines will not harm our environment. DEP must continue to issue strong enforcement actions against these companies when - and in PA it appears to be when, not if - they destroy our waters, our lands, our communities.</p><p>To end on a positive note, PennFuture is very happy that the PennEast pipeline no longer seems to be a threat in Pennsylvania. This news is a huge relief for PennFuture and the impacted communities across the Delaware River watershed who have been tirelessly working to defeat this terrible pipeline. We couldn't have gotten here without the support of our partners, supporters, and <a href=""/donate"">members.</a> And we will continue to fight to protect our communities from the harmful impacts of the fracked gas and petrochemical industries.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Abigail M.

When Profits are on the Line: The Fight Over Energy Markets,9/29/2021,"<p>Having energy available when we flip on a light switch is a complicated business and making the wrong choices can have serious consequences. In Pennsylvania, these choices are often made by our Regional Transmission Organization (RTO)-a nonprofit organization known as <a href=""https://www.pjm.com/"">PJM Interconnection</a>.They manage a large marketplace providing services in an area touching 13 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>In the short term, many key decisions are made through auctions.PJM forecasts how much energy we will need tomorrow, and generators bid to see who can provide that energy at the lowest cost. The cheapest generators clear the auction and everyone receives the market clearing price.If additional energy is needed over the course of a day, PJM also has a spot market that runs a similar auction every five minutes.<br /><br /> While this system works very well and most generators make the bulk of their revenue from these markets, it doesn't provide any long-term price signals to ensure the capacity we need is built and maintained.Relying only on short-term markets to influence long-term behavior is a bad idea-this was one of the primary causes of the <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/why-texas-power-grid-failed-2eaa659d2ac29ff87eb9220875f23b34"">high-profile and catastrophic failures</a> the Texas grid experienced in recent months.Fortunately, PJM doesn't follow the Texas plan.</p><p>PJM has what is known as a Capacity Market in addition to the energy markets.Under the Capacity Market, generators who clear the market commit to be available, if needed, three years in the future in exchange for set payments.They receive the capacity payments whether or not they actually are called upon to deliver energy, but they are also liable for penalties if they are not able to run when called.This gives them both time to plan and incentives to be reliable.</p><p>Prior to December 2019, PJM was concerned that some market participants with buyer-side market power could manipulate the market.For example, a load-serving entity that built new power plants could dump new generation into the capacity market at artificially low prices. They might lose money on those plants, but if it drove the market clearing price low enough, they could more than make up for those losses buying the capacity they need at cheaper prices.To prevent this sort of manipulation, PJM set a price floor for certain new generation.They called this the Minimum Offer Price Rule or ""MOPR."" (pronounced mōp-er)</p><p><u>Overreaches of authority</u></p><p>Since 2019, another type of possible market influence arose.Maryland wanted to encourage new in-state generation so it created a program where a company would bid into the PJM capacity market but, in addition to its capacity revenue, it would also receive out-of-market payments to make up the difference between the market clearing price and a pre-arrange contract price.The Supreme Court <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-614_k5fm.pdf"">rejected this program</a>, holding that Maryland's plan disregarded an interstate wholesale rate required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).</p><p>This decision was very limited.Although it rejected a type of market influence by the state, the Court explicitly said that ""Nothing in this opinion should be read to foreclose...states from encouraging production of new or clean generation...so long as a state does not condition payment of funds on capacity clearing the auction.""</p><p>Unfortunately, then President Trump's FERC ignored this clarification and claimed that practically any effort by the state to make policy decisions about their resource mix ""threaten[s] the competitiveness of the capacity market."" As a result of this new FERC decision, PJM was ordered to expand the MOPR well beyond the initial purpose of limiting buyer-side market power.The expanded MOPR would include practically any ""state-subsidized"" resource, whether or not the subsidy was conditioned on a generator clearing the capacity market.These targeted subsidies would have a disproportionate impact on new clean renewable generation like those sources benefiting from Pennsylvania's alternative energy portfolio standards (AEPS), forcing new clean resources to bid into the capacity market at uncompetitively high prices.</p><p>Rather than supporting an efficient market, this created a fiction where PJM would effectively pretend that these clean resources didn't exist.Not only would that raise the capacity prices across the board, it also meant ratepayers would be forced to pay for more capacity than was actually needed.Or, as PJM put it ""attempting to 'hermetically seal' the capacity market from the reality of state policies...effects an over-correction that itself works against the determination of just and reasonable rates.""By 2030, this could mean $2 billion per year in excess payments that would largely flow into the coffers of polluting generators and extend the life of uncompetitive and unneeded fossil fuel plants.</p><p>""But prices didn't increase in our last capacity auction!"" comes the cry from the polluters.In reality, that is a distraction rather than a vindication for the expanded MOPR.First, because of the various changes, PJM delayed the last auction for two years allowing for a much more accurate forecast of needed capacity and the need for less reserves, as a result, they bought 2.5GW less capacity saving ratepayers <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/tom-rutigliano/how-save-four-billion-without-really-trying"">over $4 billion</a>. Second, the vast majority of existing resources were grandfathered, so no one seriously expected the MOPR to show large effects in the first few auctions anyway. While ratepayers did get a huge break, the MOPR system was still broken.</p><p>While all four of the current FERC commissioners were appointed by the former President, it is a very different body than it was in 2019.Right now, there is an even split with two Democrats and two Republicans, and a fifth commissioner-a third Democrat-has been nominated by President Biden and is expected to be confirmed by the Senate later this year.President Biden also named Commissioner Richard Glick, who dissented in the prior opinion, as the new Chairman replacing Niel Chatterjee.</p><p>With the expanded MOPR deeply unpopular and support at FERC for that approach waning, PJM saw the handwriting on the wall and, earlier this year, held a series of workshops to discuss alternatives.This ended with the consideration of nine different proposals to reform the MOPR.After putting the options to various stakeholder groups, PJM's own plan was clearly the most popular.</p><p>This would only apply the MOPR to facilities that actually exercised buyer side market power or those receiving ""conditioned state support""-the narrow category specifically identified by the Supreme Court. PJM proposed to adopt this plan in July and, with the FERC commissioners split two against two on the change, FERC took no action.The revisions <a href=""https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_num=20210929-3009"">became effective by operation of law</a> on September 29, 2021.</p><p><u>Panic from the fossil fuel industry</u></p><p>PJM revising a fairly obscure rule in a way that would save ratepayers billions of dollars doesn't seem controversial, but shortly before the new rule took effect, the PA House Environmental Resources and Energy (ERE) Committee, led by the irascible Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, held an entire hearing to rail against this new plan and the danger of ""subsidies"".He seemed to be under the impression that this was somehow orchestrated by President Biden even though Trump appointed all of the current FERC commissioners. (Richard Glick, who Daryl kept referring to as ""Biden's appointee,"" was the Trump appointee who Biden named as Chairman.)</p><p>The following day the PA State Senate ERE committee held a meeting on the same topic, with largely the same speakers.Many Senators also took the opportunity to object to other states investing in new renewable generation even though doing so would actually lower electricity costs for their constituents.</p><p>Why would two legislative committees feel the need to go on record advocating for a plan to raise their constituent's electric bills right before an election year? If you suspect the fossil fuel industry has a hand in this, you would be right.</p><p>While it's a good thing we don't follow the Texas model and rely on short-term markets to drive investments, our Capacity Market has its own problems, perhaps the biggest of which is systematic over-procurement.</p><p>Take for example the Cheswick coal-fired power plant in Allegheny County.In 2020 it was only called upon to run at less than 10% of its rated capacity.That is like a restaurant only opening its doors for just over a month each year-not a sustainable business.With such poor sales, capacity payments may have accounted for most of its revenue and, if it didn't clear the capacity auction and lost those guaranteed payments, it wouldn't make sense to stay open. It's not surprising then that just days after the 2022/23 Capacity Auction results were published, it was announced Cheswick would retire.</p><p>An analysis by PJM concluded that its <a href=""https://pjm.com/planning/services-requests/gen-deactivations.aspx"">retirement won't create any reliability issues</a>, but that raises a bigger question.Why did we pay around $20 million to keep a plant in service that barely generated any electricity and wasn't actually needed anyway?The simple answer is systematic over-procurement.</p><p>While PJM says <a href=""https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/blog/Wilson%20Overprocurement%20of%20Capacity%20in%20PJM.PDF"">reserve margins in the range of 16% of their forecasted peak load</a> are adequate, their actual reserve margins are often over 20%, that alone results in about 15GW of unneeded capacity being bought each year.When we look back at the actual peak load, their reserve margins have been running closer to 30%.In short, ratepayers are spending literally billions of dollars to buy far more capacity than we need-even in a worst case scenario.</p><p>In response to this illusionary ""demand"" for capacity, generators had an incentive to increase supply.Over-procurement supports overbuilding of fossil resources.Now, as clean and renewable energy <a href=""https://www.lazard.com/perspective/lcoe2020"">keeps getting cheaper</a>, fossil fuel owners and investors are faced with an increasingly competitive energy market and are desperate to keep these guaranteed payments coming in to pad the bottom line.Or, in the dry language of PJM's filing, the expanded MOPR ""foments greater revenue reliance by resources on the capacity market, rather than the energy and reserves markets, contrary to the original design of restructured wholesale electricity markets.""In other words, the rule created a bubble of unneeded capacity. Like any market bubble lacking fundamental underlying support, this could suddenly collapse if fossil fuel interests don't defend it.</p><p>Ignoring the value of clean energy on public health and the environment is central to their plan.In this view, paying for clean generation is a ""subsidy"" but being allowed to pollute for free isn't, even if the amount others are paying for the damage is massive.</p><p>Another fossil-fuel strategy has been to pretend only fossil fuel power is valuable as a capacity resource.While it's true that a solar facility isn't going to operate at night and will produce less electricity on cloudy days, we've seen in Texas and during our own polar vortex that fossil fuel plants aren't necessarily available when we need them either.While having variable resources complicates the management of our power grid, this is a well-understood issue <a href=""https://www.pjm.com/planning/resource-adequacy-planning/effective-load-carrying-capability"">that we can account for.</a></p><p>The expanded MOPR took this all a step further and effectively pretended that much of the new clean generation wouldn't exist at all. For fossil fuel plants, that means all of those capacity dollars flow to their pockets and not to their competitors.Reforming the MOPR not only threatened them with more competition, it drew attention to the more fundamental issue of overprocuremt.If PJM fixes that problem, the ratepayers will benefit but uneconomical and unnecessary fossil fuel plants will lose their safety net.That has them, and their friends in the legislature, in a panic.</p><p>For polluters and their friends, forcing higher bills on ratepayers is a small price to pay when profits are on the line.</p>",,
Climate Goals Remain Elusive and Will Require Bold Action,9/23/2021,"<p>It is fitting that Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection on Wednesday released an updated version of its <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/citizens/climate/Pages/PA-Climate-Action-Plan.aspx?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444"">Climate Action Plan</a> (CAP), which provides insight into the progress being made on Gov. Tom Wolf's climate goals. This is <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/its-climate-week-again-but-the-calendar-is-running-out"">Climate Week</a>, after all, a time when activists across the world hold marches and rallies to bring attention to the most pressing issue of our time: the climate crisis.</p><p>As the <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/08/06/pennsylvania-climate-change-greenhouse-gases-republican-legislature/"">fourth largest emitter</a> of greenhouse gas emissions in the nation, Pennsylvania has an obligation to do its part to combat the climate crisis. To that end, Pennsylvania is well on its way toward achieving a 2025 goal, laid out in Governor Wolf's <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/executive-order-2019-01-commonwealth-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change-and-promoting-energy-conservation-and-sustainable-governance/"">Executive Order 2019-01</a>, to reduce emissions 26 percent below 2005 levels. But moresignificant action will be necessary to achieve a long-term goal of reducing emissions by 80 percent by 2050.</p><p>As difficult as the 2050 target may seem, waiting until mid-century to slash emissions will bring even greater hardship. The fifth iteration in a series of reports outlining the commonwealth's progress in addressing climate change, the CAP highlights how Pennsylvania's average temperature has already risen nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900. We're now on course for another 6 degrees of warming by mid-century.</p><p>While progress has been made, it will be hard for Pennsylvania to meet its climate goals as long as the fracked gas and other fossil fuel industries continue receiving preferential treatment from our elected officials.</p><p>Earlier this year, the General Assembly continued to throw good money after bad in offering <a href=""/Blog-Item-A-New-Coalition-for-a-Better-Future"">massive handouts to incentivize</a> the construction of more petrochemical facilities here. That's not to mention the more than 50 other ways our state and local governments <a href=""/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">subsidize fracked gas and other fossil fuel industries</a> across the Commonwealth.</p><p>We cannot expect to meet these bold emissions reductions goals while still relying on dirty energy for economic growth. Unfortunately, Pennsylvania's electric power sector <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=PA"">heavily relies on fracked gas</a>. Now, Pennsylvanians need to accept the hard truth that we must transition -as soon as possible -fromfossil fuels, including fracked gas, as the way forward to achieve carbon neutrality. Bold action must be taken to avert the most disastrous consequences of the climate crisis. Continued support for the fracking industry undermines the governor's climate change ambitions.</p><p>While the power generation sector has to be an integral focus of emissions reductions, the Climate Action Plan highlighted a new sector that is set to overtake the electricity sector and soon become Pennsylvania's largest contributor of emissions: industry.</p><p>In 2005, the industrial sector released only half as many emissions as electricity generation. By 2030, industrial sources will be responsible for more emissions than all the state's power plants and agriculture - combined. This unfortunate trend is driven by a forecasted growth in petrochemical plants as well as continued pollution from steel plants, cement manufacturers, and other industrial producers. The CAP predicts industrial emissions to grow 14 percent by 2030.<br /><br /> Still, the governor's 2050 goals are not out of reach. Several of the clean energy policies recommended in the CAP are, in fact, well underway. Further policy changes could very reasonably put us on track to achieve the goal of reducing emissions by 80 percent.<br /><br /> Earlier this month, for instance, Pennsylvania's Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) <a href=""/Blog-Item-So-What-Comes-Next-for-Pennsylvania's-Efforts-to-Join-the-Regional-Greenhouse-Gas-Initiative"">voted to approve DEP's proposed CO2 Budget Trading Rule</a>. The development means Pennsylvania could become a participant in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), likely by early next year.<br /><br /> Joining RGGI would help to level the playing field for renewable energy producers. The CAP forecasts a modest growth of renewable energy production in the years ahead, leveling off at 10 percent. This sober estimate pales in comparison to the optimistic forecast produced this month by the U.S. Department of Energy. The <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-solar-futures-study-providing-blueprint-zero-carbon-grid"">Solar Future Study</a> laid out a vision for solar energy - all on its own - fulfilling 40 percent of the country's energy supplies.<br /><br /> The contrast is less about differences in report authors' energy policy philosophies, and more of a reflection of how Pennsylvania's renewable energy incentives are increasingly antiquated. After all, the state's <a href=""https://www.puc.pa.gov/filing-resources/issues-laws-regulations/aeps-act/"">Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard Act</a>was signed into law 17 years ago. Energy markets have since evolved, yet our energy policies remain relatively unchanged.</p><p>Finally, the transportation sector will also have to cut emissions significantly to reach the 2050 goal, accounting for 21 percent of targeted emission reductions.</p><p>Pennsylvania's transit agencies and other public and private fleet operators are increasingly switching to battery-electric vehicles, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/16/battery-electric-freight-train-wabtec-rail-transport-emissions"">like Pittsburgh-based Wabtec</a>, which recently unveiled the world's first battery-electric freight train. Growing prevalence of charging infrastructure and declining costs of electric vehicles will likely accelerate the transition. Plus, greater electrification further underscores the importance of switching to a cleaner electric grid.</p><p>CAP is further evidence that ambitious climate action is not only necessary for protecting Pennsylvania's environment but also beneficial for our economy. DEP suggests that implementing the 18 clean-energy policy changes outlined in the report would generate an average of 42,000 new jobs every year.</p><p>Lawmakers should take notice. Further delay on serious climate action not only risks further exacerbating heat waves, flooding, and other climate-induced threats. By delaying the transition to a clean energy economy, our state leaders are choosing to protect the fracked gas industry and hold back Pennsylvania's full economic potential.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jacquelyn Bonomo, PennFuture President and CEO"
Pennsylvania as a Hydrogen Hub,9/16/2021,"<p>It was recently announced that fossil fuel industry leader Perry Babb <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2021/08/15/A-laboratory-at-scale-a-hydrogen-carbon-storage-shale-drilling-and-urea-project-has-hit-the-industry-zeitgeist-at-just-the-right-time/stories/202108080048%E2%80%8B"">will launch a $410 million project</a> called KeyState to Zero in Clinton County, north-central Pennsylvania. This effort is part of a larger push by a mixture of government and private entities to pursue hydrogen as an alleged means to achieve net zero carbon emissions. Hydrogen, generally, is seen as an alternative to traditional fossil fuels <a href=""https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/hydrogen-101/"">for heavy industries that cannot be electrified</a> as easily, such as marine transportation, cement and steel production, and long-haul freight. Hydrogen by itself has no carbon and thus emits none when burned or reacted in fuel cells. However, Babb and others fail to make the explicit distinction between the different types of hydrogen power that exist. Not all hydrogen is created equal, and Babb's hydrogen plant merely keeps the fossil fuel industry alive while polluting just as much as, and in some cases more than, current dirty sources.</p><p>One form of hydrogen power which can be truly clean and net-zero is achieved through electrolysis. This form of hydrogen power, also known as ""green"" hydrogen, uses renewable energy to power the splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. However, PennFuture recognizes that <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/thebarkedition17"">even this form of hydrogen power</a> is still inefficient and costly in most cases, and we must invest resources, time, and research in other forms of sustainable energy such as solar and wind.</p><p>One of the other forms of hydrogen power involves the capturing and sequestering of carbon dioxide (CO2), commonly known as ""blue"" hydrogen. Blue hydrogen proponents see potential in Pennsylvania becoming a ""Blue Hydrogen Hub."" This is due to the vast amounts of natural gas located in the state, as methane (a large component of natural gas) releases massive amounts of CO2 which can be captured and stored into producing blue hydrogen. Proponents also believe that legacy fossil fuel pipelines can be retrofitted to transport blue hydrogen, which itself can also be blended with traditional fossil fuels and used as energy. This effectively allows the fossil fuel industry an extended lifeline-where it can continue to extract and pollute, while capturing some CO2 and producing hydrogen power.</p><p>Babb called blue hydrogen <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2021/08/15/A-laboratory-at-scale-a-hydrogen-carbon-storage-shale-drilling-and-urea-project-has-hit-the-industry-zeitgeist-at-just-the-right-time/stories/202108080048%E2%80%8B"">a stepping stone to green hydrogen</a> and net zero emissions, as it is too expensive to mass produce green hydrogen at this time. However, while hydrogen on its own produces no carbon emissions, the process required to create blue hydrogen itself is just as CO2-intensive as traditional methane-based natural gas production and even more potentially harmful to the environment. Hydrogen is a smaller molecule than natural gas and more easily leaks out of steel pipelines. It can also cause steel to become weak and brittle, and thus is easier to combust and can create a flame unseen by the human eye. And the truth remains that the more money and time spent on promoting blue hydrogen, the less focus there will be on developing cleaner, green hydrogen. Green hydrogen only comprises <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/green-hydrogen-is-gaining-traction-but-it-must-overcome-big-hurdles.html"">about .1 percent of all global hydrogen production</a>. It is clear that the fracked gas industry is not looking for a stepping stone, but for an endpoint with blue hydrogen.</p><p>On a nationwide lens, it was recently reported that President Biden's current bipartisan infrastructure legislation <a href=""https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/energy/567726-new-study-says-biden-approved-blue-hydrogen-may"">would allocate $8 billion of the total $1 trillion</a> to development and research on CO2 capture and storage-based energy, blue hydrogen. According to the Guardian, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/12/clean-fuel-blue-hydrogen-coal-study"">blue hydrogen creates 20 percent more greenhouse gases</a> than coal during its production. According to the Energy Science & Engineering journal, <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ese3.956"">blue hydrogen is 60 percent more polluting</a> than burning diesel when being burned for heat.</p><p>There are green hydrogen projects underway that are at least worth examining further. One is by New York-based <a href=""https://www.ir.plugpower.com/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2021/Plug-Power-and-Brookfield-Renewable-Move-Forward-with-Green-Hydrogen-Plant-in-South-Central-Pennsylvania/default.aspx"">company Plug Power</a>, who is partnering with Holtwood Dam operator Brookfield Renewable Partners to build Pennsylvania's first green hydrogen plant in southern Lancaster County. The new plant will use power from the hydroelectric facility and water from the Susquehanna River to produce 15 metric tons of liquid hydrogen per day, which the company says is enough to power 1,500 heavy-duty trucks. The plant is expected to be online by the end of 2022 and create 25 permanent jobs. As stated earlier, however, state and federal funds allocated to hydrogen should be invested in researching and developing cheaper and sustainable methods to utilize green hydrogen in the future.</p><p>For those well aware of the need for our nation to get serious about mitigating climate change, Pennsylvania becoming a ""Blue Hydrogen Hub"" would simply be continuing us down the same ruinous path. It has long been the position of PennFuture that we, as both a Commonwealth and a nation, must work towards zero carbon emissions through economic, research, and development investments into alternative, green energy sources which would also produce good paying jobs for our citizens.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy,"John Ukenye, Policy Analyst"
"PennFuture, Partners Appeal Air Permit Extension for Proposed Liquefied Natural Gas Plant in Wyalusing Township",9/15/2021,"<p>The Department of Environmental Protection (""DEP"") recently issued a second extension of the air pollution permit for a proposed Bradford County Real Estate Partners (""BCREP"") Liquified Natural Gas (""LNG"") facility near the Susquehanna River in Wyalusing Township, Bradford County, in Northeastern Pennsylvania.PennFuture, and our partners Clean Air Council and Sierra Club, appealed this extension to the Environmental Hearing Board.</p><p>The facility would process fracked natural gas into LNG for shipment by truck or train to a proposed LNG export facility in Gibbstown, New Jersey for transport overseas.The Wyalusing facility would include a six-million-gallon LNG storage tank and truck loadout system.If completed, the Wyalusing facility would be permitted to emit over a million tons of greenhouse gases and hundreds of tons of other harmful air pollutants annually.An LNG facility like this one would not only contribute to climate change and threaten public health and the environment through its direct emissions, but it would also lead to increased fracking in Pennsylvania and further entrenchment of the fossil fuel industry.</p><p>We object to the permit extension on a number of grounds.DEP erred in granting the extension because BCREP has not commenced construction at the Wyalusing facility, as required by the regulations.Further, the second extension relies on an outdated and flawed ""Best Available Technology"" determination.The DEP also relied on flawed analysis resulting in insufficient and erroneous air emission limits.We also object to the permit extension on the basis of a number of other significant deficiencies, as detailed in our Notice of Appeal.For more information, our full Notice of Appeal <a href=""/Files/Admin/2021-8-26-Notice-of-Appeal-without-exhibits.pdf"">may be read here.</a></p><p>Moreover, the Wyalusing facility is part of a logistically and financially connected LNG export scheme, which plans to truck or train highly explosive LNG through Pennsylvania communities, to be exported for overseas markets from the proposed facility in Gibbstown, NJ on the banks of the Delaware River.To learn more about LNG, its dangers, and the Wyalusing facility, please check out our LNG Blog Series: <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">LNG Blog #1</a>, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-2-Bomb-Trains-Through-Pennsylvania"">LNG Blog #2</a>, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-3-Protect-Northern-PA"">LNG Blog #3</a>, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-4-Liquified-Natural-Gas-Should-Not-Become-the-New-Bomb-Trains-to-Threaten-Our-Communities"">LNG Blog #4</a>, and <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-5-Public-opposition-grows-to-proposed-LNG-shipping-terminals"">LNG Blog #5</a>.</p><p>PennFuture has been engaged with local community members and organizations in tracking and opposing this facility and the transport of LNG across the state.PennFuture and Sierra Club <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Intervenes-to-Support-FERC-Jurisdiction-over-Wyalusing-LNG-Facility"">have previously objected</a> to a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") regarding FERC's jurisdiction over the proposed Wyalusing facility, thereby removing requirements to analyze the environmental impacts of the proposed scheme, including cumulative impacts under the National Environmental Policy Act.</p><p>Our appeal of this extension is another step in our efforts to ensure full oversight of the Wyalusing facility and the LNG industry in Pennsylvania.This LNG terminal is nothing more than one more dangerous speculation by a company trying to find new outlets for dirty fracked gas.And once again, our communities will suffer the harmful impacts of this scheme without any benefit of the end product.PennFuture stands committed to opposing new fracked gas facilities, instead supporting a true, sustainable clean energy future for Pennsylvania.</p><p>PennFuture works hard to protect our waters, our air, and our communities from the dangers of the petrochemical buildout across Pennsylvania.By challenging DEP's extension of the Wyalusing facility's air pollution permit, PennFuture continues that work and our fight for a clean energy future.If you are interested in supporting our fight, <a href=""/donate"">please become a member today!</a></p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Angela Kilbert, Staff Attorney"
So What Comes Next for Pennsylvania's Efforts to Join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative?,9/14/2021,"<p>On September 1st, 2021, a majority of Pennsylvania's Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) voted to approve the proposed CO2 Budget Trading Rule under which Pennsylvania will participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). IRRC not only found that finalizing the rule is in the public interest, they also concluded that the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) acted within its statutory authority and intent of the General Assembly when it approved the rule.</p><p>IRRC didn't take this step lightly. The boardnot only reviewed the text of the rule itself, but a massive 871-page packet that, in addition to the regulatory text at DEP's analysis of the regulation, included the DEP's responses to the 14,038 written comments they received and issues raised during 32 hours of testimony provided by 449 people during a series of public hearings this past December.In addition to that, IRRC received 280 comment submissions directly from the public along with 68 submissions from members of the legislature.Finally, IRRC took several hours of in-person testimony on the day of the hearing itself.</p><p>While this was a resounding vindication for the program, polluters and their friends in the legislature haven't given up their fight, and further delaying tactics are expected.</p><p>Shortly after IRRC's approval, the House Environmental Resources and Energy (ERE) Committee-led by the <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2021/08/05/Cleaner-air-must-be-the-goal-carbon-cap-and-trade-is-the-way-forward/stories/202107200018"">bombastic climate change denier Daryl Metcalfe</a>-quickly met to vote out a ""joint resolution of disapproval"" to kill the program.While there are enough anti-environmental votes in the House and Senate to pass such a resolution, it's unlikely that there are enough votes to override Governor Wolf's veto.</p><p>If this sounds familiar, it is.Last session the House and Senate passed HB 2025 which would have required any program to cut carbon pollution be submitted to the legislature for their approval. Governor Wolf quickly vetoed this bill and it didn't go any further-a good sign that the votes to override the veto just weren't there.</p><p>After already failing once, the Senate tried again this spring with a new version of the bill under the number SB 119.While this easily passed the Senate, it's been sitting inMetcalf's ERE committee without action since then. There is little doubt that this new bill would pass the House if it ever comes up for a vote, but that isn't good enough.Failing to pass with a veto-proof majority would be yet another loss for Metcalfeand his cronies.</p><p>While they may not be able to stop the rule, they can cause delays.With the resolution of disapproval voted out of committee, the House and Senate each have 30 calendar days or 10 session days (whichever is longer) to pass the resolution-which would stop the rule from going forward until at least mid-October.After the Governor vetoes the resolution, the House and Senate would get another 30 calendar days or 10 session days to override that veto.Depending on the precise timing, it could be December or January before that hurdle is cleared.</p><p>Once the clock expires without a veto override, the process isn't quite over yet.The Attorney General must review all regulatory packages for legality and form.This step isn't expected to be a problem, but a thorough review will take some additional time. And, once that is done, the package will go to the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) to arrange for it to be printed in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and officially go into effect. It typically takes several more weeks for the LRB to complete this process.</p><p>Actual implementation of the rule may be unlikely before the end of the year, but DEP foresaw that possibility. If not in effect by January 1, the rule will start at the beginning of the next calendar quarter following finalization.</p><p>Of course, those extra weeks of delay give polluters that much more time to dump their waste into our air for free.That may explain a lot about why their friends in the Legislature are fighting so hard.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
Climate Denial and Pennsylvania Politics: The Ultimate Alternative Universe,9/9/2021,"<p>Last week, on September 1, 2021, individuals on ""both sides"" of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) traveled to and from Harrisburg and through Hurricane Ida for an important meeting, that of the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, also known as IRRC.</p><p>On this day, IRRC was voting whether to advance a regulation that would have Pennsylvania join RGGI, so that the Commonwealth can pursue its climate pollution reduction goals.Be they on the pro-RGGI side of the 23-month long debate, or the anti-RGGI side, to a person, the witnesses mentioned their rough car ride and passages through the deluge that the tropical storm was dumping across our state.</p><p>As part of an organization whose mission it is to hasten the state's transition to clean energy, and for which Pennsylvania joining RGGI has been our top priority for reducing greenhouse gases here in the state, the journey to make it to this day had been rocky, but well-worth it because the commission ultimately voted in favor of Pennsylvania linking with RGGI, a big deal to be sure.</p><p>That day, many local and industry folks testified against RGGI, and that was to be expected.There were statements that perpetuated mistruths spread by industry about the program and the Governor's authority, which we dismiss without a second thought.There was angry testimony from folks who rejected everything about the program and its possibilities, who were never going to give RGGI a chance from the start.</p><p>And there was testimony that, for someone like me growing up in the anthracite coal mining region of northeastern Pennsylvania, experiencing the death of that industry and now living in the same region still struggling through economic and social upheaval decades after coal's demise...well, these testimonies hit a little closer to home.</p><p>Closer to home in that the world will be changing for communities still dependent on coal jobs as most energy produced by coal goes away.But this time around, RGGI will be providing a glidepath with funding to underwrite any number of investments that can make a difficult transition less hard.For communities that take advantage of this opportunity, the future can hold promise, and not be defined by a bitter political fight where regular folks are exploited by industry players who will eventually abandon them, and their children, to an inevitable end.</p><p>As the day went on, and people made their way home from the Harrisburg hearing, climate-supercharged storm Ida turned its horror on Pennsylvania and the Northeast, killing dozens of people and laughing in the face of our man-made environment.Homes, businesses, transmission lines, drainage and transportation systems that have been able to endure for generations, failing. Our infrastructure cannot withstand climate impacts, and our earth's protective natural systems have deteriorated and are collapsing into floods, fire, and worse.</p><p>In the face of a changed climate, where impacts are being felt in every part of our world, country and state, we have empathy for coal workers and their families.However, with climate action - the issue by which this era will be defined - and inaction of so many of our elected officials, we are holding accountable the anti-environmental politicians, the fossil fuel industry, and their lobby and public relations firms who in the face of an unleashed climate emergency:</p><ul><li>Put profit, pipelines, petrochemicals and plastics before Pennsylvanians;</li><li>Embrace climate denial and dismiss climate reality;</li><li>Abuse the power bestowed on them by the electorate who expect representation of the greater good, and instead represent special interests in breach;</li><li>Remain laser focused on policies and subsidies that serve coal, fracked gas and hydrogen, while neighboring states invest in climate saving renewable energy and efficiency;</li><li>and champion corporate entitlement before environmental rights.</li></ul><p>This is what defines the majority of our state legislature in the alternate universe of Pennsylvania.We need climate leadership here.We need to urgently decarbonize.Yes, there are abundant fossil fuels here, but it's time to leave them in the ground. We need to help our workers, and re-focus our unions. And we need voters to end this lunacy.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jacquelyn Bonomo, PennFuture President and CEO"
Philadelphia Has an Urban Planning Problem,8/25/2021,"<p>Philadelphia has an urban planning problem.</p><p>In the wake of <a href=""/Blog-Item-IPCC-Sounds-Code-Red-Alarm-on-Climate-Crisis"">the clarion call to action</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we can no longer delay in securing a city that is clean, green, and carbon neutral. Philadelphia public officials and residents must recognize that the insatiable hunger for more pavement and impervious surface will only further exacerbate the impact of climate change that is already being felt in neighborhoods across the city.</p><p>I was recently afforded the opportunity to publish <a href=""https://twitter.com/amnagel1/status/1427277271132409861/photo/1"">a letter in The Philadelphia Inquirer</a> on the importance of prioritizing green space and green infrastructure in civic space related <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/real-estate/inga-saffron/south-street-district-headhouse-plaza-design-philadelphia-20210811.html"">to Inga Saffron's column</a> on the new Headhouse Plaza. Many have written about the obvious flaws in the design and construction of the new plaza. The space does not provide any protection from the sun or rain. It is visually unappealing and offers no physical comfort to anyone who may need it. Headhouse Plaza lacks basic amenities and offers little in the way of the forward-thinking approach necessary to urban planning as we continue to deal with a changing climate. What it lacks in vision, it is clear that the space is exactly what some neighbors lobbied for throughout the design process.</p><p>The architect on the project <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/kywnewsradio/news/local/new-headhouse-plaza-brings-diverging-opinions"">said this</a>: ""It started out with some more greenery, but that was sort of scaled back because of some of the near neighbors. They had concerns about greenery. <em>People didn't want a place where all the dogs were going to go.""</em> (emphasis added)</p><p>One neighbor neatly summed up the major issue: ""We love it, it's a great improvement. The parking is nice. <em>We were afraid they were going to take away the parking.""</em> (emphasis added)</p><p>Previously, the square contained 40 parking spaces. The new design cut the number of spaces to 30. Reducing parking was a hot topic of conversation throughout the design and construction of the new plaza. When the Art Commission <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/art-commission-approves-public-space-expansion-at-headhouse-square/"">ultimately approved the design</a>, commissioners ""...wondered if such an act would provoke controversy, as parking is the third rail of both Philadelphia city politics and urban design.""</p><p>Philadelphia made significant strides <a href=""http://www.amlegal.com/pdffiles/Philadelphia/120431.pdf"">to reduce parking minimums in 2012</a>. Despite this and the efforts of other cities across the country to eliminate parking minimums entirely, we have seen attempts to reverse the progress made in Philadelphia <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/proposal-to-increase-parking-minimums-finds-no-support-from-planning-commission/"">time</a> and <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/city-council-moves-to-require-more-parking-in-philly-neighborhoods/"">time</a> again. Most recently, the Philadelphia City Planning Commission <a href=""https://www.phila2035.org/germantownnorth?fbclid=IwAR3GMLhQLwS6KioeuljtZ9lWL0N4KvVVsNNzwub65QLoHrKr2xf6jJAtiUM"">announced efforts to update zoning rules</a> in northern Germantown that would effectively mandate increased parking minimums in that area by requiring that new buildings with ten or more apartments or condos have a parking lot or garage. The city has framed this effort as part of its Philadelphia2035 comprehensive plan to manage growth and development in Philadelphia, but significantly increasing pavement and impervious surface does nothing to address the climate emergency we face in 2021 let alone the increasing heat and precipitation we must be prepared for in 2035.</p><p>More pavement and impervious surface will only make Philadelphia more vulnerable to warmer, wetter weather. There is <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/racism-left-hunting-park-overheated-neighbors-are-making-a-cooler-future/"">growing evidence and understanding</a> that urban spaces <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/a-coloring-book-to-inspire-solutions-for-cooling-phillys-hotter-neighborhoods/"">consistently suffer from more extreme temperatures</a> due to an absence of green space. We also know that <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/philadelphia-trees-canopy-urban-heat-island-race-20210811.html"">racist practices like redlining</a> have disproportionately impacted communities of color as they grapple with hotter temperatures than predominantly white neighborhoods. Impervious surface also directly leads to increased polluted runoff in our water and increased flooding in our streets due to <a href=""/Blog-Item-Its-Time-to-Reimagine-Americas-Infrastructure"">aging infrastructure that cannot properly handle a 21st century climate.</a></p><p>There is such a strong temptation to continue feeding the need for parking because of the powerful forces behind the parking industry and the vocal community members who do not want green space because it attracts too many dogs. Philadelphia may have been a parking diet since 2012, but it is time to quit the feeding frenzy for good. We must <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/real-estate/parking-laws-spaces-philadelphia-20210706.html"">rethink community spaces</a> and engage in processes that inform and educate about the imminent danger of climate change and the need to build more nature into our built world.</p><p>There are neighborhoods across Philadelphia that are suffering from urban heat island effect, and some people live in constant fear that their homes will flood every time it rains. Investments in green space and green infrastructure will help neighborhoods combat these dual threats.</p><p>Eastwick is one area <a href=""https://www.phillytrib.com/news/local_news/how-can-i-pay-for-this-eastwick-residents-struggle-to-fix-isaias-damage-without-federal/article_d1e4a326-9094-5bb9-b137-532e7ff7b608.html"">that needs help now to protect itself</a> from increased flooding and build a neighborhood that is more resilient to the effects of climate change. Neighbors are actively engaged and have been fighting for decades for investment in their community to address <a href=""https://nextcity.org/features/view/philadelphia-eastwick-neighborhood-urban-renewal-failure"">a legacy of broken promises and deliberate disinvestment.</a> Urban planning and development could serve as a model for the entire city with the proper approach and understanding of climate challenges to come.</p><p>Luckily, <a href=""https://issuu.com/interfacestudio/docs/lepls_final_031319"">there is already a plan</a> that broadly outlines what could be possible on city-owned land in Eastwick. While Philadelphia City Councilmember Kenyatta Johnson has taken the prudent approach to halt city development in the area, the Lower Eastwick Public Land Strategy does contain promising suggestions for additional green space and green infrastructure that should be the primary focus of any development in Eastwick.</p><p>PennFuture <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/councilmember-calls-for-500-million-for-to-resolve-eastwick-flooding/"">strongly supports Councilmember Johnson's call</a> for $500 million in federal infrastructure funding to be allocated to Philadelphia for flood mitigation efforts in Eastwick. This funding would help clear the way for natural solutions to the area's climate problems. Though there are certain aspects of the Lower Eastwick Public Land Strategy that <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/philadelphia-refinery-hilco-redevelopment-plan-soil-contamination-20200723.html"">should be discarded</a> due to other development projects in the area and their negative impact on climate readiness, the strategy points to multiple parcels that will provide open space, preserve existing wetlands, and implement green infrastructure to combat flooding.</p><p>Humanity has directly confronted nature with a built world for the past century - often at the expense of its most vulnerable communities. Now, we are faced with natural problems that will not be solved by <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/u-s-army-corps-and-city-water-department-say-study-on-eastwick-flooding-solutions-should-be-complete-in-october/"">levees</a>, <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/what-it-would-take-build-earthen-berm-flood-control-section-cobbs-creek-eastwick/"">earthen berms</a>, or more pavement.

It will require public officials to engage with residents, educate their constituents on the climate challenges we face, and be willing to ignore concerns about reduced parking and dogs that like trees and grass.

Civilian Conservation Corps: Then and Now,8/23/2021,"<p>Earlier this month, Promised Land State Park celebrated its annual Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Day in which the public was invited to the Masker Museum filled with live music, cake, CCC artifacts, and an honorary guest speaker, Cornelius McHugh, a former CCC worker who had just recently turned 100.</p><p>We learned that the Civilian Conservation Corps played a critical role healing our environment and putting Americans back to work. It was established in 1933 amidst the Dust Bowl wherein forests had been clear cut and burned, resulting in erosion and sedimentation of local streams and waterways as well as the Great Depression, in which 13 million people were suddenly unemployed due to an unregulated stock market crash.</p><p>This unique federal program established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt put 3 million single men between the ages of 18-25 to work, remedying the damage done by the poor land practices of the earlier centuries. While enrolled, some learned to read, many obtained their high school diploma and all learned a trade. Purposeful work restored a sense of values, taught essential skills and developed a work ethic among these recruits.The CCC boys fought fires, planted trees, built trails, campgrounds and roads, and helped create the beautiful Promised Land State Park in the Poconos area that so many visit today.</p><p>The CCC provided opportunities during a time without any social programs in place. Cornelius had mentioned he started his work for the CCC just five days after graduating high school. He had earned $30 a month, in which he had sent $25 back home to his family and kept $5 for himself--which he stated was efficient, especially because there were no other opportunities. In addition, the $5 he spent on cigarettes, candy, beer, and dates with local girls helped contribute to the local economy.</p><p>Many of the CCC boys went on to fight in WWII, and when they returned, they came home to a country that was prosperous and had conserved its natural treasures and a nationwide system of parks accessible to everyone.</p><p>The Civilian Conservation Corps had been a proven success, building 800 state parks in eight years, while keeping local businesses going and families fed. The success of the CCC in rebuilding our nation has taught us that we do not turn our backs on our fellow Americans in need and that we conserve our lands and waters for future generations.</p><p>And it's time to bring it back, but with a modernized spin to it.</p><p>As communities in Pennsylvania and across the country continue to face devastating economic conditions as well as the effects of the climate crisis, a revitalized Civilian Conservation Corps would enable us to invest in our workforce, our environment, and the next generation of conservationists.</p><p>Earlier this year, Senator Bob Casey proposed a new bill, S.B. 2414, for a revitalized CCC that will create federal conservation jobs, support agricultural conservation and ensure we are prioritizing environmental justice communities.</p><p>This bill comes after months of close collaboration with regional advocates like PennFuture and the ReImagine Appalachia coalition, to ensure that this legislation will help communities most impacted by the combined impacts of the downturn of the fossil fuel industry, the pandemic, and an ongoing opioid epidemic that has devastated families.</p><p>This CCC proposal prioritizes Black and Indigenous people, working people with low incomes, rural workers and returning citizens. Seventy million Americans-one in three adults-have a criminal record. By prioritizing these marginalized groups, a revitalized CCC could reverse the consequences of mass incarceration, by lifting barriers to the formerly incarcerated, those battling with opioid addiction, and their families.</p><p>Not only does this CCC proposal have a strong restorative justice component, but it will assist with carbon absorption by restoring wetlands, planting millions of diverse, native plants and trees, and removing invasive trees and shrubs. A new CCC can help farmers implement regenerative practices to restore the land by the new extractive industry practices over the last decades, potentially absorbing over 20% of all carbon emissions from the Appalachian region alone.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://reimagineappalachia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ReImagine-Appalachia_PeriBrief_PA_Jan2021.pdf"">a recent study from the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI)</a> and ReImagine Appalachia, relaunching the CCC could create 57,000 jobs in Pennsylvania. How could we pass that up?</p><p>This modernized Civilian Conservation Corps combines sound environmental policy with family-sustaining jobs and training. Similar to the lesson learned from the original CCC, we do not turn our backs on fellow Americans in need and must work to conserve our lands and water for future generations to come.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Annie Regan, Senior Program Manager"
IPCC Sounds ‘Code Red’ Alarm on Climate Crisis,8/13/2021,"<p>The days of climate change uncertainty are behind us. In the latest set of reports from the world's leading climate researchers, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/"">announced that the scientific evidence</a> of human influence on widespread and rapid warming is now ""unequivocal.""</p><p>All that remains uncertain is how much of the damage is irreversible, and whether we can muster the collective political courage to slow climate change before it's too late. Failure to reduce emissions will create, in the words of one climate researcher, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/10/code-red-for-humanity-what-the-papers-say-about-the-ipcc-report-on-the-climate-crisis"">""hell on earth.""</a><br /><br /> Climate policies such as <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fallacy-Fiction-and-Falsehoods-Debunking-RGGI-Myths-Part-1"">the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a> are crucially important because we still have a window of opportunity to slow the pace of warming. Failure to reduce emissions in the next few years will force upon future generations an environment that is veryhot, wet and dangerous, barely resembling the world as we know it today.</p><p>The ""Physical Science Basis"" is the first release in a series of landmark summary findings to be rolled out in the next year. To develop the international body's Sixth Assessment Report, hundreds of climate researchers reviewed all the relevant scientific literature published since 2013.<br /><br /> The IPCC assessment reached the following conclusions:</p><ul><li>Humans are responsible for warming global surface temperatures by an estimated average of 1.07 degrees Celsius (1.9 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.</li><li>Global climate change is due to a buildup of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, now reaching annual averages of 410 parts per million (ppm) for carbon dioxide (CO2), 1,866 parts per billion (ppb) for methane (CH4), and 332 ppb for nitrous oxide (N2O).</li><li>Concentrations of atmospheric pollution have reached historic highs. CO2 levels are higher than at any time in at least 2 million years, while methane and N2O are higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.</li><li>As a result, each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it, dating back to temperatures recorded in 1850.</li><li>Climate change is very likely compounding our risks of extreme events such as heatwaves, droughts, fire, and heavy floods, as well as intensifying global trends of sea level rise, ocean acidification, and glacial retreat.</li></ul><p>Although the severity of climate change will be experienced unevenly around the world, no region will be totally unaffected. In the eastern half of North America, the assessment <a href=""/Blog-Item-Updated-Climate-Change-Assessment-Reveals-Future-Pennsylvania-Water-Troubles"">concludes that significant increases in heavy precipitation</a> and flooding are both very likely, especially if current levels of emissions continue.<br /><br /> Essentially, the clock is ticking. We can release less than 500 additional gigatons of carbon dioxide - roughly equal to 10 years of current global emissions - if we want a decent chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). So far, we're on pace to pass the 1.5-degree mark by the early 2030s.<br /><br /> In Pennsylvania, joining RGGI would cost-effectively mandate limits on carbon emissions by allowing electricity generation producers to cooperate with counterparts across the Northeast. To put RGGI into motion, the CO2 Budget Trading Program has been proposed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). But the program is still awaiting Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) approval, <a href=""/Blog-Item-What-Comes-Next-in-Pennsylvanias-Efforts-to-Join-RGG"">the current step in a 19-month (and counting) regulatory process.</a></p><p>While progress on joining RGGI is a welcomed development, the latest IPCC report makes clear that delay comes with serious consequences. Regulatory hurdles help polluting industries continue to profit while devastating climate change awaits.<br /><br /> On the federal level, <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684"">the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to combat climate change. The current version of the recently passed Senate bill would, if passed by the House of Representatives, upgrade our power infrastructure to better accommodate renewable energy, develop a national network of electric vehicle chargers, and support school districts with buying electric buses and building out the necessary charging infrastructure.<br /><br /> Still, more is needed. The FY 2022 <a href=""https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/MEMORANDUM%20for%20Democratic%20Senators%20-%20FY2022%20Budget%20Resolution.pdf"">Budget Resolution Agreement</a> being discussed in Congress has included proposals for a Clean Electricity Payment Program. If passed through reconciliation, the legislation would incentivize electric utilities to transition to 80-percent clean energy by 2030.<br /><br /> This kind of bold leadership is needed at every level of government and throughout the private sector. By now, each and every municipality, school district, business, and property owner in Pennsylvania needs to wake up to the realities of our climate crisis. Rather than wait and deal with the consequences, it is time to embrace readily available energy efficiency, clean electricity and low-carbon transportation options.<br /><br /> Transitioning to a clean energy future is necessary if we want to avert the worst outcomes of a warming climate. We simply do not have time to waste.</p>",Climate; Community; Environment,"Jared Stonesifer, Director of Media Relations"
Chasing Bitcoin is a Bad Investment for Pennsylvania,8/12/2021,"<p>On August 9th, 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#SPM"">released its Sixth Assessment report</a>, clearly linking human-caused climate change to the extreme heatwaves and severe weather events we see all around the world.While it's not too late to avoid the most severe effects, the situation is projected to get even worse without immediate action to cut carbon pollution.</p><p>Against that backdrop, it is shocking that our state government is continuing to force Pennsylvanians to not only suffer the consequences of climate change but to pay polluters massive subsidies that will result in even more emissions. Invariably these unsustainable businesses are boom-and-bust.They take the higher profits while they can, before leaving PA taxpayers to pay to clean up their mess.</p><p>PennFuture has written extensively on how this subsidy-then-bust process is propping up fracking and petrochemical businesses in Pennsylvania. This pattern can also be found in the incredibly dirty waste coal industry, but now with an unlikely partner-Bitcoin. One recent example is Stronghold Digital Mining-a new firm that repurposes dirty waste-coal burning power plants to mine the cryptocurrency known as bitcoin.</p><p>In late July 2021, <a href=""https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-038087/#BUSINESS"">Stronghold filed a form S-1</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing information about the business and its finances.They report that they currently own and operate the Scrubgrass waste coal plant in Venango County, have a definitive agreement for the Panther Creek plant in Carbon County, and a letter of intent to purchase a third plant-all for the purpose of bitcoin mining. Unlike the fracking and petrochemical industry, Stronghold is at least open about the fact that their business model requires significant taxpayer subsidies for it to be viable.</p><p><u>Bitcoin is an energy intensive process and a growing carbon polluter</u></p><p>The Bitcoin Network as a whole consumes a tremendous amount of energy to run millions of special-purpose computers-known as application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs-that attempt to ""mine"" new blocks in the bitcoin blockchain. To create a new block these computers race to find a special number that, combined with the financial transactions and other data recorded in the block, gives a result that meets specific criteria.This is a trial-and-error process that is akin to picking the winning lottery number, but much more difficult, often taking trillions of attempts to find a working number.At the time of this writing, finding the special number might earn the winning miner nearly $300,000 worth of bitcoins. But, if someone else finds the number first, losingminers get nothing and must start the process from scratch.To be competitive, miners build vast data centers containing potentially thousands of ASIC miners, each testing many trillion of these hashes every second.</p><p>According to data from the <a href=""https://cbeci.org/"">Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index</a>, the network currently takes over 9 gigawatts (GW) of power to operate and could be as high as 35GW. Even at the low end of that range, that is enough electricity for over seven million houses. Stronghold, for its part, reports that they currently operate 1,840 miners that can cumulatively test around 85 thousand-trillion hashes per second (85 PH/S) and draw about 4.1 Megawatts (MW) of power-enough to supply over 3,000 average houses.</p><p>Bottom line: it takes an obscene amount of energy to mine bitcoin and now companies are looking to power that mining by buying up cheap, dirty, outdated power plants just to run the computers to do the mining. In the case of Stronghold, this power is coming from the Scrubgrass waste-coal power plant and, based on their 2019 emissions data, the existing mining is likely resulting in over 6 tons of CO2 being emitted every hour.That's more than 6,700 vehicle-miles worth of pollution.</p><p>That is bad enough, but Stronghold reports it has a definitive agreement to buy the Panther Creek waste-coal plant and has signed a letter of intent to purchase a third plant.In all, they are forecasting acquiring 57,000 miners by the end of 2022 and consuming 193 MW of electricity.The exact pollution rate depends on how these miners are split among the three plants, but it may be in the range of 278 tons per hour of CO2.Also, because this is new demand on the grid, other generators may end up increasing their output-and their pollution-to meet the demand that these plants will no longer serve.That could easily add another 25 tons of CO2 per hour-more than 30,000 vehicle-miles worth of emissions-and possibly much higher .</p><p><u>Stronghold Digital Mining's business model is an environmental nightmare</u></p><p>Stronghold is selling its business model to investors as environmental progress-it's purchasing waste coal plants to power its cryptocurrency mining while removing culm piles that scar Pennsylvania's landscapes and communities. Unfortunately, this is a classic case of greenwashing.</p><p>Coal-fired power plants are all notoriously dirty, but waste coal facilities are even worse.In addition to CO2, the Scrubgrass plant's most recent emissions report shows hundreds of tons of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrochloric acid, carbon monoxide, and more than a dozen other air pollutants including neurotoxins, carcinogens, and smog-forming compounds.</p><p>In addition, the Trump administration <a href=""/Blog-Item-Trump-Administration-Rolls-Back-Air-Protections-from-Fossil-Fuel-Plants"">rolled back critical air quality protections for waste-coal plants</a> (although PennFuture and others have challenged this).While Stronghold claims that their operation is ""environmentally beneficial"" because it burns waste coal from piles that are currently polluting the land, they barely mention the very real public health and financial damages caused by increased air pollution and don't consider any alternatives to digging them up and burning them.Even if one believes that some waste piles are so dangerous that the damage and pollution from burning them could be justified, there is no guarantee these are the ones that will be used.</p><p>Waste coal is always dirty, but the bitcoin industry has an additional waste stream we should be concerned about-tons of electronics waste from thousands of obsolete ASICs.Because of the competitive nature of Bitcoin mining, the hardware has a very limited useful life-in some cases as short as 18 months-before new hardware renders it obsolete. We see this in Stronghold's own filing with many of their miners requiring 1,300 watts to calculate 13 trillion hashes per second (TH/s) where newer devices work three times as fast for the same power.As highly optimized ""application specific"" devices, there is little chance that any obsolete devices will be reused.</p><p><u>Pennsylvanians are, once again, being forced to subsidize pollution without any say</u></p><p>Another obvious problem with burning waste coal is the expense.The reason why coal plants are closing across the country is because they can't compete with cheaper gas-fired power plants and even cheaper clean renewable energy.A recent study on <a href=""https://www.lazard.com/perspective/lcoe2020"">the levelized cost of energy</a> (LCOE) shows coal costing more than $65 per megawatt-hour (MWh).Gas might be as low as $44/MWh and renewable energy can be as low as $26/MWh.Compared to a traditional coal plant like Homer City-which itself has faced bankruptcy-Scrubgrass needs to burn more than three times as much fuel for the same generation.Even with low-quality fuel that costs roughly half as much, it's clear that waste coal is never going to be the cheapest source of energy.</p><p>Stronghold claims that fuel costs, operational and maintenance costs, and administrative expenses to operate Scrubgrass will result in power costing $43/MWh.That seems very optimistic since the company reported $17,629,051 in total 2019 operating expenses in the S-1 filing and 239,191 MWh of generation reported to the Energy Information Administration.Thatsuggests actual costs over $73/MWh. The S-1 lists income from energy sales for the period of just over $29/MWh, which is slightly higher than the PJM grid average of $25/MWh, but it also shows a $6 million operating loss on $7 million in energy sales, so real costs operating the facilities are likely much higher than their sales suggest.</p><p>Even if the company can bring the operating costs down to 43/MWh, it's still a big leap to go to the $18/MWh Stronghold claims they expect to pay for power going forward.To get to that number requires significant state subsidies.</p><p><em>Subsidy #1: PJM Capacity Over-procurement</em></p><p>First, Stronghold expects to receive $6/MWh from the PJM capacity market.This is a separate payment, in addition to the purchase of energy, that our electric grid operator makes to ensure sufficient generation capacity will be available in the future. Companies get these payments if they bid low enough to clear the capacity auction and are available to be dispatched in the delivery year.Over-procurement of capacity has historically acted as a subsidy for fossil fuels, but for 2022/23 <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/tom-rutigliano/how-save-four-billion-without-really-trying"">PJM procured much less capacity</a> resulting in a market clearing price of $50/MW-day, or about $1.7 million dollars a year for a plant like Scrubgrass.With payments that low, the only way they will receive $6.00/MWh is if the facility only ran at 35% capacity.There would be no reason to purchase two additional waste coal plants if Scrubgrass had that much spare capacity, so the company must be counting on capacity prices in the future well over $100/MW-day.That may have been common in the past, but there is no guarantee payments will return to that level. If true though, this implies billions of dollars in additional payments will come from the pockets of ratepayers.</p><p><em>Subsidy #2: Tier II Alternative Energy Credits</em></p><p>While most states have ""Renewable"" portfolio standards, Pennsylvania has an Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) program that subsidizes polluting resources like waste coal under what is called Tier II.In 2019, Tier II credits were not particularly valuable averaging only $0.31/MWh of generation statewide. Scrubgrass did better than average reporting $105,532 from this source or $0.41/MWh, but going forward, their prospectus estimates a huge jump to $15/MWh for these credits.</p><p>In 2020, our legislature changed the rules to the AEPS program restricting where Tier II credits could be generated.Instead of coming from a qualifying facility anywhere in the PJM grid-an area covering all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia, those credits will largely need to be generated within Pennsylvania.Prices are expected to spike as a result and, in fact, 2020 credits already shot up to $1.92 before this change was finalized costing ratepayers over $21 million.</p><p>We don't have a clear indication how high these prices will actually go, but this doesn't appear to have been a significant concern for the Legislature, and it certainly didn't stop them. If prices actually go up to $15 per credit, it would cost Pennsylvania ratepayers an additional $168 million. That is not only far more that we pay for cleaner wind and solar credits, it is more than the entire AEPS program cost in 2020.</p><p><em>Subsidy #3: Coal Refuse Reclamation tax credit</em></p><p>The next handout Pennsylvanian's are providing these plants comes in the form of the Coal Refuse Reclamation (CRR) tax credit.This is a transferable credit of $4 for each ton of waste coal these facilities burn. Perversely, this means a plant burning dirtier and lower quality fuel gets a bigger handout per megawatt hour. While the original tax credit was capped at $10 million, our legislature again dug into the pockets of ratepayers in late 2020 doubling the cap to $20 million.</p><p>While currently the $4/MWh Stronghold expects to receive from this subsidy is reasonable for a facility like Scrubgrass, the $20 million cap may already be fully utilized.That means that if the company expands to three facilities and runs at higher capacity like they claim, there will be proportionally fewer credits available per megawatt hour in the future.That makes their claims in the prospectus suspect, but there has already been talk in our legislature about raising the cap on this handout yet again-that would mean higher profits for these polluters.</p><p><em>Subsidy #4: RGGI Allowance Set-asides</em></p><p>At the same time we are giving significant handouts to buy more pollution, Governor Wolf has directed the Department of Environmental protection to move forward with programs to begin to address the climate crisis.One of these is the CO2 Budget Trading Rule through which Pennsylvania will participate with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).This program sets a cap for allowable carbon pollution from electric generation and requires that facilities purchase an allowance for each ton of CO2 they emit.</p><p>Facing significant pressure from the legislature, this program included-and then expanded-yet another handout for waste coal generation.The program sets aside 12.8 million allowances that, if needed, will be given to waste coal generation for free.As a result, waste coal facilities can nearly double their 2019 generation and dump all the resulting pollution in the air without paying the fees other polluters must pay.Of course, the citizens of Pennsylvania will still pay the price for increased pollution and we will all suffer the worsening effects of climate change if we don't focus on cutting harmful emissions.</p><p><u>Chasing bitcoin is a bad investment for Pennsylvania</u></p><p>After totaling up all the subsidies, Stronghold claims it will only be paying $18 per megawatt-hour of electricity-or $11/MWh less than average on our power grid.That is an amazingly low rate, if true, but it's far from a sure thing.Their projections are based on about $16 in direct handouts for each ton of waste coal they burn, plus free carbon allowances that may be worth in the neighborhood of $8 per ton.</p><p>Even if the company receives all of those handouts, it still may not be able to operate as cheaply as they claim.In addition to these highly optimistic predictions, they are relying on indirect subsidies in the form of weak regulation-specifically that the EPA will not correct the abuses of the Trump administration, which weakened the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, among other rules.</p><p>Those cheap operating costs also have a big price.They neglect the very real costs of public health and environmental damage caused by the excess air pollution-particularly in the vulnerable communities near these plants.The negative externalities these plants cause but don't pay for, when reduced to dollar values, the citizens of Pennsylvania paying for all these damages could end up being the single largest subsidy the facility receives.</p><p>Even if we pay the high prices and accept all the harms, this isn't a sustainable long-term business model.By design, the number of bitcoins one receives for mining a new block decreases over time and, if the value of each coin rises, the competition only gets more intense.This creates a highly-competitive industry with miners flocking to wherever electricity is cheap.Even if sites like Scrubgrass make sense today, things can change quickly if we don't keep ramping up the handouts.</p><p>There is a better way.According to <a href=""https://arippa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ARIPPA-Report-FINAL-June-2019.pd"">the waste coal industry's own numbers</a>, proper disposal of the waste piles would only cost $33 per ton and other options, such as stabilizing the piles by planting beach grass, could be far cheaper.Instead of forcing Pennsylvanians to hand over their hard-earned money to an industry that turns one form of pollution into another, we should be putting people to work actually solving the problem of coal waste.</p><p>If Stronghold wants to truly be a sustainable and environmentally beneficial company, it should ditch dirty coal and source its energy from cheaper, scalable, and rapidly growing renewable energy.If not, it's no better than the other major polluters in Pennsylvania or the failed coal companies that left these mountains of waste coal behind in the first place.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
"PennFuture, Partners Challenge DEP's Approval of Renovo Energy Center",8/10/2021,"<p>If we are truly committed to moving to a renewable energy economy, rather than a fossil-fuel based economy, the first step is to stop building new fossil fuel infrastructure.</p><p>Unfortunately, Pennsylvania is struggling with that first step. The Department of Environmental Protection recently approved the application for the construction of the <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/About/Regional/North-central-Regional-Office/Community-Information/Pages/Renovo-Energy-Center-.aspx"">Renovo Energy Center</a>, a proposed 1240-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Clinton County PA. If completed, this facility will be one of ten largest emitters of carbon pollution fossil-fuel power plants in Pennsylvania and could emit more than two million tons of carbon pollution every year. Any new polluting industry in PA poses a threat, but with the ever-worsening climate crisis the time for completing a clean energy transition is running out.</p><p>As a result, PennFuture and our partners, Clean Air Council and the Center for Biological Diversity, <a href=""https://ehb.courtapps.com/efile/documentViewer.php?documentID=52766"">are challenging the DEP's issuance of this approval</a> to the Renovo Energy Center. We believe that some of DEP's own policies were violated in approving this plant. Among other issues, we contend that DEP failed to follow its own Environmental Justice Participation Policy and misapplied analyses regarding best available control technology (BACT) as well as required cost-benefit analyses. We also allege that DEP violated Article I, Section 27, of the PA Constitution, also known as the Environmental Rights Amendment.</p><p>First, we contend in our challenge that DEP failed to properly take into account that this plant is slated to be in an environmental justice (EJ). These communities, <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/OfficeofEnvironmentalJustice/Pages/PA-Environmental-Justice-Areas.aspx"">defined in Pennsylvania</a> as ""any census tract where 20 percent or more individuals live at or below the federal poverty line, and/or 30 percent or more of the population identifies as a non-white minority,"" have long been subjected to environmental racism. Industrial facilities are usually built among poor or minority communities, leaving them at higher risk of water and air pollution from the facilities.</p><p>Furthermore, across the globe, these communities are often the ones being hid the hardest by the climate crisis. The Renovo plant not only will create industrial pollution in this community but will also further contribute to climate change, which is already harming vulnerable populations the most. The Department's own <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=7918&DocName=ENVIRONMENTAL%20JUSTICE%20PUBLIC%20PARTICIPATION%20POLICY.PDF%20"">environmental justice public participation policy</a> was implemented to increase engagement in these communities and ensure they have a say in the developments that occur in their neighborhoods. This policy includes meetings with local community stakeholders, distribution of information about proposed projects in a manner accessible to members of the local community, and formal and informal public meetings where community members can seek answers and voice their concerns. Unfortunately, these steps do not seem to have been taken here, and the DEP has authorized the Renovo plant to be built without following its own policy to consult with the local community.</p><p>Second, we contend that DEP did not properly conduct the required BACT analysis to determine the ""best available control technology."" The analysis requires proposals to consider whether there are any other options that are cleaner and more efficient that will adequately meet the needs of the facility. However, for this facility, the only analysis that was conducted was to compare turbines from three different manufacturers and choose the one with the lowest overall emissions. However, this approach lumps together different categories of emissions, and emissions of different chemicals are not all the same. We contend that this was against the requirements of BACT.</p><p>Third, cost benefit analyses are an important step in the permitting process and have long been required under state and federal law. However, in the permitting for the Renovo plant, these analyses failed to consider the public harms of plant. One prime example is the social cost of carbon and other greenhouse gases. The ""social cost"" is a way of estimating the harm that something will do and the eventual expense of remediating it. The Biden administration <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cost-of-carbon-pollution-pegged-at-51-a-ton/"">has set the social cost of carbon at $51 a ton</a>, methane at $1500 a ton and nitrous oxide at $18000 a ton. Numbers such as these must be considered when estimating the ""costs"" of the plant in order to have an accurate cost benefit analysis, yet this part of the process was sorely lacking.</p><p>Lastly, we assert that the construction of this new plant is a violation of Pennsylvania citizens' rights under Article I, Section 27 of the state constitution, <a href=""https://blogs.law.widener.edu/envirolawcenter/files/2010/03/PA_Citizens_Guide_to_Art_I_Sect_27.pdf"">known as the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA)</a>. Under the ERA, ""The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvanias public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people."" This means that only do Pennsylvania citizens have a guaranteed right to clean air, but so do the future residents and citizens of Pennsylvania who have not even been born yet. Air pollution from this plant and the ever-present threat of climate change poses a serious threat of these guaranteed rights. As an agent of the commonwealth, DEP has a responsibility to protect and maintain these rights, not permit them to be trampled by industrial pollution.</p><p>This proposed plant is important because not only will it contribute pollution directly into the environment of Renovo and Clinton County, but it also perpetuates use of fracked gas and the corresponding carbon emissions.</p><p>Pennsylvania, in fact, <a href=""https://www.puc.pa.gov/General/publications_reports/pdf/EPO_2019.pdf"">already exports a quarter of the power generated here</a>, so any energy generated by this facility will not benefit the people of the Commonwealth who will be most harmed by the project. Pennsylvania could be a leader of the green energy economy and move away from dirty gas plants such as this. It is critical we do not waste that chance by continuing to support dangerous fracked gas plants. By challenging DEP's approval of the Renovo Energy Center, PennFuture continues the fight for a greener, cleaner environment for all.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Daniela Rakhlina-Powsner, Legal Intern"

"Stakeholders Making Progress on Chesapeake Bay Goals, but Legislature Still Lagging",8/2/2021,"<p>On July 28th, <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/Pennsylvania%E2%80%99s%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Program%20Office/WIP3/Pages/Public-Meetings.aspx"">the Chesapeake Bay State Team</a>, led by the Secretaries of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), and the Department of Agriculture (PDA), met to hear updates on the progress on the implementation of the Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) and what's coming next.</p><p>In short, a lot of work is being done by the DEP and other state agencies, as well as the County Action Teams, to get Pennsylvania on track to meet its goals set by the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). After years of lackluster planning and implementation, Pennsylvania and the other Bay states should celebrate the huge strides that are underway over the last two years since the completion of the Phase 3 WIP.</p><p>However, there is one critical area with few successes to report: the legislature's progress to provide adequate funding to meet our clean water goals.</p><p><u>Areas of Progress</u></p><ul><li>Countywide Action Plans</li></ul><p>The Phase 3 WIP breaks up watershed restoration into county planning and implementation efforts, <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/Pennsylvania%E2%80%99s%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Program%20Office/WIP3/GetInvolved/Pages/Countywide-Action-Plans.aspx"">called County Action Plans</a>. The 43 counties in the watershed were divided into two phases, depending on how much nitrogen and phosphorus they contribute to our streams. The eight Phase 1 counties are already implementing their plans and reporting progress back to DEP. The remaining Phase 2 counties are grouped into 10 clusters with plans due to DEP by the end of September. The local county-level efforts will help to catalyze and report action on the ground and provide DEP with input on what is needed to be successful. </p><ul><li>The Rapid Delisting Strategy</li></ul><p>The Lancaster Clean Water Partners, working with the Chesapeake Conservancy, put together a data-driven rapid delisting strategy for impaired, or polluted, waters to help prioritize the work being done in Lancaster County, which accounts for 21% of Pennsylvania's nitrogen reduction goals and 23% for phosphorus. This prioritization strategy is based on how healthy an impaired stream is, existing work within a watershed, and is focused on large landowners. Out of 5,100 farms in the county, the Lancaster CAP prioritizes 1,200 farms which helps technical service providers and other conservation organizations to know where focused efforts could make the biggest impact on local stream health. The delisting strategy could be used in other counties to speed up improvements to local stream health.</p><ul><li>Center for Water Quality Excellence</li></ul><p>The Phase 3 WIP proposed the creation of a pilot <a href=""https://www.cwqe.org/"">Center for Water Quality Excellence</a>, led by PENNVEST, where municipalities, farmers, and other interested parties could go to learn more about best management practices and funding opportunities. The pilot Center is now open to serve Lancaster and York Counties. If this model proves to be successful, PENNVEST could open other locations to serve additional counties. In addition to providing one-on-one consulting opportunities, the Center will be offering workshops.</p><ul><li>Phase 3 WIP Amendment and Milestone Reporting</li></ul><p>At EPA's request, DEP will submit an amendment to the Phase 3 WIP by the end of the year. The original Phase 3 WIP fell short on its plan to achieve the nitrogen reduction goal. The amendment is expected to include the 34 County Action Plans and the implementation and adjustments that have happened over the past 2 years. DEP pointed out challenges will be included in the document, including the COVID pandemic stalling progress due to the lost of construction season and increased construction costs. In addition, as part of the accountability framework of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL, DEP provides milestone reports to EPA for progress and on 2-year commitments. We eagerly await the Phase 3 Amendment and milestone reporting to assess progress toward Pennsylvania's goals and to see if the state has a complete plan to meet 100% of the nitrogen goal. </p><p><u>Where progress is still lacking</u></p><p>Despite all the work being done by the state agencies and partners on the ground, this meeting reaffirmed funding from the legislature remains the main hurdle to overcome.</p><p><strong>We call on the legislature to take swift action on the following policies when they return to Harrisburg in late September.</strong></p><ul><li>The Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program</li></ul><p>SB 465 would create a new statewide agricultural cost share program providing farmers and landowners with assistance to install conservation practices which benefit clean water and farms. The program would be administered by the State Conservation Commission and local decisions would be made through County Conservation Districts. These investments would prioritize counties where agriculture has a greater impact on stream health. </p><ul><li>Growing Greener III</li></ul><p>SB 525 would invest $500 million of the federal American Rescue Plan to reinvigorate the state's Growing Greener Program that was passed with bipartisan support over 20 years ago. This program supports community-driven work conservation and clean water projects across the state.</p><ul><li>The Clean Streams Fund</li></ul><p>A cosponsor memo by Senator Yaw calls for $250 million of federal American Rescue Plan money to be directed to a water quality improvement dedicated fund. This funding could help improve stream health that is impacted by nonpoint source runoff, such as agriculture, acid mine drainage, and stormwater runoff.</p><ul><li>The Lawn Fertilizer Bill</li></ul><p>SB 251 would significantly improve the water quality impacted by nutrient pollution in Pennsylvania by reducing application rates of lawn fertilizer, creating a professional certification program, and standardizing label requirements for lawns, golf courses, and athletic fields. Over 2,600 miles of the Commonwealth's streams are impaired due to excess nutrients, which is the fifth leading cause of water pollution.</p><p>The countdown to December 31, 2025 grows shorter everyday. The state agencies and counties are doing their part to build the systems and programs to get the job done. It's far past time for the legislature to step up to the plate. And right now, with $7 billion in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan, there are no longer any excuses remaining to hold off on investing in our state's clean water resources, which benefit the economy, create and sustain jobs, and improve quality of life and public health. Swift action on the legislation mentioned here would be a good start in the right direction.</p>",Climate; Community; Environment,"Renee Reber, Campaign Manager, Watershed Advocacy"

It has been reported that Philadelphia has approximately 3,200 miles of pipe, which means that 480 miles of pipe were built at a time when horses were still the primary mode of transportation.</p><p>There is so much to admire about the built world that we were able to create through advances in technology and the sheer audacity of the human spirit. I am sure that there was a time when cast iron water main pipes were revolutionary. Now, towns and cities across America are squeezing the last life out of creaking and groaning infrastructure that cannot possibly be expected to deal with the challenges presented by climate change.</p><p>We are seeing the troubling signs of climate change across the globe: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/world/asia/china-climate-change.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage"">flooding in China</a>, heat and monsoons <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/world/asia/india-landslides-floods.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage"">in India</a>, a tropical storm <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-evacuates-thousands-monsoon-rains-flood-cities-provinces-2021-07-24/"">in the Philippines</a>, and heavy rainfall <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/world/europe/flooding-germany-belgium-switzerland-netherlands.html"">in Western Europe</a>. We are experiencing similar phenomena in America, too, as temperatures continue to rise and heavy rains continue to fall. We are also experiencing the damage done to our homes and businesses as our aged infrastructure struggles to keep pace with a harsher climate.</p><p>This weekend's water main break is only the latest indication that we risk far more by doing nothing than what we risk with a novel approach to rebuild our nation's infrastructure. Queen Village residents have called the scene ""apocalyptic"" and likened the latest sinkhole to an asteroid strike.

If we are truly willing to invest trillions of dollars into building back better, then let's make sure we do just that. Philadelphia's water mains are bursting at the seams due to wear and tear, but it would be a mistake to focus on upgrading pipes that were built before Theodore Roosevelt became President. The best way to build back better is to chart a new course that does not rely on pipes and pavement.</p><p>The City of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Water Department have been working to address its aging infrastructure for nearly ten years. Beginning in 2011, the city sought a new way to rebuild its stormwater infrastructure to better combat polluted runoff and the impact of heavy floods through green stormwater infrastructure (GSI). The Green City, Clean Waters program <a href=""/Blog-Item-Report-highlights-success-of-Philadelphias-Green-City-Clean-Waters-Program"">is a proven model for success</a> that represents truly fundamental change in the way we think of infrastructure in America. Prioritizing nature-based solutions that promote people over pavement allows municipalities to simultaneously increase preparedness for the impact of climate change and begin to address the harm caused to communities of color through decades of deliberate exclusion and disinvestment. GSI projects that incorporate green space like tree trenches and rain gardens provide relief to urban communities through reducing air temperatures and helping to <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/isaias-emergency-eastwick-residents-call-for-city-state-aid-after-devastating-flooding/"">decrease the risk of flooding.</a></p><p>Cities across the world <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/europe/london-flooding-infrastructure-climate-intl-cmd/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_source=twCNN&utm_content=2021-07-26T21%3A00%3A12&utm_medium=social"">are grappling with the grim reality</a> that they are not prepared for the impact of climate change. There are those in America who will tell us that we cannot afford to reimagine our nation's infrastructure. They will argue that American ingenuity cannot account for the weather. Senators will <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/infrastructure-talks-near-finish-as-senators-face-time-pressure"">balk at increased spending</a> to deal with the myriad issues plaguing our nation's water systems. We can choose to squeeze the very last drop of life out of pipes better left to a bygone age. We know what the consequences will be: swift-water rescues to save people from drowning in city streets, sinkholes swallowing SUVs, and millions in damages.</p><p>But American ingenuity did not die in 1981, 1891, or 1776. We only must choose to face this next great challenge with the same audacity and creativity that led us to create the built world that surrounds us.

Pennsylvania Supreme Court Rules that Drilling Revenues from State Forests Must be Used for Conservation,7/28/2021,"<p>Last week, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court <a href=""https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-78-2020mo - 104840407140939594.pdf?cb=1"">ruled that it is unconstitutional under the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA)</a> for the General Assembly to transfer oil and gas lease funds designated for environmental conservation to the general fund for non-conservation purposes. This decision, appropriately dubbed ""PEDF IV,"" concludes a six-year legal battle between the Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Foundation (PEDF) and the Commonwealth.</p><p>The General Assembly established a lease fund in 1955 under the Lease Fund Act to receive ""all rents and royalties from oil and gas leases"" on Commonwealth land, and exclusively dedicated to environmental conservation purposes. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resource (DCNR) is charged with overseeing all oil and gas leases and contracts on these publicly owned lands, and all moneys in the fund are to be appropriated to the DCNR for carrying out the purpose of the fund.</p><p>From 1955 to 2008, the leases generated a total of $165 million. Then in 2009, the DCNR leased approximately 74,000 acres for Marcellus Shale drilling which generated close to $600 million. These revenues were made up of upfront bonus payments, annual rental fees, royalties for the marketable gas extracted, and interest penalties for late payments. Inspired by the large influx of revenue, the General Assembly added four new provisions to the Fiscal Code which essentially worked to restrict the allocation of lease fund monies to DCNR and redirect them to the general fund to help balance the state budget. This marked the start of the PEDF litigation.</p><p>In 2017, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court established in PEDF II that the ERA, Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, creates an express public trust subject to Pennsylvania private trust law with the purpose of conserving and maintaining the state's public natural resources ""for the benefit of all the people."" The ERA designates the Commonwealth as trustee, the people as the named beneficiaries, and Pennsylvania's public natural resources as the corpus (or body) of the trust.</p><p>PEDF II critically and clearly accepted the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's 2016 plurality's holding in Robinson Township v. Commonwealth, that this public trust imposes trustee obligations on the Commonwealth to (1) prohibit the degradation, diminution, and depletion of our public natural resources, whether these harms might result from direct state action or from the actions of private parties, and (2) the Commonwealth must act affirmatively via legislative action to protect the environment. It also rejected the previous three-part ERA test set forth in <em>Payne v. Kassab.</em></p><p>The PEDF II Court also ruled that two of the Fiscal Code provisions relating to oil and gas royalties (1602-E and 1603-E) were facially unconstitutional because they directed the royalties away from the trust corpus. Remember, the corpus under the ERA is Pennsylvania's public natural resources, and PEDF II had to figure out what to do if those natural resources are sold. According to Pennsylvania private trust law, revenue from the sale of trust assets constitute trust principle, and trust principle must remain part of the corpus of the trust. Royalties from the sale of oil and gas represent the sale of trust assets, and are therefore trust principle.</p><p>The Court then remanded the case back to the Commonwealth court to determine whether the other two provisions transferring money from the lease fund to the general fund (1604-E and 1605-E) were also unconstitutional. This required a determination of how the other revenues (the bonus payments, annual rental fees, and interest penalties) should be categorized under private trust law principles.</p><p>Taking a step back, typically in an oil and gas lease, the company pays several different payments for the lease/right to extract. The bonus payment is a one-time payment made by the company to secure the lease during a formal bidding process. The company then pays an annual rental fee to maintain its right to explore the area for oil and gas. Interest penalties are penalties related to late rental payments. Finally, the company pays royalties to the commonwealth based on the amount of marketable gas it extracts.</p><p>Under Pennsylvania private trust law, rental payments generated from trust assets are classified as trust income and can be distributed to trust beneficiaries. On remand in 2019, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court in PEDF III determined that the rents, bonuses, and interest penalties constitute income, and interpreted the ERA to recognize two distinct classes of beneficiaries: the current living citizens of Pennsylvania as life tenants and all future citizens as remaindermen. The court determined that since the ERA didn't specify how the proceeds should be allocated between successive beneficiaries (the life tenants and remaindermen) the trust laws from when the ERA was adopted (the 1947 Principle Income Act) would govern, thereby directing the income to go to the life tenants. This led the court to conclude that the transfer of revenue to the general fund was constitutional as it represented income distributed to the trust's life tenants. PEDF then appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</p><p>Last week's decision reversed PEDF III on the grounds that the ERA does not in fact establish successive trust beneficiaries, and therefore the 1947 trust laws concerning apportionment among successive beneficiaries do not apply. The Commonwealth Court in PEDF III interpreted the phrase ""for the benefit of all the people"" in the ERA in isolation to mean that allocating the trust income to the general budget would benefit all the people, and would therefore be permissible.</p><p>In discussing the ERA, the Court explained that ""[t]he text does not distinguish between 'current Pennsylvanians' and future generations. Instead, generations yet to come are included within the broadly defined beneficiary: 'all the people.'"" And as the Court in PEDF II explained, ""The Commonwealth's fiduciary duty to ""conserve and maintain"" our public natural resources is a duty owed to the beneficiaries of the public trust, namely ""the people, including generations yet to come,"" as set forth in the second sentence of Section 27."" This essentially means that the Commonwealth, as the trustee, cannot distinguish or prioritize the needs of current Pennsylvanians and future Pennsylvanians by spending trust income on general budgetary matters because ""the ERA created simultaneous beneficiaries with equal interests in the trust's management.""</p><p>Public trusts for natural resources are not a novel concept, and they exist in every state through either constitutional provisions, statutes, or common law (i.e., court decisions) to protect an area's natural resources for the benefit of the present and future public. However, current public trust law for natural resources is vary sparse and lawyers and the courts will often draw on private trust law to help answer questions that arise that are not answered by public trust law - as was done in the PEDF line of cases.</p><p>While there are no binding rules on the type of trust law that should be used to fill these gaps, some legal professionals <a href=""https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2516&context=mjlr"">have strong opinions on how to apply private trust principles</a> to public trusts so as to uphold the intent and purpose of the public trust. Professor John Dernbach, for example, stresses that the income maximization aspects of private trust law should not be used to define the duties and limits of a public trustee as they are incompatible with the purpose of public trusts for natural resources.</p><p>We have also seen recently how these principals can be perverted into an argument in favor of depleting Pennsylvania's natural resources. Pennsylvania State Senators Gene Yaw and Lisa Baker (joined by the Pennsylvania Republican Caucus and several municipalities) <a href=""/News-Environmental-Groups-Law-Center-File-Friend-of-Court-Brief-in-Opposition-to-Challenge-to-Delaware-River-Basin-Commission-Fracking-Ban"">attempted to challenge a ban on fracking</a> within the Delaware River Basin passed by the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) by essentially arguing that they have public trust duties under section 27 of the ERA as individual legislators to exploit the State's natural resources for economic gain. They argued that the fracking ban harms the Commonwealth and its citizens by ""interfering with the reasonable investment-backed expectations of landowners,"" and diminishing the property value of land in the Basin.</p><p><a href=""/Blog-Item-Federal-Court-Dismissed-Lawsuit-Challenging-DRBCs-Ban-on-Fracking"">In an unsurprising victory</a>, the District Court <a href=""/Files/Admin/Opinion-on-Dismissing-Yaw-Suit.pdf"">rejected these arguments</a> on the basis that the two senators are not ERA trustees and have no standing to bring the complaint. Arguments like the one brought by Senators Yaw and Baker which grossly misinterpret the ERA are why it is so important to remain diligent in ensuring that the ERA is used to its fullest and most correct purpose to <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=00&div=0&chpt=1&sctn=27&subsctn=0"">""protect our rights to clean air, water, and the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.""</a></p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Emily Rollins, Legal Intern"
Maine’s Innovative Response to Plastics Pollution and What the Rest of Us Can Learn From it,7/27/2021,"<p>China remains the world's largest producer of plastic, but<a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/us-worlds-number-one-source-plastic-waste-180976214/"">research has shown that the United States</a> was the world's number one source of plastic waste as of 2016, pushing 42 million metric tons into the environment. Americans also use more plastic per capita than any other country on the planet at roughly 286 pounds per person.</p><p>Because the U.S. lacks the waste management infrastructure to recycle all its plastic waste, the country transports about half of its recyclable materials to other countries. However, this has been complicated by <a href=""https://www.dw.com/en/amid-plastic-deluge-southeast-asia-refuses-western-waste/a-49467769"">China's 2018 announcement to stop the importation</a> of plastic waste, followed by announcements by other Southeast Asian states such as Thailand in 2021, Vietnam by 2025, India, and even Turkey. Clearly, something must be done to tackle our plastic waste problem in the U.S., and states like Maine might be leading the way and teaching us all a thing or two about finally solving this issue.</p><p>According to a 2018 study cited by the Environmental Protection Agency, containers and packaging (namely ""bags, sacks and wraps; other packaging; polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and jars; high-density polyethylene (HDPE) natural bottles; and other containers"") <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/plastics-material-specific-data"">rankas the most used plastic in the U.S.</a> at over 14.5 million tons.</p><p>For the past thirty years, U.S. states have begun to pass individual statewide legislation to curb the usage of plastic bags. In 1991, <a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx"">Maine became the first state to enact legislation</a> requiring recycling efforts at retail stores. The law prevents retailers from supplying plastic bags unless they provide a convenient storefront receptacle to ensure used bags are collected and recycled. Since then at least four other states-California, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island-and the District of Columbia have followed their lead.</p><p>However, as we have previously noted <a href=""/Blog-Item-Recycling-is-exacerbating-the-plastic-waste-crisis"">in our PennFuture Blog</a>, plastic recycling by the consumer alone will not solve the plastics pollution crisis our global environment is facing, <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-produced-recycling-waste-ocean-trash-debris-environment"">as just 9 percent of global plastic waste</a> is recycled. PennFuture has previously argued that the world must transition away from plastic packaging altogether. As of this writing, eight states-California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New York, Oregon and Vermont-<a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx"">have banned single-use plastic bags.</a></p><p>Arguably, a major step towards the total elimination of plastic packaging can be seen in Maine's new extended producer responsibility (EPR) policy for packaging which makes it all the more costly for companies to use plastic packaging, among other types as well.</p><p>Maine's new EPR law begins to shift the burden on recycling from the consumer to the producer by requiring producers <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/climate/maine-recycling-law-EPR.html"">to cover 100 percent of its municipalities' recycling costs.</a> Maine's Department of Environmental Protection<a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90655072/maine-companies-will-now-have-to-pay-to-help-fix-the-broken-recycling-system?utm_source=postup&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=world-changing-ideas&position=9&partner=newsletter&campaign_date=07172021"">will set fees for different types of packaging</a>. Companies will be charged on the amount of packaging waste they create in the state, with higher fees charged for materials that are more difficult to recycle. The fees will drop when companies redesign and replace old packaging for more recyclable ones, or increase the amount of recycled content in their packaging. This eco-modulation system ""incentivizes less packaging and better packaging"" <a href=""https://www.wastedive.com/news/extended-producer-responsibility-packaging-maine-oregon/602479/"">according to State Rep. Nicole Grohoski</a>, one of the bill's primary sponsors.</p><p>Maine's DEP will partner with a ""packing stewardship"" organization that will run the program and will offer companies assistance in designing packaging that better fits the system. The organization will need to report data such as tonnage of packaging collected and provide funding for infrastructure and education improvements.</p><p>While 33 states currently have EPR laws, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/climate/maine-recycling-law-EPR.html"">they are far more narrow</a>; typically focusing on specific products like used mattresses and tubs of paint. Even in this narrow application, Connecticut's mattress, paint, electronic and thermostat EPR programs have diverted more than 26 million pounds of waste since 2008, <a href=""https://www.productstewardship.us/news/328753/Extended-Producer-Responsibility-Programs-Proven-Successful-in-Connecticut.htm"">according to one study.</a></p><p>Packaging-centric EPR policies have achieved success worldwide as well. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/climate/maine-recycling-law-EPR.html"">In Quebec, Canada</a>, a similar program <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kruger-packaging-invests-250-million-in-the-trois-rivieres-mill-527461141.html"">results in $250 million sent back to communities</a> for recycling purposes each year. Around 63% of packaging <a href=""https://www.clf.org/blog/recycling-reform-producer-responsibility-maine-pollution/"">is recycled in Quebec</a>, versus an average of 25% in the U.S. A study by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality of Canadian EPR programs found that consumer product prices had increased <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/arts/design/recycling-packaging-new-york.html"">by only $0.0056 per item.</a></p><p>Plastic pollution is undoubtedly an issue in Pennsylvania. Studies have estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic in our oceans than fish. On average, in a single year, <a href=""https://environmentamerica.org/reports/pac/microplastics-pennsylvania"">the Philadelphia Water Department removes 44 tons</a> of trash from a 32 mile stretch of the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers, 56% of which was plastic waste, according to a PennEnvironment report. In Pennsylvania, plastic is the most common form of visible litter. In fact, the Department of Transportation spends over $13 million every year cleaning up just roadside litter. The problem is so widespread that nine of the largest cities in Pennsylvania spend over $68.5 million every year on litter and illegal dumping, with $46.7 million of that going toward litter abatement.</p><p>Pennsylvanias very low cost in sending trash to landfills and incinerators <a href=""https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-introduces-legislation-to-restrict-flow-of-trash-into-pa-from-other-states"">places Pennsylvania as among the largest importers</a> of out-of-state waste in the nation. At the same time, Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection, facing cuts in their funding by the legislature, <a href=""https://wjactv.com/news/local/dep-cancels-statewide-recycling-implementation-grants-for-first-time-in-33-years"">has cut grant funding</a> for the state's recycling program in 2021.</p><p>With the plastics pollution issue increasing in Pennsylvania in the face of cuts to traditional recycling programs, it is time to change course. Maine has shown us that legislators can stand up to the plastics manufacturers and larger petrochemical industry and force them to take responsibility for the plastic pollution they are putting into the marketplace, and by extension, the environment at virtually no cost to the consumer.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"John Ukenye, Policy Analyst"
The Problem with Carbon Capture and Sequestration,7/26/2021,"<p>Leaders around the world, including PA Governor, Tom Wolf have been pushing for investments in Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technology. CCS is a technology that pulls carbon out of the air, usually when it is released at facilities like power plants, and buries it underground to keep it from reaching the atmosphere. Some have claimed that this is a miracle technology that will save us from climate change. Yet, there is little support for this staggering claim.</p><p>Captured carbon is most often used to directly further the production of fossil fuels from oil and gas fields while providing an overall excuse that our continued reliance on fossil fuels is ok, because CCS will be here to save us. We cannot allow the promise of future carbon reduction to continue to prolong our reliance on technologies that are already causing <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-is-central-to-californias-wildfires/"">devastating consequences to our environment.</a></p><p>As mentioned before, CCS is a technology that takes already-released carbon out of the air and transports it to a location where it can be sequestered and kept out of the atmosphere. According to <a href=""https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC_GLOBAL_STATUS_REPORT_2019.pdf"">the Global CCS Institute</a>, as of 2019, global CCS capacity is at around 40 million metric tons of CO2 per year. This is only a drop in the bucket when put in the context <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions"">of the over 36 billion tons a year</a> that is currently being emitted. CCS promises big results in cutting emissions. One facility in Texas for example, <a href=""https://www.nrg.com/case-studies/petra-nova.html"">claims that over a 3-year period</a> between 2016 and 2019 it successfully sequestered 99.08% of carbon emissions, equal to 3,831,818 short tons of CO2. However, in this facility, as in many others, captured carbon is often used to promote more fossil fuel production elsewhere. In reality this means that emissions will be higher as a result of the carbon that was captured.<br /><br /><u>Background on CCS</u></p><p>There are <a href=""https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/carbon-capture-and-storage-101/"">three types of carbon capture technologies</a> that are used to capture the carbon at its source. The most common, particularly in existing power plants, is post combustion carbon capture, where the CO2 is separated from the exhaust that results from the combustion process. Then there is pre-combustion carbon capture which is used in industrial processes but is still in the very early stages for power plants and it is cost prohibitive to try to retrofit an existing powerplant with the technology. In pre-combustion carbon capture, fuel is gasified allowing the CO2 to be separated. Lastly there is oxy-fuel combustion where the fuel is burned in an (almost) pure oxygen environment allowing the CO2 emissions to become more concentrated and thus easier to capture. After the CO2 is captured, it is compressed into a fluid, transported to a storage site, and then eventually injected underground where it can be kept long term to keep from reaching the atmosphere.</p><p>Early versions of Carbon capture technology <a href=""https://ieaghg.org/docs/General_Docs/Publications/Information_Sheets_for_CCS_2.pdf"">actually date back to the 1920s</a>, when it was used for separating CO2 that was found in natural gas reservoirs from the saleable methane. Since the 1970s, captured CO2 has been piped to oil fields to boost oil recovery in a process known as <a href=""http://www.netl.doe.gov/oil-gas/oil-recovery"">Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)</a>, leading to millions of tons of CO2 being piped into oil fields every year. Injecting CO2 for EOR can lead to 20-40% higher oil production in an oil field. Although the CO2 can be left there permanently to sequester it, the production of increased oil still leads to this method creating increased carbon emissions. CCS for the sake of keeping carbon out of the atmosphere to try to halt climate change <a href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/beccs-the-story-of-climate-changes-saviour-technology"">gained prominence only in the first years</a> of the new century.</p><p><u>The Problem with CCS</u></p><p>The promise of CCS is dramatically overstated. CCS is not cost efficient. It is extremely expensive and thus cost prohibitive to apply to existing sources of pollution, so theonly use case is to construct CCS facilities on new fossil fuel plants. We must stop constructing new fossil fuel plants. Not only are they dangerous, <a href=""https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2020/"">but it is not cost effective</a>. It would be cheaper to construct new wind or solar than to invest in CCS.</p><p>Despite showing some early promise, <a href=""https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage"">according to the IEA</a>, as of 2020, there were only 21 CCS facilities operating globally, with another 44 in various stages of development. While CCS may sound promising in concept, it very much remains to be seen whether it will be possible to develop the technology to a scale where it could actually make a significant difference in the climate crisis. It will certainly be extremely expensive, and will draw funds away from renewable energy technology. This could not only delay the construction of renewable energy that is already available but could also delay innovation into new, more advanced forms of clean, renewable energy. This means that we are investing in an unnecessary technology that could never come to fruition instead of trying to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels now with technology that is already ready to be deployed.</p><p><u>CCS in Pennsylvania</u></p><p>This has been demonstrated be true for Pennsylvania as well. Governor Wolf has announced that PA is joining other states to create a coalition to develop regional CCS infrastructure. Pennsylvania's Secretary of the Department of Community and Economic Development, Dennis Davin, has declared that ""Carbon capture technologies provide a critical component to addressing our climate challenge."" In the <a href=""https://carboncaptureready.betterenergy.org/"">announcement mentioned above</a>, the administration shared literature that declares that ""states are ready for Carbon Capture."" However, Governor Wolf's own administration <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/pennsylvania-joins-6-states-in-commitment-to-plan-for-co2-transport-infrastructure/"">clearly seems to disagree.</a></p><p>As part of the permitting process for the proposed Renovo Energy Center, a gas fired power plant in Clinton County, the Department of Environmental Protection concluded that currently CCS is not commercially feasible and dismissed it as a way to reduce the emissions of the facility. Standing alone, this might be a plausible conclusion. However, if CCS is really as critical and available as the administration believes, why is the DEP dismissing it as unfeasible for one of the few plants that may have been able to invest in it in PA? CCS is being presented as a pathway to continue moving along an environmentally destructive and carbon-heavy trajectory, while industrial operations are not actually being required to utilize the technology at all. All of this further evidences, as discussed above, that, in reality, CCS is infeasible for any number of new or existing facilities.</p><p>It is a serious cause for concern that CCS is being held up as a justification to continue to burn fossil fuels indefinitely (while seemingly avoiding the environmental catastrophe the data clearly show is coming) while in practice, CCS <a href=""https://www.utilitydive.com/news/coal-fired-carbon-capture-projects-are-a-waste-of-tax-dollars/602209/"">appears to be a costly</a> (<a href=""https://theclimateconnection.org/carbon-capture-storage-how-cost-effective-is-it/"">and cost ineffective</a>) project with little hope of actually succeeding at the levels needed and <a href=""https://theclimateconnection.org/carbon-capture-should-public-companies-continue-to-fund-it/"">a history of overpromising and underdelivering.</a> The risks <a href=""https://theclimateconnection.org/carbon-capture-and-storage-pros-cons/"">associated with prioritizing CCS</a> include unfair competition for funding and subsidies that could be used for sustainable energy generation like wind or solar and <a href=""https://www.utilitydive.com/news/coal-fired-carbon-capture-projects-are-a-waste-of-tax-dollars/602209/"">also prolonging the life of aging coal and gas plants</a> without actually achieving their goals of large scale carbon capture. So far CCS facilities continuously fallen short of their lofty claims, while the political powers that be are free to rest on their laurels after proclaiming that CCS is about to fix the climate crisis (and continue to throw good money after this inefficient, costly technology).</p><p>Instead of averting climate disaster, CCS appears to be another step down our current path of climate destruction under a thin veil of progress. It remains to be seen if CCS will ever manage to create an effective band aid in the fight against climate change, but it is clear that as long as it prolongs our reliance on fossil fuels it will continue to be bring about harm.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Daniela Rakhlina-Powsner, Legal Intern"
What comes next for plastic bags in Pennsylvania?,7/23/2021,"<p>July began with the expiration of a statewide restriction on banning the use of plastic bags. The development is welcomed news for municipalities across the Commonwealth implementing or considering bans on the ubiquitous plastic that too often finds its way into local waterways as litter or becomes a costly contaminant in recycling systems.</p><p>Credit likely goes to the <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/health-lawsuits-coronavirus-pandemic-philadelphia-environment-76b04dcd3e8c2b21d5a467e0f2e56cc8"">legal challenge led by Philadelphia and other Southeastern Pennsylvania municipalities</a> and joined by Pittsburgh. Their lawsuit likely discouraged the General Assembly's Republican leadership from renewing the bag-ban moratorium.</p><p>Originally passed in 2019, the amendment to Act 23 prohibited enacting or enforcing any tax that would discourage the use or sale of single-use plastic. After the General Assembly extended the one-year restriction in 2020, this year the July 1 extension deadline came and went as quietly as a plastic bag drifting in the wind.</p><p><a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/news/2021/06/philadelphia-and-pittsburgh-move-ahead-with-plastic-bag-bans-as-pas-preemption-nears-its-end.html"">Media reports suggest ""pending litigation""</a> that revealed the moratorium's unconstitutional approach may have played a role in legislators' decision not to extend the ban - for now, at least.</p><p><u>Are the days of plastic bags coming to an end?</u></p><p>This fall, the General Assembly could still take action to limit bag bans. Philadelphia's lawsuit mostly centers on the moratorium's procedural tactics.</p><p>With local plastics manufacturers and lobbyists representing the grocery industry still opposed to local bans, supporters in the General Assembly could potentially attempt to overcome their mistakes and find new ways to prevent limits on single-use plastic.</p><p>The fact that this is up for debate shows how backward-minded our state's plastics approach has become. Nationwide, <a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx"">a dozen states ban single-use plastic</a> at the state or county levels. Virginia state law specifically allows municipalities to issue fees on single-use plastic if local leaders so choose. </p><p><u>Cities move forward</u></p><p>In the meantime, local action to transition away from single-use plastics is gaining momentum. </p><p>The same day that the statewide moratorium expired, Philadelphia announced implementation of the city's single-use plastic bags ordinance would begin, <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/2020-12-30-updated-timeline-for-implementation-of-plastic-bag-ban"">with enforcement starting April 1.</a></p><p>Philadelphia's legislation prohibits retailers from using carryout or delivery plastic bags less than 2.25 mils thick. The city will also prevent use of paper bags that contain less than 40 percent recycled content.</p><p>Pittsburgh appears next in line. City Council <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/single-use-plastics-ban-cleared-for-pa-cities-as-pittsburgh-moves-to-eliminate-plastic-bags/Content?oid=19763862"">passed a resolution in May</a> saying that the city intends to pass a ban on single-use plastic bags in the near future.</p><p>With Pennsylvania's two largest cities taking action to eliminate plastic waste, other towns and cities are likely to follow their lead.</p><p><u>Environmental and financial benefits</u></p><p>Let's take a moment to remember why getting rid of single-use plastics is a move in the right direction. Recent studies <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069618305291"">found plastic bag bans in other states</a> and cities resulted in significant reduction in plastic bag consumption - in some cases, a decrease of more than 70 percent.</p><p>Benefits of switching from single-use plastic bags to reusable bags include:</p><ul><li>Less Litter: Plastic bags don't like to stay in one place. Wind-blown bags escape from trash bins, dump trucks and landfills to pollute our streets, parks, streams and rivers.Currently, the equivalent of <a href=""https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/the-new-plastics-economy-rethinking-the-future-of-plastics"">one dump truck of plastic litter enters our oceans</a> every day. Microplastics can hang in the air, <a href=""https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/04/a-shocking-discovery-shows-just-how-far-wind-can-carry-microplastics/"">perhaps traveling 100 miles or more downwind</a>. That's why even our most pristine places are getting covered in plastic trash.</li><li>Cost Savings for Local Governments: In recent years, the value of recycled waste has declined, leaving municipalities with narrow operating margins when processing local waste. Single-use plastic offers no post-consumer value, making it even harder to be profitable when recycling. In fact, plastic bags can jam equipment at material recovery facilities, at times causing the entire recycling facility to shut down. Such work shortages <a href=""https://azdailysun.com/news/local/phoenix-recycling-officials-plastic-bags-contribute-to-lost-time-worth/article_7ec39600-c28f-5e4c-bb12-b3bb726e7ac9.html"">have cost cities millions of dollars.</a></li><li>Reduction in Pollution: Plastics are manufactured <a href=""/frackingandpetrochemicals"">using resource-intensive petrochemical processes</a> that require burning significant amounts of fossil fuel, contaminating local air and contributing to the climate crisis.</li><li>Affordable Convenience: Consumers adopt new behaviors when their options change. To help with this transition, reusable or recyclable alternatives are widely available, affordable and practical. Free tote bags should continue to be handed out at public events. Local leaders can also allocate funds to programs that help to ensure fees on single-use plastic are not punitive on marginalized members of society. In cities like Washington, D.C., proceeds are spent on environmental remediation and education efforts that directly benefit members of the community.</li></ul><p>To ensure Pennsylvania does our part to address the growing challenge of plastic waste, PennFuture will continue to monitor the General Assembly and advocate for commonsense policies. Phasing out single-use plastics makes sense both environmentally and economically.</p><p>But if those arguments fail, perhaps those who celebrate liberty should embrace the right for cities and towns to make their own decisions, including the choice of how they manage their own waste.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jessica O'Neill, Senior Attorney"
Economic Impact Report Commissioned by Shell Doesn’t Tell the Whole Story. Far From It.,7/22/2021,"<p>A report released by researchers at Robert Morris University last week grabbed headlines across western Pennsylvania: once up and running next year, Royal Dutch Shell's massive plastics factory on the banks of the Ohio River in Beaver County will generate nearly $3.7 billion in economic activity annually in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Unfortunately, these types of industry-funded sales pitches presented as ""studies are an effective tactic used by the fossil fuel industry <a href=""https://archive.triblive.com/business/local-stories/pennsylvania-tax-incentive-plan-played-major-role-in-luring-shell-cracker-plant/"">to gain taxpayer subsidies</a> and a license to pollute in exchange for promised economic development that may never materialize.</p><p>To that end, a high-ranking Shell official didn't miss the chance to spin this report to fit the company narrative: the fossil fuel giant is ""proud of the positive impact we are having on the local, regional and state economies,"" <a href=""https://www.rmu.edu/about/news/rmu-study-shell-ethane-cracker-will-add-nearly-4-billion-each-year-pennsylvania-economy"">Senior Vice President Hillary Mercer said</a>, ""and we look forward to remaining a valued neighbor and employer of choice in the region for decades to come.""</p><p>Mercer mentioned the importance of being a ""valued neighbor"" in the community, but what does that mean? The RMU report contained nearly 10,000 words typed across 32 pages: the word ""jobs"" appeared 40 times, while ""billion"" appeared a total of 43 times. ""Pollution,"" ""climate change,"" ""cancer,"" and ""health impacts"" appeared zero times.</p><p>Keep in mind that this industrial behemoth, which hopes to turn ethane into resins used to manufacture single-use plastics, could emit upward of 2.2 million tons of carbon pollution annually along with air toxics and other chemicals. Once operational, it will skyrocket near the top of the list of worst polluters in all of western Pennsylvania, but RMU report didn't assess, cite, or factor in the public health impacts of facilities like this, which history has shown have severe effects-one only needs to look at petrochemical hubs in Louisiana and Texas for present day proof. Not considering the very real costs that Pennsylvanians will suffer from the environmental and public health damages is a huge omission, but it's not the only problem with the report.</p><p>Perhaps the most glaring problem is the underlying assumption that this plant will actually be successful. The financial press <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/firms-like-dow-bet-billions-on-plastics-now-theres-a-glut-11602754200"">is already covering the glut in the industry</a> as production outstrips demand and long-time industry leaders like Dow and Chevron are scaling back investments. <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Financial-Risks_Weak-Outlook_Shell-PA-Petrochemical-Complex_June-2020.pdf"">As was reported last year</a>, Shell ""will enter the market amidst a plastics price war among formidable corporations with existing client bases that are reducing prices to maintain their position in a constricted market."" In this environment, success is far from a sure thing.</p><p>The RMU report, for its part, cites ""Suttles, 2020"" and ""Esposito, 2018"" for the assumption that the plant will employ 600 full-time positions. Readers could be forgiven for assuming those are references to academic papers or some sort of independent analysis of the industry, but that is not the case: both are journalists quoting Shell's own estimations of employment. It's unclear if any of the claims regarding the future performance of this facility come from sources other than Shell or Shell-funded reports.</p><p>In fact, when the authors list their final assumption-that there will be a market for the products of the proposed plant-there is no footnote at all giving a source.</p><p>To be fair, Shell does have one thing going for it that competitors like Dow, Chevron, and ExxonMobile don't-Pennsylvania is providing them the largest tax subsidy in the state's history, worth as much as $1.65 billion. This expenditure, along with the very real costs of the additional pollution including direct medical expenses, lost work, and environmental damage, don't appear on the other side of the ledger when Shell makes its lofty claims.</p><p>The problem for Shell-and the rest of us-is that these negative externalities are very real, and very costly. Negative externalities are industry-created costs that are incurred by society rather than the industry at fault, things such as air and water pollution, increased sickness and public health burdens, and contributing to a climate crisis that is already at a tipping point worldwide.</p><p>Beaver County residents don't have to look far for <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/environment-energy/2021-07-18/puc-seeks-comment-on-1-million-fine-for-beaver-county-blast"">a blatant example of a negative externality</a>: in September 2018, the Revolution Pipeline exploded in Center Township, leveling one home, killing several animals, and destroying six high-voltage electricity transmission towers, among other damages. Another negative externality is <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2021/03/17/Falcon-Shell-ethane-pipeline-Pennsylvania-federal-investigation-whistleblowers/stories/202103160171"">the taxpayer money being spent by state and federal officials</a> on an investigation into Shell's Falcon pipeline, which will carry up to 107,000 barrels of ethane to the cracker plant daily.</p><p>In a report issued earlier this year <a href=""/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">regarding fossil fuel subsidies</a>, PennFuture predicted at least $400 million in negative externalities in air pollution associated with Shell's plant alone, a number that did not factor in plastics pollution in nearby rivers and waterbodies. Considering the Shell plant will produce up to 1.6 million tons of plastic per year, the real cost of these negative externalities is likely much higher.</p><p>It's one thing for a company to commission a study about itself, and then use the results of that study in its massive public relations efforts. It's another thing entirely for any entity -be it academic, media, industry or otherwise-to study or publicize economic impacts without factoring in every negative externality that comes with a warming planet and changing climate. Any results of such a study should be rendered null and void.</p><p>Instead, media outlets ran with the story, with some of them failing to mention that Shell paid for the study, let alone that the study did not factor in these negative externalities.</p><p>These kinds of studies serve one purpose, and one purpose only: to shift the narrative away from pollution, sickness and taxpayer subsidies, to one of economic impact, jobs and revitalization. It's an integral part of the industrys public relations machine that seeks to convince the public that America needs fossil fuels and extractive industry for prosperity.</p><p>It's time we call this what it is: propaganda.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jared Stonesifer, Director of Media Relations"
New Report Details the Use of “Forever Chemicals” in Fracking Operations Despite Serious Concerns to Public Health,7/20/2021,"<p>The Physicians for Social Responsibility recently released a report titled <a href=""https://www.psr.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fracking-with-forever-chemicals.pdf"">""Fracking with Forever Chemicals""</a> which discusses the current findings and evidence of the use of PFAS in hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, for oil and gas.</p><p>Put simply, these chemicals are very dangerous because they do not break down in the environment, accumulate in the body, and cause significant human health impacts that can result in severe illness and death. PFAS are found in soil and ground- and drinking-waters in multiple communities throughout the United States, including Pennsylvania, from any number of sources, and the inclusion of these forever toxic chemicals in fracking poses even more risk to our communities.</p><p><u>What are PFAS and why are they harmful?</u></p><p>The per- and polyfluorinated substances, <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/pfas/basic-information-pfas"">known as PFAS</a>, are chemicals used to make coatings and products that resist heat, oil, stains, grease, and water. These coatings are used in products such as clothing, adhesives, furniture, food packaging, heat-resistant non-stick cooking surfaces, and the insulation of electrical wire. PFAS are also used in fire-fighting foams. The most studied PFAS chemicals are perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).</p><p>PFAS are known as ""forever chemicals"" because they do not break down in the environment. They can move through a broad range of substances (solid, liquid, gas) and contaminate soils, surface and groundwater, and drinking water sources. Small doses of these chemicals build up in the human body and cause threatening chronic and toxic effects such as liver damage, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, hormone suppression, and cancer, especially in children. For more health effects, <a href=""https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/index.html"">see the fact sheet here.</a></p><p>Not only do small amounts of these highly toxic forever chemicals threaten our health, but the ubiquitous nature of these chemicals increases the threat exponentially. CDC scientists found groups of PFAS in all people tested for it, showing a widespread effect of these chemicals in the US population. <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/"">See the study here</a>. Furthermore, PFAS have been found in drinking water supplies, rivers, lakes, soils, and fish and other wildlife and livestock.</p><p>But shockingly, at this time, PFAS is not a regulated contaminant either by EPA or Pennsylvania. EPA is currently in the process of listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the federal Safe Water Drinking Act (and hopefully other federal environmental statutes) and setting a ""maximum contaminant level"" (MCL), but its current health advisory guidelines are just that - guidelines. PA's process for setting an MCL is dragging along as well, leaving our communities without little to no protections from the toxic forever chemicals.</p><p><u>PFAS in fracking - Worse than we thought</u></p><p>We know that, despite ongoing evidence of contamination and impacts to local residents and livestock, the fracking industry has long opposed any attempts to require the disclosure of the toxic mix of chemicals used in their operations, citing proprietary business information claims.</p><p>This report demonstrates that fracking operations (including well drilling) include the injection of these dangerous forever chemicals through the ground and drinking water and that PFAS can also make it into wastewater produced by fracking. The report discusses that oil and gas companies, including many big companies that have fracked in PA, have used PFAS or substances that can degrade into PFAS in hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas in more than 1,200 wells in six U.S. states between 2012 and 2020.</p><p>As mentioned, these companies refused to identify chemicals they were using for fracking and instead treat these chemicals as ""trade secrets"" and ""proprietary information."" And this is extremely concerning as the report points out: ""The lack of full disclosure of chemicals used in oil and gas operations raises the potential that PFAS could have been used even more extensively than records indicate, both geographically and in other stages of the oil and gas extraction process, such as drilling, that precede the underground injections known as fracking."" Refusal by fracking companies to disclose the myriad toxic and harmful chemicals they use also makes these chemicals almost impossible to study and to find the right medical treatments for those affected by it.</p><p>The impacts to our communities from fracking is no secret (although the chemicals they use remain so), but the inclusion of PFAS in the mix is even worse than we thought.<br /><br /><u>Fracking with PFAS in Pennsylvania</u></p><p>Fracking has been occurring in Pennsylvania since the technology exploded in 2008. The Marcellus Shale covers much of Pennsylvania and is regulated primarily by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Pennsylvania is currently in the number two spot among gas-producing states in the US, thereby leading many Pennsylvanians to be exposed to fracking operations and these toxic forever chemicals.</p><p>In 2020, Pennsylvania's Attorney General issued a report based on a criminal grand jury investigation of oil and gas drilling pollution showing that those living in close proximity to a well pad became chronically and unexplainably ill, especially children that are susceptible to these effects. Also, pets died and farm animals started miscarrying or giving birth to deformed animals. It is suggested that the use of PFAS in fracking is heavily related to this and if these chemicals were found in those six states mentioned in the report, it is highly likely PFAS are used by the fracking companies in Pennsylvania.</p><p>There are many communities that are significantly impacted by fracking in PA, particularly in Washington and Westmoreland County which contain the most fracking wells that resulted in multiple health problems, from nosebleeds to cancer. There are towns in Pennsylvania that have been ruined by fracking. Take for example Dimock, where it was found that heavy concentrations of methane contaminated the drinking water of several dozen families as a result of Cabot Oil and Gas' drilling practices.</p><p>It is important to note that the use of PFAS is not only dangerous for those living by the well pads, where they are injected into the ground, but is also likely to contaminate our environment and poison our communities through the treatment and disposal of fracking wastewater.</p><p>We hope this knowledge will be enough to help move the needle on the regulation of not only fracking water and wastewater, but also of PFAS themselves.</p><p>One example of where this will likely come up sooner than later is with the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC). The DRBC <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fracking-Banned-in-Delaware-River-Basin"">recently banned fracking within the watershed</a>, and in September, the Commission will consider whether to allow the treatment of fracking wastewater in the basin. Previously, the DRBC withdrew its proposed regulations on transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of fracking wastewater within the Basin, along with its proposed regulations on allowing Delaware River Basin water to be exported outside of the basin to be used in fracking operations, arguably because they were not protective of the basin's water quality.</p><p>This report further shows that DRBC should also ban the treatment of wastewater within the watershed given the high threat of PFAS and other toxic contamination. The wastewater produced by fracking contains the chemicals used in drilling and fracking fluids. It is almost certain that PFAS substances may be in the wastewater produced by fracked wells. PennFuture will continue to push DRBC - and others - to fully protect our waters, lands, and communities from the dangers of fracking in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Finally, there is currently legislation being drafted and proposed in response to the Pennsylvania Attorney Generals Grand Jury report on fracking. Bills have been introduced already that aim to increase setback requirements and give our Attorney General more enforcement power. We anticipate that such legislation will also include a chemical disclosure requirement, as recommended by the Grand Jury, and we hope that the General Assembly will also consider banning fracking companies from using these toxic forever chemicals in the fracking process.</p><p>Please see the following, <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/bi/BillIndx.cfm?sYear=2021&sIndex=0&bod=S"">Senate Bills 650-657 for further information.</a></p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Austin Grace, Legal Intern"
Supreme Court Ruled Natural Gas Companies Can Condemn State-Owned Land,7/15/2021,"<p>The U.S. Supreme Court recently dealt a severe blow <a href=""https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/land-environment/2021/07/04/penneast-pipeline-supreme-court-decision-opponents/7819506002/"">in an ongoing fight to prevent PennEast</a>, a private natural gas company, from building a 116 mile natural gas pipeline from the Marcellus Shale region in Pennsylvania into New Jersey.</p><p>The proposed pipeline is planned to start in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, and end in Mercer County, New Jersey. In a divided 5-4 opinion, the Court overturned the 3rd Circuit's decision <a href=""https://ballotpedia.org/PennEast_Pipeline_Co._v._New_Jersey"">and held that PennEast has the authority</a> to condemn land owned by the State of New Jersey for the purposes of building the pipeline under the Natural Gas Act.</p><p>The authority derives from a certificate issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to PennEast essentially certifying that the construction of the pipeline is a public convenience and necessity. Section 717f(h) of the Natural Gas Act <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/717f"">authorizes holders of this FERC certificate to exercise the power</a> of federal eminent domain to condemn any private or State owned right-of-way required to build the ""necessary"" pipelines if they cannot secure the right-of-way through contract and negotiated compensation.</p><p>The issues argued in the 3rd Circuit and the Supreme Court turned on complicated constitutional questions of state sovereign immunity. According to the Supreme Court, condemnation proceedings by PennEast against New Jersey do not violate state sovereign immunity because the states consented to federal eminent domain power (including condemnation proceedings) when they ratified the Constitution, and long established precedent allows the Federal Government to delegate this power to private parties. In reaching this decision, Chief Justice Roberts references the ""humble beginnings"" of the Nation's interstate pipeline system in central Indiana, and its development into a system spanning hundreds of thousands of miles thanks to Section 717f(h) of the Natural Gas Act.</p><p>PennEast seeks to condemn 131 properties in New Jersey. The state of New Jersey has an ownership interest in forty-two of these properties, including many which are preserved for open space, conservation, or farmland. Additionally, the pipeline is planned to cross <a href=""https://www.njspotlight.com/2021/06/us-supreme-court-ruling-controversial-penneast-pipeline-state-of-nj-environmentalists-disappointed/"">at least 31 streams designated as ""Category One""</a> by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection that meet drinking water needs and provide critical habitat to wildlife.</p><p>Habitat and clean drinking water degradation aside, the $1 billion dollar investment is a step backwards in achieving the country's goal <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/"">of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050</a>. Stranger still, a financial supporter of the PennEast pipeline, South Jersey Industries (SJI), <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/penneast-pipeline-south-jersey-industries-emissions-20210519.html"">has recently announced that it plans</a> to be carbon neutral by 2040. Realistically speaking, the global consensus on the threat of climate change and the strengthened focus on renewable, clean energy is influencing future energy markets and demand. No amount of job creation or greenwashing by its financial backers will change the fact that the PennEast pipeline will be competing in a market faced with a decreasing demand for natural gas.</p><p>In an effort to continue to move forward at all costs, PennEast decided to <a href=""https://penneastpipeline.com/penneast-files-new-phased-approach-with-federal-regulators-to-meet-growing-customer-demand/"">break the pipeline project into two phases</a> after regulatory and legal delays so that it could begin building in the areas where it has already gained approval, despite the fact that a number of permits and approvals are still outstanding. Phase 1 would be 68 miles and begin from the Marcellus Shale region in Pennsylvania into Bethlehem Township. Phase 2 would continue through Bucks County and across the Delaware River ending in Mercer County, New Jersey. PennFuture <a href=""/Files/Admin/PennEast-Chs.-102---105-Comments-Jan.-2021-.pdf"">has previously argued</a> that PennEast, especially in this new phased approach, is a pipeline to nowhere, and that allowing for the construction of the pipeline at this time would result in permanent and unnecessary degradation of our lands and waters.</p><p>However, the fight is not over yet. Resistance against the pipeline's construction has been on-going for seven years and there is still pending litigation. There are challenges related to FERC's issuance of the certificate of public necessity that were stayed while the Supreme Court evaluated the case, and they will resume now. PennEast also needs to obtain several permits from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Delaware River Basin Commission, and both the Pennsylvania and New Jersey DEPs to go forward with the project. The Pennsylvania DEP <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/ProgramIntegration/Pennsylvania-Pipeline-Portal/Pages/PennEast.aspx"">provides information on the pipeline status</a> in Pennsylvania, including all of the application and permit materials and information on past and upcoming public hearings.</p><p>The DEP has not yet approved the required Chapter 102 (Erosion and Sediment Control) and Chapter 105 (Dam Safety and Waterway Management) permits for the Phase 1 portion of the proposed pipeline, and we continue to oppose this destructive and unnecessary pipeline in PA.

"Report highlights success of Philadelphia’s Green City, Clean Waters Program",7/13/2021,"<p>Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is approaching a major milestone in Philadelphia. This year marks 10 years since the City of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Water Department embarked on its groundbreaking effort to improve water quality through the implementation of GSI with its Green City, Clean Waters program.</p><p>A recent report <a href=""https://www.sbnphiladelphia.org/recent_coverage/sbn-releases-report-on-ten-years-of-gsis-impact-in-pa-and-why-its-a-crucial-tool-for-economic-recovery-and-growth/"">from our partners at Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia (SBN)</a> confirms that the city's original vision for cleaner water in Philadelphia has been hugely successful and the continued development of the GSI industry across Pennsylvania can serve as a driver of positive economic, social, and environmental change. At a time when Pennsylvania's coffers are flush with revenue, the SBN report makes a compelling case for increased support for greener watershed stormwater management from Harrisburg.</p><p>Let's face it: there is a great deal of uncertainty at the moment. For the second time in 15 years, we experienced a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" economic catastrophe. The global pandemic responsible for this catastrophe has now claimed four million lives worldwide. Simultaneously, Americans are grappling with centuries of racial injustice and the increasingly worrisome impact of climate change. As the report says: ""While the combination of these crises can feel overwhelming, they also present a unique opportunity to recognize their interdependence and embrace a holistic approach to problem-solving.""</p><p>Increased investment in green space through GSI will allow Pennsylvania to create jobs, address historical inequities in our Black and Brown communities, and help all Pennsylvanians better deal with the ramifications from a climate that is growing hotter and wetter. GSI utilizes nature-based solutions like rain gardens, green roofs, and tree trenches, to manage polluted stormwater runoff. It is a cleaner and cheaper method to ensure that we have cleaner water while also providing significant benefits to the surrounding communities.</p><p>According to the SBN report, there are currently 34,000 GSI workers in Pennsylvania. From 2011 to 2019, Pennsylvania's GSI industry grew at a staggering rate of 9.2 percent. Pennsylvania saw 6.3 percent growth across all occupations statewide during that time. Philadelphia, alone, has seen its local GSI industry grow by 13.3 percent, adding 1,200 jobs from 2011-2019. The report also makes clear that these are life-sustaining jobs for all Pennsylvanians regardless of educational background or access to professional training:</p><ol><li>Onein twoGSI industry workers earn more than $15/hour.</li><li>The median annual wage for a high school graduate is $47,120.</li><li>More than half of GSI jobs require a high school diploma or less.</li><li>More than 40 percent of jobs pay more than $55,000 per year.</li></ol><p>Jobs in the GSI industry provide a legitimate pathway to life-sustaining careers for Pennsylvanians who are most in need of viable solutions to support themselves and their families. Most importantly, these jobs are readily available to the local communities where projects are implemented. In Philadelphia, the Green City, Clean Waters plan is estimated to support 1,160 jobs per year in a city that consistently struggles with high unemployment in Black and Brown neighborhoods due to historic exclusion from equitable opportunities in education and professional training. Emphasizing workforce development, diversity, and inclusion within the GSI industry will help provide equitable economic opportunity to these communities.</p><p>These same communities have also suffered the effects of historically racist practices like redlining. Beginning in the 1930s, redlining was a practice developed by the federal government and financial industry to promote investment and development in areas that were largely white while simultaneously disinvesting in communities of color. The impact from this practice is still being felt today. Research has confirmed that <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/30/opinion/environmental-inequity-trees-critical-infrastructure.html"">the lack of green space in communities of color directly correlates</a> to redlining and has contributed to the urban heat island effect in cities like Philadelphia.</p><p>The urban heat island effect leads to hotter temperatures in urban areas with less access to green space. Fortunately, we have a natural resource to help reduce temperatures: trees. Trees <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/climate/trees-cities-heat-waves.html"">substantially reduce air temperatures</a> in city neighborhoods and improve air quality. As the SBN report details, 70 percent of low-income communities live in nature-deprived areas and are more vulnerable to extreme heat. People of color are three times more likely to live in a nature-deprived area. Investing in GSI will add green space in these areas and help reverse the heat island effect and the racist practices that allowed it to develop over time.</p><p>The best part about investing heavily in GSI is that we know that investing in infrastructure is a proven method to help the economy recover from a severe recession. According to the report, every dollar invested in infrastructure during the recovery from the Great Recession resulted in a 1.5x return in GDP growth. The report states: ""Because infrastructure projects often last three years, they are an effective strategy to mitigate economic fallout in the short term. In addition, because planning and design, construction, and ongoing operations and maintenance are key elements of successful GSI projects, investments in GSI also position the Commonwealth for long-term economic benefits.""</p><p>Despite the economic, social, and environmental benefits provided by GSI and the desperate need to upgrade and repair Pennsylvania's aging stormwater management infrastructure, there is a significant funding gap to make the necessary upgrades and repairs to meet regulatory requirements. SBN notes that available funding over the next 10 years amounts to $900 million. Pennsylvania needs an additional $8.4 billion to fund the work that must be done to update its stormwater management infrastructure.</p><p>Here is what we know:</p><ol><li>Pennsylvania's stormwater management infrastructure is in dire need of upgrade and repair.</li><li>Pennsylvania's economy requires significant investment to ensure a robust and equitable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related recession.</li><li>The world is growing hotter and wetter due to climate change, which increases our need to protect our waterways from polluted runoff.</li><li>To paraphrase <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/5C41iVpK8HXCe3qlLL3I38"">a Pennsylvania native</a>, we need trees to come back stronger than a '90s trend to help us reduce temperatures.</li><li>Pennsylvania is one of the leaders in GSI industry and can do more to ensure we keep leading in this critical field.</li></ol><p>Here are recommendations from the SBN report for the Pennsylvania General Assembly to promote investment in GSI:</p><ol><li>Restore funding for PA Act 167 and otherwise fund municipal stormwater management planning and implementation.</li><li>Increase funding through Clean Water State Revolving Fund grants and other low- to no-cost financing for public GSI projects, with guidelines that prioritize nature-based solutions and investments in vulnerable and underserved communities.</li><li>Expand grants, low- to no-cost financing, and other incentives to promote GSI investments on private property.</li></ol><p>The model for success with GSI has been proven in Philadelphia and across the Commonwealth. The time is now to fully fund this critical component of Pennsylvania's cleaner and greener future.</p><p>View the full SBN <a href=""https://www.sbnphiladelphia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GSI_A-Tool-for-Economic-Recovery-and-Growth-in-PA_doubleview.pdf"">report here.</a></p>",Climate; Community; Environment,"Adam Nagel, Campaign Manager"
"More than Skin-Deep: Environmental Racism, Justice, and Pennsylvania",7/7/2021,"<p>We are a year out from the wave of protests, marches, sit-ins, phone and text banking, and multifaceted advocacy that shaped the Summer 2020. People began to question whole systems, political, social, and economic alike: why did, in the Land of Opportunity, the poor become poorer, the rich richer; Black and brown people keep dying from situations others individuals would not? Are there links between race and class, does the white, Black, and brown working class have more in common than meets the eye, and what does this mean for environmental advocacy?</p><p>Article 1, Section 27 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania states that ""[t]he people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvanias public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come."" Yet, the conditions on the ground show that not all groups have the same access to clean air or pure water.</p><p>Environmental Racism as a concept has its roots in the 1970s and 1980s, but its earliest usage as a term was by pastor and Civil Rights champion Dr. Benjamin Chavis. Dr. Chavis defined ""environmental racism"" as <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/what-is-environmental-racism-pollution-covid-systemic/"">""racial discrimination in environmental policy-making</a>, the enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of colour for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities, and the history of excluding people of colour from leadership of the ecology movements.""</p><p><a href=""https://qz.com/1226984/environmental-racism-has-left-black-americans-three-times-more-likely-to-die-from-pollution/"">Nationwide</a>, Black Americans are <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1702747"">three times more likely to die</a> from exposure to air pollutants than their white counterparts. <a href=""https://www.colorlines.com/articles/study-pennsylvanias-communities-color-more-danger-health-consequences-fracking"">In Pennsylvania specifically</a>, people of color are 39 percent of the population living within three miles of existing and proposed air polluting coal and fossil fuel power plants, while only composing 22 percent of Pennsylvania's total population. In addition, the poverty rate is 60 percent higher within three miles of the plants compared to the rest of the state. It is clear that people of minority groups are facing the brunt of environmental degradation at a harsher rate than other groups.</p><p>Looking at a more local level, specifically in Western Pennsylvania, the race and ethnic disparities in access to clean air and water persist. In Allegheny County, <a href=""https://www.ehn.org/environmental-injustice-pittsburgh-air-pollution-2646169635.html"">Environmental Health News</a> and the <a href=""https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-020-00584-z""><em>Environmental Health</em></a> journal show <a href=""https://www.ehn.org/pittsburgh-air-pollution-unsafe-2644931105.html"">air pollution levels vary widely</a> between neighborhoods, with the County regions most polluted census tracts being found in poor and minority neighborhoods, while the census tracts with the cleanest air tend to be in wealthier and whiter neighborhoods. The same data also showed higher rates of air pollution-related deaths from coronary heart disease in poor and minority neighborhoods. The story is the same <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/new-report-finds-lead-in-majority-of-allegheny-county-water-systems-offers-strategies-to-reduce-exposure/Content?oid=19373592"">when it comes to water</a> in the County. Higher levels of lead exposure also correlated with rates of poverty of non-white populations.</p><p>The Pittsburgh City Paper highlights the <a href=""https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Environmental%20Health/2018%20Childhood%20Lead%20Surveillance%20Annual%20Report.pdf"">Pennsylvania Department of Health's 2018 Childhood Lead Surveillance Annual Report</a> that found that non-Hispanic Black children and Hispanic children were 3.8 times more likely to have confirmed elevated lead blood levels relative to their non-Hispanic white counterparts in Allegheny County. And these same trends of disproportionate pollution burdens being heaped on poorer communities and communities of color <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/09/24/JAMA-Network-Open-UPMC-study-air-pollution-pm25-particulates-linked-strokes-Afib-heart/stories/202009230137"">extends throughout Pennsylvania</a>. This is indeed Environmental Racism in action: poorer, darker folks are left to suffer the worst that bad environmental policy has to offer.</p><p>Is it simply that Black and brown populations face the brunt of environmental degradation due to race alone? Many, including myself, would say no -- income and class plays a role that impacts some white populations and further compounds the weight of the effects on those of minority races and ethnicities.</p><p>As defined by the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/learn-about-environmental-justice"">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>, Environmental Justice (EJ) is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies.</p><p>The reality is, however, that Pennsylvania's heavily white, rural, lower-income communities are, too, facing harsh impacts from environmental degradation, specifically by the fracked gas industry. Fracking wells in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale region <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/poor-communities-bear-greatest-burden-from-fracking/"">are disproportionately located in poor rural communities</a>, which bear much of the weight of associated pollution. Heavily-fracked communities <a href=""https://www.ehn.org/fracking-pennsylvania-deaths-2646154025.html"">face higher rates of numerous health effects</a> including preterm births, high-risk pregnancies, asthma, and cardiovascular disease, with Western PA's own Washington County facing the highest number of direct deaths from fracking-based air pollution in the entire Commonwealth.</p><p>Nevertheless, some policymakers in Pennsylvania have been welcoming the industry with open arms and open pocketbooks in the form of tax subsidies (<a href=""/Publication-Buried-Out-of-Sight-Uncovering-Pennsylvanias-Hidden-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies"">see PennFuture's latest report</a>). State legislators know of the <a href=""https://www.alleghenyfront.org/petrochemical-town-hall-near-pittsburgh-spotlights-pollution-health-worries/"">harmful effects that this industry brings</a> to the air and water quality of their own constituents, yet <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2021/04/22/the-house-environment-committee-chair-dismisses-climate-science-what-does-that-mean-for-climate-action-in-pa/"">continue to ignore calls to stop working</a> with this harmful and dying industry and lie directly to the very people who elected them.</p><p>Moving forward, we should highlight the work of people who live in our state fighting towards a more equitable approach to environmental justice. We need to actively and loudly push back on policymakers deliberately standing in the way of progress on the environmental equity front. We need to continue to educate our friends and neighbors on a better energy and labor alternative to fracking, petrochemical, and other environmentally degrading industries. We should lend an open ear to green job makers nationwide and even internationally, and <a href=""https://reimagineappalachia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ReImagine-Appalachia_PeriBrief_PA_Jan2021.pdf"">prioritize family-sustaining, green jobs</a> over dirty and dying industries.</p><p>Environmental Racism is, indeed, more than skin-deep, as income and class clearly further heighten the impact. Fighting Environmental Racism is integral to the larger idea of Environmental Justice. The problems being faced by our largely-white, rural neighbors are not that much different than that of a Black family in the City of Pittsburgh. Both are being taken advantage of by petrochemical and other dirty manufacturing corporate neighbors that are doing anything but being ""neighborly."" It is through unity and solidarity between the workers, I believe, that we will be able to breathe free, drink free, and live free.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"John Ukenye, Policy Analyst"
"Instead of Taxing Electric Vehicles, Pennsylvania Should Focus on Growing the Industry",7/6/2021,"<p>Pennsylvania has a reputation for the poor condition of our roads and bridges.In fact, when the American Society of Civil Engineers released their <a href=""https://infrastructurereportcard.org/state-item/pennsylvania/"">2018 Infrastructure Report Card</a>, it noted that because of the 2,600 transportation projects made possible with Act 89 funding, our grade for roads improved to a D+. Hardly a ringing endorsement, and our bridges had the same low score as well.</p><p>Just keeping the status quo will take larger and larger investments in infrastructure-improving conditions will cost even more-and our funding model is strained.<a href=""https://www.penndot.gov/about-us/funding/Pages/default.aspx"">According to PennDOT</a>, 74% of infrastructure funding comes from gas taxes, 17% comes from vehicle fees, and 9% comes from the general fund, but current revenue still leaves us billions of dollars short of meeting our needs. Worse yet, the heavy reliance on gas taxes has some significant structural problems.</p><p>On the surface, having people pay for the infrastructure in proportion to their use sounds like a fair arrangement, but with vehicles becoming more efficient and more automakers announcing plans to phase out fossil fuels entirely, gas purchases are an increasingly poor indicator of road usage, and relying on gas taxes simply isn't sustainable.This has put alternatives like electric vehicles (EVs) <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063734865"">in the sights of many policy makers.</a></p><p>Governor Wolf appears to be taking a more methodical approach, creating a <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-commits-to-phasing-out-gas-tax-announces-commission-to-develop-funding-solutions/"">Transportation Revenue Options Commission</a> to make funding recommendations.Other lawmakers aren't stopping to consider the alternatives and are proposing EV owners pay high-and sometimes punitive-fees.</p><p><u>Fairness and equity is a challenging problem</u></p><p>In reality, being fair is a complicated problem that goes beyond EVs, and just charging EV owners high fees isn't the solution. The assumption that more gas purchases equates to more vehicle miles of travel (VMT) may seem fair on the surface, but it has its own problems.Fuel economy for new vehicles <a href=""https://www.bts.gov/content/average-fuel-efficiency-us-passenger-cars-and-light-trucks"">has been steadily increasing</a> long before hybrids and EVs became available.That means when someone buys a new car, there is a good chance they will be buying less gas and paying less tax per mile than the person who ends up driving the vehicle they traded-in.</p><p>This, along with many other factors such as the increasing distance between affordable housing and jobs, creates a system in the United States where, <a href=""https://www.itdp.org/2019/05/23/high-cost-transportation-united-states/#:~:text=The%20lowest%20income%20is%20burdened,(lack%20of)%20transport%20system."">unlike much of Europe</a>, the lower your income bracket the higher percentage of your income you will spend on transportation. As the author James Baldwin once noted, ""anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.""</p><p>Although regressive taxes like our gas tax create significant equity issues, the ability of many drivers to give themself a tax cut by buying a more efficient car, carpooling, or otherwise driving less is a real benefit.Economists say <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-5/using-gasoline-data-to-explain-inelasticity.htm"">gas prices are relatively inelastic</a> and people don't change their behavior all that much until gas prices get very high, but people still like having the power to choose.</p><p>There is another less obvious benefit from at-the-pump taxes: we likely receive a significant amount of tax dollars every year from out-of-state drivers who stop and fill their tanks in Pennsylvania. For interstate trucking we have a system called the <a href=""https://www.revenue.pa.gov/FormsandPublications/FormsforBusinesses/MAFT/MCRT-IFTA/Documents/dmf-105.pdf"">International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA)</a> that attempts to more fairly apportion tax dollars based on where the vehicles are used instead of where the fuel is purchased, but there is no equivalent for personal vehicles. If we don't get the revenue out-of-state drivers are paying in gas taxes, we'll need to backfill that with additional revenue from other sources. It should be no surprise that most lawmakers would rather a tax be paid by non-resident drivers than their constituents.</p><p><u>Fairly Addressing the EV issue</u></p><p>Pennsylvania already attempted to address the issue of EVs not contributing to road use.Our current law includes an <a href=""https://www.revenue.pa.gov/TaxLawPoliciesBulletinsNotices/TaxBulletins/MAFT/Documents/mft_bulletin_2012-01.pdf"">Alternative Fuels Tax (AFT)</a> for vehicles that don't run on gas or diesel. The tax rate depends on the power source of the vehicle-for EVs it's currently $0.0172 per kilowatt-hour. That works out to $0.5744 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE). Very close to the 2021 liquid fuels tax of $0.576 per gallon of gas.</p><p>This isn't a perfect solution since someone with a hybrid, or any car with better than average gas mileage, will still pay less per mile than someone driving an older, less efficient vehicle. Businesses will also pay more in net taxes per mile on electric vehicles since they are charged 6% sales tax on the electricity that isn't charged on gasoline or diesel fuel. But, there is a larger problem with this system: relatively few people file the required reports and actually pay the tax. A more systematic approach to collecting the tax is possible, but any proposal to do this is going to create new expenses in recordkeeping, managing data, and of course enforcement.</p><p>As an alternative, we could skip a lot of recordkeeping and data management by charging EV owners a flat fee, but this raises the question of what amount is fair. It's easy to calculate that a new car driving around 10,000 miles per year at an average of 37mpg will generate about $155 in gas taxes, but does that make charging all new EV owners a fee of $155 fair? A flat fee like this means that the proverbial grandma who only drives to church on Sunday would be paying the same as someone with an hour-long commute every day. We'd also be missing out on fees from out-of-state drivers entirely.</p><p>Fairness should also consider more than just who is paying for roads.Driving an EV 10,000 miles per year in Pennsylvania could save around three tons of carbon pollution, along with cutting emissions of air toxics and smog-causing volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen. The economic value of <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-12/documents/social_cost_of_carbon_fact_sheet.pdf"">cutting carbon pollution and other emissions</a> could easily exceed the otherwise ""fair"" $155 fee.Of course, we need to get revenue from somewhere if we are going to maintain our roads and bridges-for now, actually charging polluters for the cost of their pollution would be a good start.</p><p>Even if we ultimately conclude EVs drivers are going to need to pay more at some point, there is no particular rush to tax them today. EVs only represented about <a href=""https://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/DVSPubsForms/BMV/Registration%20Reports/ReportofRegistrations2020.pdf"">one tenth of one percent of the vehicles registered</a> in Pennsylvania in 2020, and these are mostly smaller and lighter vehicles, so the impact on our roads and the actual lost revenue is comparatively small.</p><p>Granted, the number of EVs <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/StateEnergyProgram/PAEVRoadmap.pdf"">is expected to grow substantially in the coming years</a>, but that brings additional opportunities for economic growth in sustainable industries that we should be encouraging. Utilities and electrical workers improving our distribution network and expanding charging stations will be an important sector, but parts, maintenance, and supporting technologies for the new vehicles will bring opportunities as well.</p><p>When computers and the Internet were relatively new, Pennsylvania offered tax moratoriums to help sales grow. With that growth in sales, businesses specializing in technology grew as well and they are now <a href=""https://www.workstats.dli.pa.gov/Documents/PA%20Industry%20Clusters/BSV%204-Pager.pdf"">a key part of our business services industry.</a>EV and EV service industries could be the next success story in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Rather than taxing EVs, hindering a promising developing industry, maybe we should focus on growing sustainable industries first.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
Show Your Support for Our Delaware River Fish Protection Petition!,7/1/2021,"<p>Earlier this year, PennFuture and our partners submitted <a href=""/Files/Admin/PR_DRBC.Petition_3.3.2021.pdf"">a supplemental petition</a> to the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) seeking immediate upgrade of the designated use of a portion of the mainstem Delaware River to protect fish and aquatic life, especially Atlantic sturgeon. The purpose of the Delaware River Fish Protection Petition is to upgrade the designated uses of Zone 3, Zone 4, and a portion of Zone 5 of the Delaware River to include and protect the existing aquatic life uses.</p><p>Based on the evidence, the current existing use is the ""maintenance and propagation of resident fish and other aquatic life"" and ""spawning and nursery habitat for migratory fish."" These are technical terms under the applicable clean water regulations that recognize and require a certain higher level of water quality to protect these uses.</p><p>The federal Clean Water Act states that the designated use should match the existing vuse. Designated uses describe the attainable condition and are regulations promulgated through a rulemaking process. Existing uses describe the current condition of a water body. If designated use does not match the current existing use in the Delaware River, it could lead to harm to aquatic life and the surrounding communities. (For a bit more on designated and existing uses in Pennsylvania, <a href=""https://youtu.be/DBWr4aFUvgM"">check out this Our Pocono Waters video.</a>) For additional background on the history of dissolved oxygen in the urban stretches of the Delaware River and the legal requirements surrounding designated uses in the River, please take a look at this webinar.</p><p>In 2013, Delaware River Keeper Network and other associations submitted an initial petition to the DRBC, urging it to recognize the emerging data that fish are now spawning in all zones of the Delaware Estuary. The Delaware River's genetically unique population of Atlantic sturgeon is also on the brink of extinction. Every summer, there is a decrease in dissolved oxygen levels, leading to reproductive failures for the fish in the river and will lead to extinction <a href=""https://www.nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/Review_DOreq_KeySensSpecies_DelEstuary_ANStoDRBCnov2018.pdf"">as indicated by a 2018 DRBC report</a>.</p><p>Dissolved oxygen is the amount of oxygen that is present in the water and therefore available for fish. Oxygen dissolves by diffusion from the surrounding air; aeration of water that has tumbled over falls and rapids; and as a waste product of photosynthesis. Fish and aquatic animals cannot split oxygen from water or other oxygen-containing compounds, making dissolved oxygen vital for their survival. Furthermore, there was a decrease in dissolved oxygen as indicated by both the Chester and Ben Franklin sensor, showing a lack of updated protections to prevent backsliding and lethal conditions from occurring in the Delaware River.</p><p>Accomplishing the upgrade of the designated use to match the existing use will provide incredible economic benefits that potentially exceed $1 billion and improve the surrounding communities. In a recent study, the restoration of dissolved oxygen in the Delaware River <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/DRN Keylog - Economic Value of DO Restoration in the DE %282020-12%29.pdf"">was modeled to predict water quality</a> and ecological improvements that directly and indirectly benefit the region's economy.</p><p>Even though many of the recognized benefits could not be translated to economic valuation, it forecasted benefits ranging from $40 million to $60 million annually, and total benefits approaching $1 billion for local economies. Next, poorer communities around the Delaware River will enjoy better water quality after having to endure degraded water quality and failure of the basic implementation of Clean Water Act protections on the tidal river. Other examples of observed improvements are the return of recreational watersports; and both the restoration of striped bass and American shad fisheries around the river.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about these economic benefits, <a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__youtu.be_y-2DgmhZSnwYk&d=DwQGAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=J7VSoqYCG5L5ntGWm-Av1zYjsSNjNMFGZWrVV4FWpr0&m=wj6lma6kO4MNOCz7aVHPgFZnGPvMKeKAarJ9qbA4Tuc&s=NU4mTf3q43NLXb2D_IJmKmTLecch8ioZVjK85fM2LSY&e="">this webinar focuses on the recent economic study</a> and details regarding potential economic benefits.</p><p>We are excited about this opportunity to protect the fish of the Delaware, improve the water quality protections in and around Philadelphia, and ensure that the existing uses for the entire Delaware River mainstem are protected.But we need your help!</p><p>Please join us and <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/sign-delaware-river-fish-protection-petition"">sign the letter in support</a> of the Delaware River Fish Protection Petition.</p>",Community; Environment,"Austin Grace, Legal Intern"
Introducing PennFuture's Legal Interns,6/30/2021,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania's environment and ""create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.""</p><p>Over the past 20 years, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p><p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognized that we need to be more involved with cultivating the legal talent that will continue to support our mission. Our attorneys have a long history of mentoring legal interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.</p><p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor law students interested in making a difference for our environment.</p><p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting the State as well as to further their potential careers in environmental law. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.</p><p>This summer, we have a fantastic group of law students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We've asked our summer legal interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture's mission means to them:</p><p><u><strong>Emily Rollins is a rising third-year law student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.</strong></u></p><p>I decided to go to law school because I wanted to pursue environmental law.

During my time at LGNC, I saw first hand the devastation that the New Jersey Zinc Company caused to its mountains and rivers when they were in operation in the 1900's. To this very day, LGNC is still making effortsto restore the area. Working on the mountain sides at LGNC ignited a passion in me to protect species and the water quality. After completion of the project, I decided to set my sights on law school so I can pursue a career advocating for the environment.</p><div><p>After my first year of law school, I worked as an intern for the Department of Environmental Protection at the Harrisburg Office remotely. I enjoyed my work with them and wanted to pursue further work with other legal departments. I then learned more about PennFuture from past interns that worked there and realized that this would line up with my passions on protecting water quality, other species, even air quality throughout Pennsylvania.

Will Pennsylvania’s Environment Ever Be A Priority for the Legislature?,6/29/2021,"<p>Probably no profession requires taking the long view as does that of the environmental advocate. That's probably why I'm so fond of the proverb, ""Hope springs eternal."" It reminds me of the aspect of human nature that will always seek out cause for optimism, and I hold onto it because of that possibility. </p><p>Holding onto optimism feels a little challenging these days. Last week, the state budget that PennFuture so optimistically saw as a chance for lawmakers and the Governor to invest in a greener future, fell far short of making those investments, and the support for clean water we were hoping to see never materialized. Yes, the budget came through in important ways. The Governor and the legislature agreed to their funding priorities, none of them environmental. And perhaps, no surprise, fossil fuels made it to their list.</p><p>This budget cycle again boosted fracking, and petrochemicals like fertilizer and plastics. We've bellyached a lot in this blog about the largesse the legislature has shown the petrochemical industry through subsidies and other tax giveaways, and PennFuture has documented this serious problem most recently in <a href=""/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">the third edition of our Fossil Fuel subsidy report.</a> When it passed <a href=""/News-PennFuture-responds-to-passage-of-House-Bill-732"">House Bill 732 (Act 66) last summer</a>, state government set up $6.67 million in annual tax credits for up to four facilities that will use dry gas to produce petrochemicals or fertilizers.</p><p>Less than one year later, using the tax code legislation that accompanied last week's approved state budget, the legislature reduced the number of facilities (from four facilities, to up to two facilities) that can qualify for the tax credits, but left the aggregate cap in place guaranteeing there will be unallocated credits. The legislation also stipulatedthat the Department of Revenue must give those unallocated credits to only one of the qualifying facilities.</p><p>Like so much else about Pennsylvania's opaque budget process, there was no transparency or forewarning that this move was afoot. It was presumably negotiated by the main budget players - Governor Wolf, Senate Majority Leader Kim Ward, Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, and Speaker of the House Bryan Cutler - and the closed-door process forces us to make these kinds of presumptions.What is verifiable is that the state budget and its accompanying tax and fiscal codes received a majority of votes and the Governor has signed the legislation.</p><p>We are also left to conjecture why the tax subsidy was re-structured so that a much larger piece of the subsidy pie will go to just onepetrochemical manufacturer.We are concluding that there is indeed a petrochemical interest waiting in the wings, looking to set up shop here in Pennsylvania, but they sought a much sweeter pie.Hence the legislature and Governor have structured a revised subsidy thats grown from over $6.6 million to at least $20 million eachyear for the next 24 yearsfor some lucky grand prize winner.The beneficiaries of these giveaways will in turn buy fracked gas, employ workers, and transform some lucky partof our magnificent state into a petrochemical industrial nightmare.</p><p>Some really great things could have been done with the budget this time around because state legislators and the Governor weren't constrained by revenue availability. They have in hand $7 billion in federal money to address Covid impacts including economic recovery and stimulus. Politicians didn't need to once again pick winners, and losers. But they did, and so lead in drinking water will go unaddressed, as will the thousands of miles of dead streams impacted by legacy pollution from coal, and they've also forgotten the agricultural producers under scrutiny to put more best management practices on their lands and along waterways to improve the health of the Susquehanna River. Instead, politicians decided to bank more than half of the funds, rather than investing in assets like cleaner water, or making Pennsylvania more competitive in the green economy.</p><p>PennFuture works very hard for good outcomes, often playing defense. But the anti-environmental and anti-democracy members of the state legislature are running the show. We are grateful for the times the Governor has used his veto to stop the most egregious measures the legislature comes up with.</p><p>PennFuture is taking some respite in an alternative pathway to meet our mission advocating for clean air and water, a healthy climate and green economy. It's a path that runs through Washington, not through Harrisburg. President Joe Biden is artfully trying to broker a bi-partisan infrastructure package. It seems separately, he's also attempting a complicated maneuver that may eventually get to investments that make us more climate resilient. But forgive me for being haunted by the ghost of 2013, when a sweeping cap and trade climate bill became a casualty of the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>Another interesting proverb I've pondered along the way is, ""Politics is the art of the possible."" Making a lot of people happy is a rarity in politics, so count me as an unhappy Pennsylvania environmental advocate for the moment. But to think that the half-baked budget this state just approved pushed the limits of what is politically possible is not something I can accept.</p><p>The lack of work done by our legislators in the budget process feels lazy at best, blatantly irresponsible at worst, lacking vision and optimism. Nor will I be able to accept any federal infrastructure package that comes to fruition, if it is devoid of green infrastructure that can help us finally deal with the climate crisis. But there is still time to work hard for, and possibly achieve, a hopeful outcome.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jacquelyn Bonomo, PennFuture President and CEO"
"The Chesapeake Bay is Improving, but Still a Long Road to 2025",6/25/2021,"<p>This week, the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) gave the Chesapeake Bay a C <a href=""https://ecoreportcard.org/site/assets/files/2452/2020-chesapeake-bay-watershed-report-card.pdf"">in their latest report card</a>. This is an improvement from last year's grade of C-.</p><p>UMCES assigns grades to numerous regions across the estuary and watershed. The Upper Bay, where Pennsylvania contributes 90 percent of the freshwater, received a grade of C, showing a health trend that is significantly improving. In Pennsylvania, the West Branch of the Susquehanna scored an A-, the Lower Susquehanna and Juniata watersheds received a B-, and the Middle Susquehanna a C+. </p><p>This year's report card has new social and economic indicators of watershed health, including stewardship, protected lands, walkability, and heat vulnerability. As the President for UMCES, Dr. Peter Goodwin, pointed out, ""Improvements in our environment go hand-in-hand with improvements in our communities, particularly those that are traditionally disadvantaged.""</p><p>The indicators showed varying results. The scores for dissolved oxygen and total nitrogen improved. However, chlorophyll a-a measure of algae-and total phosphorus scores declined, with a slight decrease in water clarity, benthic community (aquatic life living at the bottom and an important food source for the ecosystem) and aquatic grass scores.</p><p>The UMCES says that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of Chesapeake Bay are not yet known, except for a reduction in atmospheric nitrogen from reduced travel and commuting. Between March and May 2020m, routine water monitoring did not take place.</p><p>The good news is that long-term trends of the indicators are showing improvement,thus demonstrating that the efforts taken to improve the health of the stream that drains to the Chesapeake Bay are working.</p><p>Pennsylvania is required to reduce its load of pollution into the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers by 34 million pounds of nitrogen and 756,000 pounds of phosphorus by 2025.</p><p>Pennsylvania has long remained behind in meeting clean water goals to address the health of the Chesapeake Bay. That's why this April, PennFuture released a report that provides a legislative roadmap to fully meet our funding and policy needs.</p><p>Titled<a href=""/Files/Admin/Final-Chesapeake-report.pdf""> ""Underfunded and Polluted: Solutions to Fund Clean Water in Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake Bay Watershed,""</a> our report puts forth a legislative agenda that, if acted upon, would provide the technical assistance, agency support, and public investments needed to put Pennsylvania on the path toward meeting the Environmental Protection Agency's Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load, or the so-called ""pollution diet"" goals, by its 2025 end date.</p><p>Efforts to improve the Bay will benefit our local waterways here in Pennsylvania. The Susquehanna River watershed-including a portion in New York- contains over 49,000 miles of streams. There are more than 15,000 miles of polluted streams within Pennsylvania's portions of the Susquehanna and Potomac River Basins alone.</p><p><u><strong>What Were Watching in the General Assembly</strong></u></p><p>Pennsylvania's annual state budget must be passed by June 30th. PennFuture and our partners advocate for increases in funding for critical clean water programs at the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Department of Agriculture.</p><p>Right now, Pennsylvania is faced with a unique opportunity. The recent passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 provides the Commonwealth with $7 billion in federal funds. We believe that <a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2021/06/pennsylvania-should-invest-federal-covid-relief-funds-in-clean-water-projects-opinion.html"">a portion of the funding should be invested</a> to improve and protect our rivers and streams. The state is also facing a potential $3 billion projected budget surplus.</p><p>We are working to secure dedicated funding for clean water through programs such as the creation of a Clean Streams Fund as well as a reinvigorated Growing Greener III program. We're advocating that a portion of this money-at least $500 million-be invested in our water resources which in turn supports jobs, a vibrant recreation economy, and supplies our drinking water.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.trcp.org/2018/12/10/outdoor-recreation-ranks-pennsylvanias-economy/"">Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership</a> found that outdoor recreation in Pennsylvania contributes to over 390,000 jobs with a total value of $26.9 billion, including over $7 billion in federal, state, and local tax revenue.</p><p>Another bill we are tracking is the Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program, or ACAP, that is proposed to help farmers install conservation practices that improve and protect our rivers and streams. Senate Bill 465 would significantly improve the water quality impacted by nutrient pollution in Pennsylvania. Senate Bill 465:</p><ul><li>Expands upon the Conservation Excellence Grant Program, a program from the PA Farm Bill;</li><li>Provides flexibility and places decision-making power at the local level where counties and farmers can make decisions based on local need and benefit;</li><li>Can provide up to 100 percent of a project's cost, which can leverage other private and state and federal funding sources; and,</li><li>Allows County Conservation Districts, the State Conservation Commission, and Penn State or similar institutions to keep a small percentage of allocated funds for technical assistance and administrative costs.</li></ul><p>Another clean water bill we are tracking is SB 251. This is a lawn fertilizer bill that would reduce the excess nutrients that are impacting the health of our waterways. Over 2,600 miles of the Commonwealth's streams are impaired due to excess nutrients, which is the 5th leading cause. One source of excess nutrients comes from applying excess fertilizer. Passage of SB 251 will:</p><ul><li>Create a level playing field across the state and protect local waters. This bill will move towards one standard across the region, providing regional companies with similar market requirements to those in neighboring states</li><li>Limit how much nitrogen and phosphorus are applied to turf (grass) protecting our waterways from excess nutrients running off into our streams.</li><li>Establish a professional fertilizer applicator certification program, similar to pesticide applicators, to ensure that professionals apply fertilizers at the proper rates.</li><li>Develop an Agricultural and Homeowner Education Program to educate nonprofessional applicators on the proper rate of applying fertilizers.</li><li>Protect consumers through standardization of fertilizer composition and labels.</li></ul><p>The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science's recent report card is proof that investments in our waterways can make an impact. It's encouraging to see the health of the Bay improve and Pennsylvania's passing grades. The Commonwealth has the resources available and pending legislation to make significant investments in the health of our rivers and streams.</p><p>Our legislators have a choice to make-invest in our constitutional right to clean water or continue to see slow improvements to Pennsylvania's 25,000 miles of impaired streams. </p><p><a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/waterbudget"">Do your part today and click here to contact your elected officials.</a> Tell them to advocate for increased funding for clean water initiatives and programs, and to support efforts to improve the health of waterways across Pennsylvania.

Federal Court Dismissed Lawsuit Challenging DRBC’s Ban on Fracking,6/24/2021,"<p>We continue to bring you good news on the fracking front in the Delaware River Basin. In February 2021, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) took the <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fracking-Banned-in-Delaware-River-Basin"">monumental step in passing regulations</a> that ban the use of high volume hydraulic fracturing technology (""fracking"") to extract shale gas within the Delaware River Basin.</p><p>As predicted, a legal challenge was quickly filed challenging the DRBC's authority to ban fracking, spearheaded by PA State Senators Gene Yaw and Lisa Baker, the PA Senate Republican Caucus, and several municipalities. PennFuture, joined by partners, responded by submitting a <a href=""/News-Environmental-Groups-Law-Center-File-Friend-of-Court-Brief-in-Opposition-to-Challenge-to-Delaware-River-Basin-Commission-Fracking-Ban"">""friend of the court"" brief</a> which focused on the erroneous Environmental Rights Amendment claims made by the plaintiffs. (Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution recognizes a fundamental public right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment and to have the Commonwealth conserve and maintain public natural resources for the benefit of present and future generations.) Our brief supported the arguments of the DRBC and intervenors that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this lawsuit.</p><p>On June 11, 2021, the District Court for the Eastern District of PA <a href=""/Files/Admin/Opinion-on-Dismissing-Yaw-Suit.pdf"">agreed and dismissed the case</a> holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to file this case. Standing is the legal concept that ensures that a party has a ""dog in the fight"" - basically have they suffered the right kind of redressable injury to bring the lawsuit and ""stand"" before the court. Ultimately, Judge Paul S. Diamond concluded that this dispute ""is primarily partisan and is best resolved through the political process.""</p><p>In particular, Judge Diamond disagreed with the Senators' claims that state law vests them with sufficient interest to confer standing as does their claimed status as ""trustees"" under the Environmental Rights Amendment, calling these theories ""meritless."" The plaintiffs failed to show that the DRBC's actions harmed them: ""Although all plaintiffs argue vigorously that they have standing, they do not."" However, while foreclosed to the Senate plaintiffs, the court left open the possibility for the municipal plaintiffs to refile with strengthened allegations. The plaintiffs have 30 days to appeal this decision if they so choose.</p><p>The fact that DRBC's ban on fracking survived its first legal challenge is definitely cause for celebration! We have been waiting <a href=""/Blog-Item-Moratorium-on-Fracking-in-the-Delaware-River-Basin-is-Critical-to-Protect-Our-Water"">for over a decade for the DRBC's ban</a> to become permanent and we believe the final ban will withstand any challenges.</p><p>But challenges to DRBC's authority over fracking still remain. Not only could the municipal plaintiffs refile this case and the parties can also appeal the decision, but there is an outstanding 2016 lawsuit against DRBC filed by the Wayne Land and Mineral Group. That case challenges DRBC's authority under the Delaware River Basin Compact to regulate shale gas development in the Basin as a ""project."" The impact of both the finalization of the DRBC's fracking ban regulations and the recent decision in Yaw v. DRBC is still being considered.</p><p>Additionally, the DRBC withdrew its proposed regulations on transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of fracking wastewater within the Basin and its proposed regulations on allowing Delaware River Basin water to be exported outside of the basin to be used in fracking operations. PennFuture took issue with their <a href=""/Blog-Item-Public-Comment-Closes-on-DRBC-Fracking-Regulations"">first draft regulations</a> asking for them to be withdrawn because they were not protective of basin waters. The DRBC has until September 2021 to release new regulations on these matters.</p><p>PennFuture remains committed to protecting the Delaware River watershed from the harmful impacts of fracking and we will continue to engage on these matters.

Introduction: An Intersectional Approach to Fighting the Petrochemical Buildout in Pennsylvania,6/23/2021,"<p>Modern-day Pennsylvania was molded by the rapid technological advancements of the Industrial Revolution. The result of such advancements on human health, however, was devastating: these facilities required fossil fuels (whichinvolvean environmentally destructive process to extract in the first place) which directly led to poor air quality, poisoned water, and destroyed soil in the decades to follow. Pennsylvaniasresidents are still feeling the effects of this today.</p><p>Science and technology have long been on a path of creating better machines which are much more environmentally friendly. However, especially in western Pennsylvania where I am now based, petrochemical companies are stubbornly refusing to acknowledge the world changing around them. Petrochemical companies hold over the heads of their workers the threat of losing their livelihood if the companies are further pushed by ""environmentalists.""</p><p>This is why I joined the fight. I believe in the dignity of the human being, and thus, the dignity of the worker. Every citizen deserves not only a job, but a job that respects the air they breathe, water they drink, and land they live on. I aim to look at our work through this intersectional lens, as environmental issues (specifically the petrochemical and plastics issues) are directly correlated with every person's socioeconomic status, general health and wellbeing, and race, just to name a few.</p><p>My name is John Ukenye, and I am originally from South Florida, but am now based in Pittsburgh. Both sides of my family's story are immigrant ones, with my father's story in the United States beginning in Pittsburgh itself. After relocating to South Florida to continue his collegiate studies, hebrought me to western Pennsylvania throughout my childhood and I fell in love with its natural beauty and the friendly people that live here. I knew early in my life that I was called to this state and to lend whatever talents I cultivated to help. The environmental realm is one that reaches all Pennsylvanians, and sits at the center of all other issues every person in the state faces.</p><p>My first direct experience in the environmental space was during my time as a law clerk with the U.S. House of RepresentativesCommittee on Oversight and Reform, Subcommittee on Environment in Spring 2020, right beforeCOVID-19reached ""pandemic"" designation. One of the last issues I was working on was preparing for a series of hearings on plastic pollution and the over-extraction of water from regional aquifers. I did research on how plastic water bottle manufacturers capitalized on the corroded lead pipe situation in Flint, Michigan by selling and donating what was essentially their own local tap water back to the affected people in the region, now additionally wrapped in toxic plastic single-use packaging. This situation perfectly highlighted the intersection between the environment, the plastics industry, race, and class.</p><p>My goal, from the moment I knew I wanted to go to law school, was to promote equity and justice no matter where I ended up. I fought my way through my undergraduate education, finished in three years with two degrees, honors, and Phi Beta Kappa and was admitted to Washington University School of Law where I graduated roughly a year ago. I graduated into a world that was facing a pandemic and a civil rights and social justice reckoning simultaneously, where race and class issues became dinner table conversations across the country and the globe. Average, everyday people<a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intersectionality"">began to see the intersectionality</a> among EVERY issue, and these discussions continue on to this day. This is a perfect time as ever to view our work from a similar equity, justice, and intersectional perspective.</p><p>Our membership is no doubt plugged in to the environmental issues plaguing our world, country, state, and Appalachian region. While important to keep our supporters engaged, we must continue to actively reach out to those less informed about our area of work. It is those individuals who stand to be harmed the most by continued inaction on the environmental front.</p><p>These individuals include both rural western Pennsylvanians (as well as the rest of Appalachia), especially those who work in the dying fracked gas industry, and Black and brown families that live near petrochemical plants due to historic redlining and environmental racism. Both groups stand to gain from uniting against the fracked gas, petrochemical, and plastics industries. Both groups are in generally in the same socioeconomic class, and both generally face the same issues of dirty air, water, and land caused by the petrochemical industry and plastic pollution. It is this disproportionate burden of <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/OfficeofEnvironmentalJustice/pages/default.aspx"">harmful environmental and human health impacts</a> that environmental justice seeks to overcome.</p><p>Both groups include hardworking people trying to feed their families, and do not deserve to have their ability to provide for their families threatened by petrochemical companies that are simultaneously destroying their land, water, and air.</p><p>We must explicitly recognize this intersectionality in the work we do, highlight both their struggles and triumphs from local leaders in the environmental space, and work to do our part to encourage the creation of better-paying green jobs that respect workers rightsto breath, drink, and live freely.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"John Ukenye, Policy Analyst"
Biden Administration Working to Repeal Trump's 'Dirty Water Rule',6/17/2021,"<p>We bring to you another update in the decades-long saga of protecting ""waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) under the federal Clean Water Act, but this time it is a positive step toward renewing federal jurisdiction over some of our most critical streams and wetlands that were stripped of protection by the Trump Administration in 2020.</p><p>Since the United States Supreme Court's 2006 split decision in Rapanos v. United States, there has been uncertainty and litigation over what waterbodies classify as WOTUS and therefore will fall within the Clean Water Act's protections. PennFuture joined <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Opposes-Any-Repeal-of-the-Clean-Water-Rule"">over 50,000 Pennsylvanians in supporting the 2015 Clean Water Rule</a> that attempted to bring clarity to the definition of WOTUS. And we vigorously opposed <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Opposes-Any-Repeal-of-the-Clean-Water-Rule"">the Trump Administration's repeal</a> and <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Submits-Comments-Opposing-the-Dirty-Water-Rule-Engages-More-Than-1400-Citizens-to-Do-the-Same"">replacement of the Clean Water Rule</a> with the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule, more correctly known as the ""Dirty Water Rule."" Despite numerous legal challenges across the nation which lead to a patchwork of rules, as of March 2021, the Dirty Water Rule is in effect in all 50 states.</p><p>On June 9, 2021, however, the Biden administration <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/wotus/intention-revise-definition-waters-united-states"">formally began the process to repeal and replace</a> the Dirty Water Rule, which reduced the number of water bodies that would be protected by the Clean Water Act <a href=""https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/biden-moves-to-restore-clean-water-safeguards-ended-by-trump/ar-AAKSsNZ?ocid=BingNewsSearch"">by twenty-five percent</a> and was determined to have led to significant environmental degradation, with thousands of streams and hundreds of permits at jeopardy. Across the country, thousands of wetlands and waterways that maintain water quality and drinking water sources and protect nearby communities from flooding <a href=""https://www.southernenvironment.org/news-and-press/news-feed/biden-administration-announcement-leaves-crucial-waters-in-jeopardy"">have already been destroyed</a> as a result of the Dirty Water Rule.</p><p>The Dirty Water Rule excludes ephemeral waters (temporary water bodies that only occur after precipitation) and wetlands that are not physically connected to a navigable water body by a visible surface connection. The rule is not based on science and greatly benefited the oil and gas industry and developers by allowing them to fill in wetlands and streams without a permit. The reality is that wetlands are extremely important natural filters that protect waterbodies, whether they are visibly connected by a continuous surface connection or not. Ephemeral waters <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-03/documents/ephemeral_streams_report_final_508-kepner.pdf"">play crucial ecological and hydrological roles</a> in maintaining water quality and watershed function and health, and are particularly important in the southwestern states. The EPA's own data shows that ephemeral waters provide drinking water to 117 million Americans.</p><p>The new rule will aim to restore protections and establish a durable definition of protected waters. EPA's <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-army-announce-intent-revise-definition-wotus"">news release explained</a> that the new rule will be informed by Supreme Court precedent, lessons learned from current and previous regulations, and stakeholder engagement. Additionally, it will be guided by considerations to protect water resources and communities, science and the effects of climate change to national waters, and efforts for practical implementation in states and Tribal communities. The Dirty Water Rule, by contrast, <a href=""https://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/ea5d9a9b55cc319285256cbd005a472e/5939af1252ddadfb852584e10053d472/$FILE/WOTUS SAB Draft Commentary_10_16_19_.pdf"">was admonished by EPA's own science advisors</a> as being in conflict with established science and the objectives of the Clean Water Act.</p><p>And some of the impacts from the Dirty Water Rule are already being felt locally by threatening restoration efforts of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed because excluded waters feed into the Chesapeake Bay. The Choose Clean Water Coalition, a coalition of organizations that advocate for clean rivers and streams in the Chesapeake Bay region of which PennFuture is the PA State Lead, <a href=""https://www.choosecleanwater.org/news/2021/6/10/plans-to-repeal-dirty-water-rule-a-big-win-for-chesapeake-bay"">released a statement supporting the EPA's decision</a> to revise the current rule and also urge them to replace it with one that restores protections to waterways and wetlands.</p><p>Stakeholders are encouraged to share their input during the rulemaking process. <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/wotus/public-outreach-and-stakeholder-engagement-activities-forthcoming"">Information on opportunities for public engagement</a> are forthcoming and PennFuture intends to engage in this process to ensure full protections of our critical headwaters and wetlands. <a href=""/donate"">Become a PennFuture member today</a> to stay informed and get engaged!</p><p>More information on the Dirty Water Rule:</p><ul><li><a href=""/Blog-Item-New-Definition-of-Waters-of-the-United-States-Threatens-Clean-Water-Act-Protections"">PennFuture's blog post on the Dirty Water Rule</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=356380261631140&ref=watch_permalink"">Video presentation on the Dirty Water Rule</a></li></ul>",Climate; Community; Environment,"Emily Rollins, Legal Intern"
The Plastics Problem: More False Strategies: Statewide Preemption,6/15/2021,"<p>Regular readers of this blog will be familiar with the Pennsylvania Legislature's attempts to <a href=""/Blog-Item-Regulatory-Reforms-Would-Roll-Back-Environmental-and-Health-Protections"">stymie advances in environmental protection</a> and <a href=""/Blog-Item-Legislators-Continue-to-Stand-in-the-Way-of-Climate-Action"">efforts to deny the realities of climate change.</a></p><p>Our Legislature has been employing a new strategy when it comes to promoting plastics and petrochemicals, and it is just as problematic. That problematic strategy is known as ""preemption.""</p><p>Preemption is the legal concept that a higher-level governmental body can prevent or overrule the actions of lower-level governmental bodies. For example, the federal government can pass laws or regulations that stop a state from passing different laws on a specific issue , or that override laws previously passed by a state on an issue. Similarly, a state legislature can pass laws that stop or override municipalities in that state from enacting laws or override laws that the municipality has previously passed.</p><p>Preemption is not, in the abstract, necessarily a bad thing. There are reasons why a state might want to have a whole-of-state approach to a certain issue, rather than having piecemeal regulation by different municipalities across the state.</p><p>For example, the state may want to have - and indeed does have! - uniform rules on how drivers' licenses are issued because there is a reasonable interest in having statewide uniformity in requirements for testing and licensing procedures, rather than having each town or city design its own rules for allowing drivers on the roads.</p><p>Here, however, the Legislature is not trying to make uniform rules across the Commonwealth for safety reasons, or to lessen the burden on municipalities, or to benefit a statewide goal. Here, the legislature is trying to stop municipalities from taking environmentally-beneficial actions in order to protect the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries.</p><p>The first example is the Legislature's action to prevent municipalities from banning single-use plastic bags.</p><p>In June of 2019, the Pennsylvania Legislature passed a fiscal code amendment (SB712) that included, as an add-on provision unconnected to the rest of the fiscal code, a prohibition which states: the ""General Assembly or a local governmental body or agency may not enact a law, rule, regulation or ordinance imposing a tax on or relating to the use, disposition, sale, prohibition or restriction of single-use plastics, reusable plastics, auxiliary containers, wrappings, or polystyrene containers"" until a report on the economic and environmental impact of plastics on the Commonwealth was submitted.</p><p>This report was submitted in June 2020. Around that same time, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Legislature again used the fiscal code to effectively delay implementation of any current plastic bag bans at least until July 1, 2021, or six months after the COVID-19 state of emergency is lifted.</p><p>Why would the Legislature do this?In order to promote uniform plastics laws across the Commonwealth?This cannot be the case, because there are no other statewide plastics laws in Pennsylvania.In fact, the Legislature here is not acting to promote positive statewide regulation at all, but instead to promote the petrochemical industry.</p><p>The state's own report on ""The Economic Impacts of Regulation of Single Use Plastics"" is very clear: ""The regulation of single-use plastics could also have indirect implications for the prospective clustering of petrochemical manufacturing facilities in the state. Pennsylvania is the second-largest producer of natural gas in the U.S. and the state's capacity for natural gas production and proximity to major markets make it an attractive location for new petrochemical facilities...Industry representatives noted that single-use plastics regulation could make the state a less viable option for prospective petrochemical and plastics manufacturers:""<a href=""http://www.ifo.state.pa.us/download.cfm?file=Resources/Documents/Single-Use%20Plastics%20Report-2020_06.pdf"">Economic Impact Report at page 33, 35.</a></p><p>Municipalities, of course, <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/plastic-bag-preemption-suit-takes-aim-at-long-time-harrisburg-dealmaking-mechanism/"">have taken a different view.</a>Municipalities across the state have considered banning or otherwise regulating single-use plastics.The City of Philadelphia, Narbeth, and West Chester have passed ordinances doing so. Other municipalities, such as Ferguson Township in Centre County, the City of Bethlehem, and the City of Pittsburgh have actively considered doing so. These local government entities have pointed to <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/philadelphia-single-use-plastic-bag-ban-mark-squilla-20190620.html"">plastic bag litter in their borders and clogging their waterways</a> as reasons to pass these ordinances.</p><p>The second example is the Legislature's ongoing attempt to prevent municipalities from restricting the types of energy used in buildings.Again, why would the legislature do this?To promote a uniform energy policy across the state?No, it is clear that the Legislature wants to promote the use of fracked gas.</p><p>The legislature previously tried, through Act 13 in 2013, to specifically eliminate the ability of municipalities to regulate the development of oil and gas resources. The PA State Supreme Court <a href=""http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-127A-D-2012oajc.pdf"">struck down this provision</a> as a violation of the Environmental Rights Amendment of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p><p>The Legislature <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/an-energy-choice-bill-has-some-lawmakers-worried-local-government-could-lose-power/"">is currently trying to enact very similar legislation</a> targeted at utility services rather than gas development companies, but the effect would be the same, and by focusing only on utility services the proposed legislation <a href=""https://local-government.pasenategop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2021/05/Additional-Testimony-PENNFUTURE-Letter-to-PA-Senate-on-SB-275-May-7-2021.pdf"">would give preferential treatment</a> to the polluting gas industry.</p><p>In the City of Philadelphia, the Office of Sustainability <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/editorials/philadelphia-gas-works-pgw-public-utility-climate-change-lng-20210607.html"">is conducting a study</a> about how the gas utility, Philadelphia Gas Works, can transition away from being an entirely gas-driven utility, in line with Mayor Jim Kenneys commitment that Philadelphia will achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in alignment with the Paris Agreement.The Legislature's preemption attempt here would stop this work in Philadelphia in its tracks.</p><p>To be fair, the Pennsylvania Legislature is not alone in attempting to stop the municipalities in its state from making positive environmental changes. This is a strategy that national anti-regulatory groups are pushing to state legislatures nationwide to prevent local governments from taking the initiative to solve their own problems.</p><p>The real problem with this sort of preemption is that it doesn't solve any problems - it just puts up roadblocks to creating meaningful policy change.</p><p>The Legislature is not pushing solutions or enacting statewide policies; instead, it is just telling municipalities that they are prevented from the sort of creative problem solving that the American system of federalism is supposed to promote. When it comes to the problem of plastics, we need real solutions, not roadblocks.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jessica O'Neill, Senior Attorney"
"Coal-Fired Power Plant to Close Because of Market Conditions, Not Environmental Regulations",6/11/2021,"<p>On June 9, the owner of the Cheswick coal-fired power plant in Allegheny County, Houston-based GenOn Holdings LLC, announced that the plant <a href=""https://www.genon.com/genon-news/genon-holdings-llc-announces-retirement-of-three-coal-fired-power-plants"">would cease operations effective onSept. 15, 2021.</a></p><p>This was no surprise to industry-watchers and, despite the claims from polluters and their friends, this had little to do with environmental regulations. To be sure, Cheswick-one of the top emitters of toxic air pollutants in Allegheny County-is facing lawsuits for releasing hot water into the Allegheny River and for inappropriately turning off pollution control equipment, but even without these lawsuits, Cheswick was struggling.</p><p>Most of the energy we use in Pennsylvania is purchased at auctions run by our grid operator, PJM Interconnection. Generators that bid low enough to clear these auctions get called up to run and provide us power-in return they receive whatever the market-clearing price is for the energy that PJM needs to meet demand. </p><p>As I write this on June 10, the spot market was clearing around $25 per megawatt-hour. A plant like Cheswick could, at least theoretically, earn over $300,000 a day in conditions like this and much more if prices spike higher. But, to earn anything at all, it needs to be among the least-expensive resources available to meet demand. This is a problem for Cheswick, as it is a relatively small plant with a single generating unit that uses an older and less-efficient process-while these were once common in Pennsylvania, it is the last of its kind.</p><p>Even when coal plants were competitive, they wouldn't always be able to run at full capacity for long periods of time as required maintenance and market factors would drive down capacity factors. Seeing these facilities averaging around 60% capacity over the course of a year wasn't unusual.</p><p>Increasingly, though, coal plants that are able to run are too expensive to clear the PJM auction and sit idle. According to data from the Energy Information Administration, Cheswick averaged only 15% of its rated capacity in 2019 and not even 10% of its rated capacity in 2020. That's terrible for any business-no one would expect a restaurant to stay open if 90% of its tables remained empty.</p><p>Cheswick was likely only hanging on because of some additional revenue from other sources. Alongside the energy market, PJM also runs a capacity market designed to ensure we have sufficient generation available to meet our needs in the future. This is also an auction system where PJM predicts the amount of generation it will need years in advance and generators submit bids committing to be available, if needed, for a price. Back in 2018, PJM ran an auction for the 2021/22 delivery year that cleared at $140 per megawatt-day for most of the region.</p><p>Over-procuring capacity is a serious problem in these auctions. Every extra megawatt of capacity PJM buys drives up the clearing price, forcing consumers to spend billions of dollars more than necessary and, in many cases, those billions subsidize inefficient, old, and dirty fossil fuel plants running that would otherwise retire. Cheswick is a prime example, a plant that size could see almost $30 million in revenue this year from the capacity market, even if they are rarely called upon to actually generate energy.</p><p>The capacity auction for next year (the 2022/23 delivery year) would have taken place in 2019, but market adjustments required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) delayed the auction until this year. A number of factors, including not needing to predict demand three years in advance, meant PJM didn't find it necessary to procure nearly as much additional capacity. That led to much lower capacity prices.</p><p>Where this year, capacity resources are getting $140 per megawatt-day, next year those payments will drop to $50 per megawatt-day.This drop in the clearing price <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/tom-rutigliano/how-save-four-billion-without-really-trying"">will save consumers about $4.2 billion dollars</a> in total or about $100 on the average electricity bill over the year.</p><p>Not buying billions worth of unnecessary capacity is a huge win for consumers, but it's very bad news for coal. This year we saw 8,175 fewer megawatts worth of coal capacity cleared the market than did in the previous auction. One of the casualties of this was the Cheswick plant. About a week after the PJM auction results were released, the plants owner, GenOn, announced that the plant would cease operation effective June 1, 2022-the first day of PJM's 2022/23 delivery year.</p><p>Any time a fossil fuel plant retires, polluters and their backers almost always blame environmental rules. This is no exception and opponents of Pennsylvania joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) have already made repeated claims that the extra expense from RGGI (which hasn't gone into effect yet) was the reason Cheswick failed to clear the PJM capacity auction. This makes no sense as capacity resources are just making a commitment to be available if called, not necessarily to run. Operating costs, such as RGGI's emissions fees, should be reflected in the company's energy market bids, not the capacity market.<br /><br /> RGGI opponents who make these claims are also saying that if we keep the status quo, where plants like this get to pollute for free, these plants will stay open for ten years or more. The part they don't say out loud is that if polluters don't pay for the cost of their pollution, the rest of us do. Increased pollution means more suffering and premature deaths, higher healthcare and insurance costs for everyone, and lost productivity that increases the costs of everything we buy. On top of that, the added carbon pollution in particular contributes to the trillions of dollars in damages from climate change.</p><p>It's hard to believe that, even accepting the risks and the consequences of dirty power, a coal plant that operates at less than ten percent capacity could stay open very long. Even if Cheswick cleared the capacity market this year, they would still lose almost $20 million in revenue because of the lower capacity prices next year.</p><p>We just tried four years of polluter-friendly policies during the Trump administration and the results are clear. Coal generation in Pennsylvania fell by a greater percentage over the past four years than it did during President Obama's entire 8-year term. Pennsylvania now has only three conventional steam coal plants left that have yet to announce plans to retire or stop burning coal, and those are all close to retirement-age. Rather than lie to workers and communities telling them that opposing RGGI and other environmental programs will save coal jobs, we should be actively managing the transition in our energy sector that is clearly already happening.</p><p>Joining RGGI gives us a pathway to be proactive in addressing this issue. Both the DEP and legislators such as Senators Comitta and Representative Herrin have proposed plans to invest a large part of the proceeds from participating in RGGI in areas most impacted by fossil fuels. This includes investments in Environmental Justice communities that have long faced the consequences of disproportionately high levels of pollution-much of which comes from fossil fuel power plants.This also includes the workers and communities that are impacted by the failure of these plants.</p><p>There is still room for policymakers to step up and have a good faith debate over how to best manage the changes in our energy economy and how best to address the climate crisis. Unfortunately, too many policymakers are quick to oppose proposals like RGGI without offering real alternatives that will lead to a sustainable future.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"

They reported that human exposure to plastic has been linked to a wide variety of human health issues including inflammation of several different organ systems, developmental toxicity, and cancer.</p><p>The crisis is here and can no longer be ignored. The plastic industry knows this and is forming partnerships across the world to come up with solutions to address plastic pollution. The industry has proposed improved recyclability and recycling infrastructure and new end uses for plastics like chemical recycling and plastics to energy plants (See PennFuture's blog <a href=""/Blog-Item-Recycling-is-exacerbating-the-plastic-waste-crisis"">Recycling is Exacerbating the Plastic Waste Crisis</a>).

What Comes Next in Pennsylvania's Efforts to Join RGGI?,5/20/2021,"<p>In October of 2019, Governor Wolf issued an executive order to begin the process of joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).Through this program, Pennsylvania will cooperate with other states in the northeast to cap the emissions of carbon pollution from fossil fuel electric generation because, <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-takes-executive-action-to-combat-climate-change-carbon-emissions/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CClimate%20change%20is%20the%20most,emissions%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Governor%20Wolf.&text=In%20order%20to%20show%20compliance,ton%20of%20CO2%2C%20they%20emit."">as the Governor said at the time</a>,""climate change is the most critical environmental threat confronting the world, and power generation is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.""</p><p>While the Governor started the process with an executive order, actually joining RGGI requires passing a new regulation: the CO2 Budget Trading Program.</p><p>Even with the Governor's executive order, regulations don't just happen.Pennsylvania's Regulatory Review Act and Commonwealth Documents Law create a detailed program of review, checks, and balances, which often takes 18 to 24 months to complete.With the RGGI rule, the PennsylvaniaDepartment of Environmental Protection (DEP) is 19 months into the process.</p><p>The last major milestone was at the end of 2020 when the public was invited to comment on the proposed version of the rule. The DEP took 32 hours of testimony from 449 people and accepted 14,038 written comments. The vast majority of comments supported moving forward, and, as expected, there were also a number of recommendations for updates and clarifications.</p><p>The DEP considered all of that input from residents and updated itsproposal accordingly.This language-known as the ""draft final-form rulemaking""-was just presented to the Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee, the Small Business Compliance Advisory Committee, and the Citizens Advisory Council.All three of these organizations voted to endorse the rule and move forward.</p><p>While it's encouraging these organizations endorsed the DEP's plan, these votes were advisory in nature. The vote that really countsis expected to happen this summer when the DEP presents the complete rulemaking package, including responses to all the public comments, to the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) forformal approval.</p><p>EQB approval is a big step, but even that doesn't end the review process.After that vote the entire package must be delivered to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) and the Environmental Resources and Energy committees in both the state Senate and the House of Representatives.</p><p>IRRC is a panel of five members appointed by the Governor and legislative branch who review regulations and advise whether or notthe Regulatory Review Act criteria have been met, and if it is in the best interest of Pennsylvania to proceed. The panelwill consider the RGGI rulemaking at their next public meeting that is at least 30 days after they receive the package.</p><p>If IRRC votes to approve the rule, the process moves to the next step.If IRRC votes to disapprove the rule, the DEP has 40 days to resubmit or withdraw the package.The DEP isn't actually required to change anything in response to IRRC's concerns, but the agencyneeds to explain itsdecision not to make changes and IRRC will get another chance to consider the rule. A vote to disapprove will slow the process, but IRRC doesn't have the authority to stop a rulemaking from proceeding. The result of a second vote, no matter what the outcome, is simply reported to the committees.</p><p>In most cases, the standing committees take no action on rules one way or another, but we've already seen multiple attempts to block RGGI by the legislature, and it's hard to imagine either of the current committee chairs, Rep. Darryl Metcalfe and Sen.Gene Yaw, missing an opportunity to stall its implementation.It's practically certain that the committees will report a concurrent resolution disapproving of the rule.That will create a delay of 30 calendar days or ten legislative days (whichever is longer) while the General Assembly considers the resolution.</p><p>Given the composition of the Legislature, it's very likely that this resolution will pass.But, the PennsylvaniaSupreme Court has made it clear that there is no such thing as a ""legislative veto"" in Pennsylvania-the only way the Legislature can actually block the program is if the Governor agrees to the resolution or the General Assembly has the two-thirds majority needed to override his veto.</p><p>The General Assembly has already attempted to kill the program more than once and, so far, hasntfound the necessary votes.Having failed to obtain a veto-proof majority, and unwilling to accept the Constitutional limits on their power, members of the Senate <a href=""/News-PennFuture-responds-to-state-Senates-refusal-to-vote-on-PUC-nomination"">even took the unprecedented step</a> of threatening to reject all of Governor Wolf's Publicly Utility Commission nominations unless he agrees to their demands and withdraws the rule.</p><p>While it's seemingly destined to fail, moving a resolution of disapproval will delay implementation at least 30 days.Then, once that resolution is vetoed, the General Assembly will have at least 30 days more to try and override the veto.Ultimately, the anti-RGGI forces are unlikely to prevail and sooner or later, the rule will be sent to the Attorney General for a final review as to legality and form before being published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and going into effect.</p><p>Pennsylvanians want action on climate change and we need a plan to provide a sustainable path forward for the workers and communities impacted by the failures of the fossil fuel industry. For all the rhetoric from the opposition, they have failed to suggest an alternative besides sitting on their hands and doing nothing.</p><p>In fact, doing nothing for as long as possible seems to be the goal.While the opposition has little chance of stopping the program, if they can string enough delaying tactics together it may be possible to push back the start date of the program by a couple of months.</p><p>Delays like this could give polluters more time to dump carbon pollution in our air for free.That is bad for Pennsylvania, but profitable for the polluting industries.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
Regulatory Reforms Would Roll Back Environmental and Health Protections,5/19/2021,"<p>Pennsylvania's legislators appear eager to overhaul how the Commonwealth reviews and implements state law. Don't be distracted. The winners of their latest proposals would likely be polluters - at the expense of public health and the environment.</p><p>Too often, regulations get a bad rap. Seen as burdensometo some, in truth, regulations are merely administrative tools to achieve the General Assembly's policy goals. Regulations allow us to adapt laws to changing times and to ensure new laws are implemented in ways that are safe, fair and legal.</p><p>Permits seem to be in their crosshairs as well. Onerous ""red tape"" to some, in fact, permits are designed to ensure state laws are respected and enforced equitably and effectively. Undermining the process to develop new regulations and implement permits puts Pennsylvania's air and water, workers, consumers, health and economy at risk. That's why the latest proposals are so worrisome.</p><p>HB 139 (Rothman - R, Cumberland County) mandates that state agencies contract with third-party ""professionals"" to review certain permit applications. In practice, the bill would force the already time and cash-strapped Department of Environmental Protection to create a third-party review program.</p><p>Instead of expediting the review process, this would simply undermine it. Outsourcing reviews of federally delegated permits would likely be illegal. And, given the lack of any conflict-of-interest provisions, the legislation would enable polluters to review their own requests to go on polluting.</p><p>HB 288 (O'Neal - R, Washington County) would require agencies designate a ""regulatory compliance officer"" empowered to establish guidelines for waiving fines or penalties. A polluter would simply need to self report their own violation prior to being penalized.Waiving fines and penalties may be appropriate in some circumstances. But those decisions should be made using a thorough and transparent process by agency officials who are publicly accountable. Otherwise, this proposal risks creating a simple get-out-of-jail-free card for anyone who pollutes.</p><p>HB 939 (Klunk - R, York County) is another regulatory rollback that, last year, PennFuture and other environmental groups across the state helped to defeat. In this year's version, the bill would add another layer of bureaucracy to the General Assembly by creating a new review board, potentially creating tension with the current committee system. Originally, this bill would have also established a nonsense rule that, for every new regulation promulgated by an agency, two existing regulations would need to be repealed. Due to widespread public pushback, the prime sponsor of the bill amended out this dangerous provision to make it more palatable for the House to pass.</p><p>Other proposals we're fighting back against include two proposals that we consider unconstitutional attempts to take power from the executive branch. HB 72 (Keefer - R, York and Cumberland Counties) would require House or Senate approval of final-form regulations, essentially giving each chamber a veto over new regulations if they cost more than $1 million to implement the protection. HB 950 (Metcalfe - R, Butler County) would weaken permitting and rulemaking abilities by prohibiting state agencies from reissuing regulations.</p><p>Too often, leaders in the General Assembly decry the overreach and burden of regulations and permits. But at the same time, budget cuts and wrongheaded legislative proposals limit the abilities for our state agencies to do their job.</p><p>Rather than helping to create more efficient and effective government, these latest proposals create extraneous and added layers of bureaucracy, impede the roles of our executive branch agencies, and undermine the protections enforced and implemented by our state government.</p><p>PennFuture will continue to post updates as these counter-productive proposals make their way through the General Assembly.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Ezra P.

Electric Mobility Legislation Could Supercharge EV Infrastructure,5/5/2021,"<p>Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) may have slowed during the coronavirus pandemic. But market forces clearly signal that the future of transportation will be electric.</p><p>In preparation, legislation is making its way through the General Assembly that could supercharge electric mobility across the Commonwealth. The <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&sind=0&body=S&type=B&bn=435"">Clean Transportation Infrastructure Act</a> will require that the state's electric utilities develop comprehensive strategies to expand accessibility and to improve affordability of vehicle charging infrastructure.</p><p>Transportation accounts for a large and growing share of Pennsylvania's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The state's 2020 GHG Inventory shows oil- and gas- powered vehicles are responsible for 25 percent of statewide emissions. That's up by about 4 percent from two years prior.</p><p>Fortunately, change is coming. Across Pennsylvania, public transit agencies and school districts are investing in battery-electric vehicles. Utilities, delivery companies and other private fleet owners are going electric. More individual owners are plugging in EVs at home or at work.</p><p>Technology improvements are driving down vehicle costs, while allowing batteries to retain charges over longer distances. These improvements - combined with a renewed attention from the federal government on decarbonizing transport - <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/electric-mobility-after-the-crisis-why-an-auto-slowdown-wont-hurt-ev-demand"">are fueling growth forecasts</a>. U.S. electric vehicles are expected to reach 3-6 percent of new sales by 2022 and up to 36 percent by 2030.</p><p>SB 435, introduced by Sen. Bob Mensch, will require the Public Utilities Commission to set a statewide transportation electrification goal, encouraging a 50-percent increase in battery-electric, hydrogen or fuel cell electric vehicles over current Pennsylvania 2030 forecasts.</p><p>Less than 30,000 EVs were registered in Pennsylvania as of November 2020, according to the Department of Environmental Protection's Pennsylvania <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/StateEnergyProgram/PAElectricVehRoadmapBookletDEP5334.pdf"">Electric Vehicle Roadmap</a>. EV ownership here is about 25 percent of neighboring New Jersey's.</p><p>Massive electrification of the transportation sector will require large-scale investment in new electric distribution and widespread installation of new charging infrastructure. To better prepare for this transformation, SB 435 would require the state's largest utilities develop electrification plans for the 18 largest counties across the Commonwealth.</p><p>Importantly, SB 435 would also allow utilities to recover costs for building new charging infrastructure or for incentivizing property owners and private developers to install chargers at their homes, offices, bus depots, shopping centers, parking garages and wherever else it's needed. The legislation sets a maximum surcharge of 0.25 percent on annual customer bills.</p><p>Benefits of SB 435 would include:</p><ul><li>Developing a strategy to overcome the main barrier to EV accessibility - the availability of charging infrastructure.</li><li>Assisting regions across the state meet Clean Air Act air quality targets.</li><li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to the climate crisis.</li><li>Supporting economic development by displacing imported oil with electricity generated from Pennsylvania-based energy resources including renewable energy.</li><li>Promoting economic growth and job creation by encouraging private investment in cars, buses and equipment that Pennsylvania businesses are helping to develop.</li><li>Requiring extensive transportation sector coordination and regulatory review of any proposed utility EV infrastructure investments.</li><li>Positioning Pennsylvania for leadership as changes underway across the transportation industry continue to unfold.</li></ul><p>PennFuture strongly supports SB 435. We are part of a broad and diverse coalition of organizations that believe this legislation provides a thoughtful and well-balanced framework to significantly advance EVs in Pennsylvania.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Ezra P.

Legislators Continue to Stand in the Way of Climate Action,5/4/2021,"<p>Leaders in the General Assembly are offering more unproductive proposals that would undermine Pennsylvania's entry into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Despite past failed attempts, again and again, they expect different results. As the saying goes, their approach to climate policy is truly insane.</p><p>This latest attempt comes as an abundance of Pennsylvanians support climate action. The only logical explanation for ignoring the will of the voters is that our state's legislators prefer to do the bidding of the state's fossil fuel industry.</p><p>The shameful undermining of climate progress comes in the form of Senate Bill 119 (Pittman - R, Indiana County). The proposal would strip away the Department of Environmental Protection's statutory authority to adopt regulations to reduce carbon pollution from any source, including power plants. This is despite clear precedent that the governor possesses legal authority to implement a cap-and-invest carbon reduction program.</p><p>Make no mistake; the intention of the bill's sponsors is clear. If Pennsylvania were to join RGGI, power plants would no longer be allowed to release carbon pollution for free. The power sector would have to start paying a price for air pollution that they cause.</p><p>Governor Tom Wolf's <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/executive-order-2019-07-commonwealth-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change-through-electric-sector-emissions-reductions/"">Executive Order 2019-07 instructed the DEP to develop</a> a cap-and-invest program that aligns with RGGI. Joining RGGI would encourage innovation and create a revenue stream that Pennsylvania could re-invest in programs that further reduce air pollution. Other states are already reaping the benefits. Ten current RGGI member states <a href=""https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">have experienced $1.4 billion in net economic benefits</a> between 2015 and 2017.</p><p>Yet another effort to prevent action on climate change - a similar bill <a href=""/News-PennFuture-responds-to-veto-of-House-Bill-2025"">was vetoed last September by Governor Wolf</a> - SB 119 would preserve the profit margins of fossil fuel executives.<br /> SB 119 not only reflects a lack of desire among the Legislature to lead on climate progress. It reflects a failure to listen to voters across the state.</p><p>After RGGI was explained in a recent poll, <a href=""https://www.centredaily.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/article246260895.html"">more than 70 percent of surveyed Pennsylvanians</a> expressed their support. The public clearly understands that RGGI membership would have beneficial effects on addressing climate change, improving public health and boosting the state's economy.</p><p>DEP has been working for months drafting RGGI regulations, listening to thousands of comments from industry, advocacy groups and ordinary Pennsylvanians. Instead of working with the administration to improve the rulemaking process, SB 119 is a waste of state resources and another disappointing attempt to block DEP from combating the climate crisis.</p><p>SB 119 could come up for a vote in the state Senate as soon as next week when the Senate returns to session.</p><p><a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/antirggibills"">Do your part today and contact your elected officials.

Pennsylvania vs. the Future,4/30/2021,"<p>In other parts of our nation, it is the spring of 2021.We have a president who understands that climate change is a crisis, who is making the first movements in a long time towards incorporating environmental justice issues into decision-making, and who is bringing a ""whole of government approach"" to environmental problems.</p><p>In addition to President Biden's early executive orders on climate change and other environmental issues, <a href=""/Blog-Item-A-Breath-of-Fresh-Air-Two-Steps-and-Hopefully-More-Forward-on-Environmental-Justice-and-Water-Protection"">which we previously covered in this blog</a>, the administration has advanced concrete policy proposals that include climate goals at their core.</p><p>The American Jobs Plan provides funding for infrastructure, clean energy, innovation, manufacturing and workplace support, and the caregiving economy. By incorporating support for the renewable electric grid into a key economic plan, the President is <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Time-to-Hesitate-is-Through"">trying to launch a more sustainable American economy</a> while simultaneously combating climate change.Additionally, last week, the President <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/"">announced a commitment to 50-52 percent reduction</a> from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030.This is not just a goal - it is the United States' ""nationally determined contribution"" or ""NDC,"" which is a formal submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. </p><p>While the United States' goal is certainly not easy or automatic, the administration recognizes that an ambitious goal is necessary and is explicitly connecting policies and plans for job creation and economic development to responding to the climate crisis.</p><p>But in the Pennsylvania legislature, things are different.Our legislature seems determined to resist any attempts to move forward and remains firmly stuck in the past.</p><p>In the past few weeks, both the State House and the State Senate have released a flurry of proposed legislation designed to push Pennsylvania back into the past. Some of these are explicitly designed to prevent action on climate change, and others are less explicit but still clearly motivated by a desire to frustrate problem-solving.</p><p>An example of an explicitly anti-environment bill is Senate Bill 119 (Pittman - R, Indiana County), which would take away DEP's statutory authority to adopt regulations to reduce carbon pollution from any source, including power plants consistent with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).This bill was vetoed last September by Governor Wolf. DEP has been working round the clock for months on its proposed RGGI regulations, including listening to thousands of comments from industry, advocacy groups, and ordinary Pennsylvanians.</p><p>There is no purpose to this bill other than to waste state resources and attempt to frustrate a meaningful attempt to combat the climate change that threatens our future.</p><p>Then there is House Bill 939, which, among other things, would create a process for ""sunsetting"" existing regulations by capping the number of regulations and requiring the repeal of two existing regulations for every new regulation promulgated.If this sounds familiar, it is because the former presidential administration attempted to do this on a federal level.Looking for models in the abject failures of the last administration is not the way to move into the future.</p><p>Fortunately, the legislature is not the entirety of the government in the Commonwealth.Governor Wolf issued an executive order committing the state to purchase at least 40% of its electricity from new solar arrays built here.Municipalities like the City of Philadelphia are taking climate change seriously and committing to ambitious carbon reduction goals to try to get there.It's just the legislature that is stuck.</p><p>We deserve better from our elected state representatives.They need to stop standing in the way of our future.</p><p>For more information and to learn more about what you can do to tell your legislators to vote no on these antiquated pieces of legislation, visit <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org"">www.pennfuture.org</a>.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jessica O'Neill, Senior Attorney"
PennFuture Releases New Report to Save Chesapeake Bay,4/8/2021,"<p>We are at an inflection point for Pennsylvania's efforts to save the Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>What policymakers in the Keystone State do-or more importantly, what they do not do-over the next five years will determine not only the fate of many of the Commonwealth's rivers and streams in the Susquehanna and Potomac River Basins, but also the fate of America's largest estuary and third largest in the world.</p><p>There are more than 15,000 miles of polluted streams within Pennsylvania's portion of the Susquehanna and Potomac River basins. The Susquehanna River itself is the source of drinking water for 6.2 million people. This pollution impacts how we use our water-whether it's fewer opportunities for fishing, unsafe waters for recreation, or high costs for using it for drinking and business.</p><p>The river's pollution stretches well beyond our state borders. Half of all the freshwater that comprises the Chesapeake Bay comes from Pennsylvania, which means Pennsylvania plays an important role in ongoing efforts to clean up the polluted bay.</p><p>While Pennsylvania isn't the only culprit-five other states and Washington, D.C. also contribute to the problem-our contributions are among the highest, especially for nitrogen. The dirty water in the basin is so dire that Pennsylvania has been placed under a so-called ""pollution diet"" by the Environmental Protection Agency meant to limit the amount of pollution we send down into the Susquehanna and Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>With that sense of urgency in mind, PennFuture today released a policy agenda designed to give Pennsylvania lawmakers a roadmap to fund clean water programs and to get us back on track toward meeting our obligations to clean up the bay.</p><p>The report, <a href=""/Files/Admin/Final-Chesapeake-report.pdf"">""Underfunded and Polluted: Solutions to Fund Clean Water in Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake Bay Watershed,""</a> puts forth a legislative agenda that, if acted upon, would provide the technical assistance, agency support, and public investments needed to put Pennsylvania on the path toward meeting our ""pollution diet"" goals by the 2025 deadline.</p><p>Specifically, we recommend policy solutions and funding amounts that would result in the reduction of pollution from its major source-agriculture lands-as well as stormwater runoff and forestry-related practices. We also recommend that our state agencies are funded properly and operating with sufficient capacity to carry out the programs and assistance needed to accomplish state pollution goals.</p><p>The report also identifies funding mechanisms that are available to state legislators to help achieve these policy goals, including a severance tax on natural gas extraction, eliminating the sales tax exemption for bottled water, levying a fee on single-use plastic bags, and establishing a water use fee for large commercial operations in Pennsylvania, among others.</p><p>The pathways spelled out in our report complement efforts already underway in the state Capitol, as two bills with bipartisan support could soon come up for a vote in Harrisburg.<br /> The first is SB 251 which seeks to implement new standards and regulations on lawn fertilizer application across Pennsylvania, while SB 465 would create a statewide Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program to help more farmers and landowners implement practices to combat nonpoint source agricultural runoff to our streams, creeks, and rivers. We will be watching these bills closely and doing our part to support them.</p><p>Properly funding clean water initiatives isn't just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. Clean water is a critical component of Pennsylvania's thriving recreation economy, which is the 6th largest in the country and produced $13 billion in revenue, according to 2019 figures. It's also a critical investment in our farmers, one of Pennsylvania's top economic sectors accounting for approximately $83.8 billion in direct economic output and over 280,500 jobs.</p><p>Now is a critical time for state policy leaders to show its residents that they're upholding their right to clean water and good health as well as strongly support its recreation businesses and farmers.</p><p>Now is the time to invest in our waterways.</p><p>To read our report, <a href=""/Files/Admin/Final-Chesapeake-report.pdf"">please click here.</a></p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Renee Reber, Campaign Manager, Watershed Advocacy"
The Time to Hesitate is Through,4/1/2021,"<p>President Joe Biden's American Jobs Planannouncement in Pittsburgh elicits great pride in being a Pennsylvanian. It feels like it's been ages since the leader of the United States has put forth a vision of the future that moves us forward-no matter whether we work in the frack fields or an office building, reside in a rural county or city, or we're beset by pollution or economic hardship. It's a historic initiative, that if enacted fully by Congress, would be a watershed moment for the country and Commonwealth.</p><p>Biden's economic plan goes way beyond kick-starting an economy hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.At its core, the President's American Jobs Plan would overhaul our antiquated infrastructure, build resiliency to extreme weather and support new carbon reduction technologies that match and excel beyond the efforts of global competitors currently making their mark in this sector.</p><p>The plan will launch a more sustainable American economy anchored by cutting-edge business sectors and family-sustaining jobs that don't rely on polluting our communities and children to succeed. The President's plan would finally and proportionally invest in addressing the climate crisisby deploying renewable energy, retrofitting homes and businesses, investing in clean energy innovation, and advancing ways for industry to lower its carbon footprint.The plan will rightly will give our country a fighting start to meet the daily reality of climate change.And it will seed the projects, tools and technologies we need to address the climate crisis, one made more evident every day, and neglected for far too long.</p><p>But of all the places he could have made his announcement, why did the President choose Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania? One reason is the abundance of concrete proposals and feasible ideas emanating from the region that are in sync with the President's economic vision, including<a href=""https://reimagineappalachia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ReImagineAppalachia_Blueprint_092020.pdf"">Reimagine Appalachia's blueprint</a>, <a href=""https://www.sustainablebusiness.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/marshall_plan_for_middle_america_roadmap_0.pdf"">the Marshall Plan for Middle America</a>, and <a href=""/Files/Admin/Green-Stimulus-FINAL.pdf"">PennFuture's Green Stimulus and Economic Recovery Platform for Pennsylvania</a>. These independently-crafted platforms all share the common goal of lifting up the Commonwealth through shared prosperity and future-oriented, sustainable economic opportunities.</p><p>Why do such synergies exist between the region and the President's economic plan? Maybe only an individual like President Biden, whose formative years were spent in the coal fields of upper Appalachia's Anthracite region, can get why perpetuating fossil fuels as the foundation for future economic growth and opportunity is wrong on so many fronts. As someone who, like the President, has kept their ties to the region, its scarred landscapes, and its strong and proud people, I understand firsthand the President's perspective.</p><p>Appalachia's coal fields, where the President was born, are a poster-child for what the American Jobs Plan aims to address: boom-and-bust cycles of fossil fuels industries crippling towns, oppression wrought by big companies when workers are unprotected by unions, and the psychological and demoralizing impacts keeping coal communities from pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. Biden experienced and was witness to these declines, and knows they are frightening for communities in the midst of such change, and equally frightening for policymakers to understand and address.</p><p>Unless, that is, you are the kind of leader that Biden is, whose experience and empathy has won him much political support from the region and from local influencers who share his vision.President Biden's vision of prosperity is anchored in the future, and not a distant future, but rather one that is within our reach, if we can all stretch just a bit further and take hold.If we can drop our swords, together we can take a run at doing something monumental and meaningful for our people, to set the country up for success in the new economy, and to make things right for the have-nots among us.</p><p>The fight for the President's American Jobs Plan will be a political battle, to be sure.The thing that will make the fight so tough is partisan identity. Ideologies, political or otherwise, divide and blind us to what is right before our eyes: opportunity and seeing that the world around us has changed. Internationally, we see the most powerful and influential regions shift to a sustainable future, while America drags its feet because there are those among us who don't want to see others ""win"" or because some among us believe we can stop societal or demographic change using a wall, an insurrection, a vote, or the suppression of one. </p><p>Back here in Pennsylvania, and at PennFuture, we are all for making up for lost time and lost opportunity.We stand eager and ready to move beyond the societal infighting and work to advance solutions that benefit all of us. We are leaning hard into the prospects for federal action on resilient infrastructure and climate solutions.We believe if passed, the President's American Jobs Plan can yield great things for our state.

Net Metering Works for Pennsylvania,3/31/2021,"<p>In the early days of distributed generation, utilities would sell power to consumers at the retail rate but, if customers were able to sell excess power they generated back to the utility at all, the utilities would only pay the much-lower wholesale rate.This systematically undervalued the benefits of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar power and provided very little incentive to invest in such systems.Today, most states require some form of ""net metering"" to ensure customers are more fairly paid for their generation.Even where it is not required, state regulators must at least consider rules to makenet metering available<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>A number of different generation technologies can qualify for net metering, but grid-tie solar systems on homes and businesses are probably the most common. They use a device known as an inverter to turn the low-voltage DC the solar panels produce to the higher-voltage AC we use to power lights and appliances.Such systems are designed to draw power from the local electricity distribution grid whenever they need it and send power back when they have excess.This type of system is often much simpler to install and much less expensive than off-the-grid alternatives that require batteries or other backup generation.</p><p>Unfortunately, a recent study found that overall, ""grid-tied utility customers are being grossly undercompensated in most of the U.S. as the value of solar eclipses the net metering rate<sup>2</sup>.""</p><p><u><strong>The value of net metered solar generation</strong></u></p><p>Most consumers recognize the value of buying from local businesses, even when big online stores might offer lower prices.Buying local supports the jobs that were created in the community to build and operate that business, and the money consumers spend locally is more likely to stay in that community.Operating a small solar system shares many of these same benefits.</p><p>A small solar system installed on a home or business should easily pay for itselfin avoided energy costs over the life of the equipment.But, these systems have more value than just the direct energy savings that they provide to their owners-they provide benefits to all ratepayers throughout the community.</p><p>Because most of our electricity is purchased through wholesale market auctions, adding any new behind-the-meter generation<sup>3</sup> results in less demand and, therefore, lowers the market clearing price.This lowers wholesale prices for everyone-even on days when the solar panels aren't sending any power back to the grid<sup>4</sup>.Solar generation can magnify this effect when more power is produced on the same hot summer days that electricity demand, and wholesale prices, often peak.</p><p>Besides moderating wholesale energy prices, having more distributed generation can lead to lower spending on reserve generating capacity and infrastructure. Nationally, we spend over $100 billion a year to maintain and upgrade our grid-avoiding even a small fraction of those costs can result in significant savings.</p><p>In addition to savings on energy, capacity, and infrastructure, newer technologies like smart inverters can also provide a wide range of valuable grid services.These include things like load following, reactive power support, demand response, and other services that consumers never need to think about but are important to grid operators who need to keep the system functioning smoothly and efficiently.</p><p>The benefits of additional clean generation go far beyond direct savings for ratepayers and grid operators.Every megawatt of avoided fossil fuel generation means less pollution-including smog-forming chemicals, cancer-causing air toxics, and the carbon pollution driving climate change.Less pollution means less spending on medical care and increased productivity.</p><p>Fairness demands that we pay net-metered solar generators for the full value of the services they provide.</p><p><u><strong>Net Metering in Pennsylvania</strong></u></p><p>Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act includes a requirement that ""excess generation from net-metered customer-generators shall receive full retail value for all energy produced on an annual basis<sup>5</sup>."" That is a strong standard but, to date, neither our Public Utility Commission (PUC) nor our courts have fact-based determination on what ""full retail value"" actually is. Moreover, there is reason to believe that the PUC's current proxies for full retail value may understate actual full retail value.</p><p>PUC rules specify that customers get a bill credit for the ""full retail rate"" (emphasis added) for net generation month-to-month and, that where a customer has not been compensated for all of its igeneration at the end of the year, the customer should be paid for that net generation the ""price to compare"" (i.e. the amount that customers who do not shop on PA Power Switch pay for electricity generation and transmission)<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>There are two problems with this framework. First, retail rates are a very coarse approximation of value.Value depends on factors that rates do not fully take into account.As one study put it, an accurate value of solar requires ""evaluating economic development costs, the avoided fuel hedge costs, the avoided voltage regulation costs, secondary health and environmental effects such as increased crop yields from PV-reduced pollution, and accurate estimations of the value of avoided GHG liability costs or avoided GHG emissions liability insurance.<sup>7</sup>"" These are not things typically reflected in retail rates and particularly not in the lower price-to-compare</p><p><u><strong>Defending Net Metering</strong></u></p><p>When SolarReviews looked at state net metering policies in early 2021, Pennsylvania earned fairly high ratings compared to other states but had some room for improvement<sup>8</sup>. Keeping the gains we've made hasn't been without its challenges.Utility trade associations like the Edison Electric Institute, and anti-regulatory groups like ALEC have been leading the attacks.</p><p>They generally start by ignoring the non-energy values of solar generation and then push the false narrative that paying net metered generators anything more than wholesale prices always represents a cost shift that impacts other ratepayers.When distributed solar levels become high, as they have in California, cost-shifting can become an issue. But critics of net metering routinely make these claims even where distributed solar levels are low, as they are in Pennsylvania, anddespite the lack of actual evidence.</p><p>Back in 2016, Pennsylvania's own PUC fell victim to these arguments and attempted to create more barriers to net metered generation.PennFuture and other solar advocates were successful in preventing new caps on the size of net-metered systems, arguing that the PUC simply didn't have the authority to substitute their judgment for that of our Legislature. Still, problems remained.</p><p>One of the most obvious problems was the Commission's view on virtual meter aggregation.AEPS specifically allows a net metered generation system to be attached to a separate electric meter, provided it's within two miles of the primary meter.This is particularly useful for farms where a nearby field is a more suitable location than the existing house or barn.PUC tried to add the arbitrary restriction that any such remote site needed a pre-existing independent electric load.</p><p>The Commision said at the time this was necessary to prevent ""utilities"" from qualifying for net metering.This never made any sense. Since Pennsylvania's Electricity Generation Customer Choice and Competition Act passed in 1996, utilities have divested of all their generation assets<sup>9</sup> and, as we pointed out at the time, utilities are prevented from qualifying for net metering because the AEPS defines a net-metered customer generator as a ""non-utility""<sup>10</sup>. Moreover, we argued PUC just doesn't have the authority under Pennsylvania law to create new restrictions that go beyond what the Legislature provided.</p><p>Even though the Independent Regulatory Review Commission agreed with our position and disapproved the new restrictions, the PUC went forward and promulgated the faulty rules. I wrote back at the time that ""people may be denied interconnection for their solar systems in situations where the legislation gives them the right to install that generation."" Not surprisingly, that is exactly what happened.</p><p><u><strong>A Belated Victory</strong></u></p><p>On Feb 17, the PA Supreme Court upheld a May 2020 decision by the Commonwealth Court<sup>11</sup> regarding the PUC's attempt to regulate net metering and virtual net metering. That ruling made it clear we were correct on several important points when we made comments to the PUC and IRRC back in 2016.</p><p>The court held the PUC's authority related to net metering is exactly what the AEPS statute says-they may enact ""technical and net metering interconnection rules,"" not address broader questions of energy policy. The Legislature set specific limitations regarding the size of net metered systems along with other policy decisions and it's not the PUC's role to second-guess the laws.</p><p>The court also made it clear that, while the PUC has broad authority to regulate utilities, that doesn't grant them the power to limit net metered generation because ""the AEPS Act applies to customer-generators, which by definition are not public utilities."" Also, the PUC's attempt to redefine the term utility to include companies that are not public utilities is unenforceable as it ""attempts to redefine statutory eligibility standards.""</p><p>Finally, the independent load requirement for virtual net metering was specifically rejected as it has no basis in the statute and beyond the PUC authority. It took a number of years, but it's encouraging to know our reading of the legislation was correct.</p><p><u><strong>What this means going forward</strong></u></p><p>While this ruling fixes the glaring problems with the PUCs rules,there are still some parts of the existing legislation that can be improved.</p><p>A significant number of Pennsylvania's households and businesses don't have effective solar access. This is particularly true for renters and those living in multi-family households, but there are a number of other issues that can make it difficult for homeowners to generate their own clean energy.</p><p>Many states have fixed this problem by enabling community solar.Under these rules, a family or business may buy or lease a share of a larger solar system and receive a credit on their energy bill for the power their share of the system generates.</p><p>While this is similar to ""virtual meter aggregation"" as defined by AEPS, the existing rules have additional restrictions that will keep community solar from happening.The current rules say thatthe remote site hosting the solar system be owned or leased by the same entity as the primary electric meter it is to be netted with.In addition, that remote site must be within 2-miles of the primary meter.</p><p>There is a fix on the horizon-Sen. Scavello recently introduced SB 472 in the Pennsylvania Senate and we expect a similar bill to be introduced by Rep. Kauffer in the House that will specifically enable community solar generation.This will allow qualifying systems to share their generation among a number of subscribers.</p><p>The one piece that is still outstanding is whether or not customer generators are actually getting the full retail value for the energy they generate and the services they provide. A fair and independent analysis that includes all the energy and ancillary benefits of distributed generation and clean renewable energy would go a long way to filling this gap. Then PUC Vice Chairman Andrew Place was correct when he said ""consumers are best served by getting the 'retail value' price right<sup>12</sup>.</p><p><u>Footnotes</u></p><ol><li>Sec. 1251, Energy Policy Act of 2005, P.L. 109-58 (Aug. 8, 2005)</li><li>K.S.

A Banner Week for the Delaware River Watershed,3/5/2021,"<div><p>It was a banner week for Pennsylvania's portion of the Delaware River Watershed, as three events unfolded here that could have enormous ramifications for clean water for decades to come.</p><p>The first big event occurred on Feb. 25 when <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/fracking-ban-delaware-river-permanent-drbc-20210225.html"">the Delaware River Basin Commission permanently banned fracking</a> within the basin, a truly momentous step for clean water in Pennsylvania.</p><p>The move came after a decade of considerations and studies by the commission, as well as lawsuits by the fracked gas industry and Pennsylvania politicians <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2021/01/18/State-senators-lawsuit-fracking-ban-pennsylvania-Delaware-River-Basin-baker-yaw/stories/202101180072"">who sought to undo a fracking moratorium</a> imposed by the DRBC in 2010.</p><p>Despite that, the commission-composed of the governors of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware, with the federal representative abstaining-voted last week to permanently ban fracking in the basin.</p><p>In explaining his vote, <a href=""https://www.nj.com/news/2021/02/fracking-permanently-banned-in-delaware-river-basin.html"">New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said that</a> ""fracking poses significant risks to the water resources of the Delaware River Basin,"" and he's right. The Delaware River Basin provides drinking water to 13 million people, which is reason enough to protect it at all costs.</p><p>In addition, the fracked gas industry in Pennsylvania <a href=""/Blog-Item-Setting-the-Record-Straight-About-Fracking-in-Pennsylvania"">has a long and infamous history of disrespecting our laws</a>, communities, shared resources and environment, and it cannot be trusted to act in our best interests.

Tom Wolf, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Patrick McDonnell said the fracking ban will preserve our pristine water resources in the basin <a href=""http://www.paenvironmentdigest.com/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=52380&SubjectID="">""for generations to come.""</a></p><p>To see what PennFuture had to say about this historic vote, <a href=""/News-PennFuture-responds-to-Delaware-River-Basin-Commission-vote-on-fracking-ban"">please click here.</a></p><p>Another significant development for clean water in the basin came on March 3 when Philadelphia and several nearby municipalities <a href=""https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/green/philly-some-suburbs-drag-pa-to-court-over-blocking-plastic-bag-bans/2727375/"">announced litigation against the state</a> concerning the so-called ""ban on plastic bag bans.""</p><p>For context, in 2019 and again in 2020, the General Assembly in Harrisburg passed legislation that forbids any municipality in Pennsylvania from banning plastic bags.

$296,3/2/2021,"<p>PennFuture has published the third edition of a Fossil Fuel Subsidy report that first appeared in 2011. The 2021 version is entitled <a href=""/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">""Buried Out of Sight: Uncovering Pennsylvania's Hidden Fossil Fuel Subsidies.""</a></p><p>Our report reveals that Pennsylvania's fossil fuel subsidies total $3.8 billion, with 52 percent of that amount benefitting fracked gas and petrochemicals. At a time of a climate emergency,pandemic, racial reckoning and an economic downturn that somehow is building extravagant wealth for billionaires while others struggle to make rent and buy food, the inequity and cronyism behind these subsidies strikes one as especially appalling.</p><p>The report is having an impact.</p><p>We've heard from many throughout the state who are dismayed over the findings, but who are glad the information is seeing the light of day. They are reacting most to the figure that when spread across all residents of Pennsylvania, these subsidies amount to $296 per person living here.</p><p>Boosters of fracking, petrochemicals and plastics want to keep this information hidden from the public.</p><p>The report has hit a nerve over at Frack Central-the cabal of trade associations and companies that coordinate their advocacy to protect these subsidies-whose public relations machine is churning out messages accusing our meticulously researched report as sloppy. They falsely argue that our commonsense recommendations to have polluters pay their fair share to do business in our state is the equivalent of calling for your taxes to be increased.</p><p>Organizers of Frack Central, like the Marcellus Shale Coalition, are singularly focused on attacking the report. This includes their lazy messaging that distorts and simplifies our very sophisticated analysis.</p><p>Our most basic recommendation is that state agencies be charged with transparency and that they make subsidy information publicly available on a regular basis. </p><p>These distortions by industry spin doctors will not be an effective rebuttal of our report's analysis and our <a href=""/Files/Admin/Subsidy-graph.JPG"">daylighting of the facts and figures</a> that make up the tangled and hidden truth behind these $3.8 million in subsidies. Frack Central's smear campaign has traction, though, when it gets amplified by its friends in the legislature, and elsewhere, and this is happening.</p><p>I invite you to review the dense report, with an eye <a href=""/Files/Admin/Subsidy-chart.JPG"">to the chart on page 4</a>.There, you can see for yourself the long list of offending exemptions from taxes that the rest of us are subject to, and that can produce tax revenues, including for local governments and services.</p><p>The fact is the financial largesse of subsidies shown to the fossil fuel industry is hurting our state's bottom line.Let's remember these subsidies are provided with the blessing of many state elected officials, and the Governor, who are often at odds with each other on the topic of how to generate much needed new revenues in our state. So why make the money matter worse through these goodies to the fossil fuel industry?</p><p>The fact is that these subsidies are robbing our state of $2 billion annually in foregone revenues. If the majority of subsidies could be abolished, we can level the playing field between frackers and fossils, and pretty much everyone else including taxpayers, small businesses and other less-favored business sectors who have many fewer lobbyists in Harrisburg pleading their case.</p><p>The time has come for the fossil fuel industry to pay its fair share and its most egregious subsidies terminated. This includes paying even the most basic taxes from which frackers and crackers are exempted, namely paying property taxes.</p><p>Lastly, since PennFuture's report is based on the most recently available information from 2019, it discusses, but does not calculate, the financial impacts and lost revenues associated with two recent subsidies directed toward petrochemical development.</p><p>First is the subsidy package totaling $1.6 billion in grants, tax exemptions and other programs offered to Royal Dutch Shell for its ethane cracker in Beaver County. According to Good Jobs First Subsidy Tracker, Shell ranks seventh among the companies that have generated the most public subsidies in the United States, totaling more than $2.04 billion, with other support also coming from places like Louisiana and Texas. The $1.65 billion package Pennsylvania offered Shell is over 15 times the size of the next largest corporate subsidy offered here. The second largest was a$100 million package granted to Volkswagen in the late 1970s for a manufacturing plant in Westmoreland County. The 2.8-million-square foot plant is now closed.</p><p>Second are the subsidies recently approved in July 2020 (House Bill 732) for petrochemical facilities. This legislation includes tax credits - in place for 26 years and adding up to over $693 million in foregone tax revenue - and is made available for up to four facilities that manufacture only petrochemicals and fertilizers using fracked gas.</p><p>In other words, in a couple of years it's very possible Pennsylvania's fossil fuel subsidy package will balloon from $3.7 billion to almost $6 billion. Yet, Pennsylvania legislators argue nearly every spring about Pennsylvania's budget deficit or high taxeswhen one of the reasons for these perpetual challenges is their own doing.</p><p>PennFuture hopes that by bringing sunlight to this growing subsidy problem in Pennsylvania, better policy making can happen in the future. The perpetual cycle of subsidies, boom, and bust fossil fuel industries is a detriment to the Commonwealth. Breaking this feedback loop is one of the keys to a better future.</p><p>For more, <a href=""https://www.goerie.com/story/opinion/columns/2021/02/26/fossil-fuel-subsidies-dont-pay-off-pennsylvanians/4573779001/"">read this piece by Rob Altenburg</a>, Director of PennFuture's Energy Center, and co-author of the Fossil Fuels Subsidies report.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jacquelyn Bonomo, PennFuture President and CEO"
A Breath of Fresh Air: How Will the Biden Administration Fight Carbon Pollution?,3/1/2021,"<p>The beginning of 2021 has been busy for clean energy advocates.</p><p>On January 14th, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection wrapped up its public comment period on its proposed CO2 Budget Trading Program, through which Pennsylvania would cooperate with the other Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) states to minimize dangerous emissions across much of the northeast and invest in cleaner alternatives.</p><p>In all, DEP heard from 449 citizens over a series of ten virtual public hearings and from over 14,000 citizens who submitted written comments. The response was overwhelmingly positive and shows the vast support across Pennsylvania for cutting carbon pollution and fighting climate change.</p><p>Just days after the DEP wrapped up this process, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the Trump administration's anti-environmental ""ACE rule"". </p><p>Although ACE stands for ""Affordable Clean Energy"" that name was always a cynical joke. The Clean Air Act requires power plants to adopt the best system of emissions reduction (BSER) to cut pollution that endangers public health and welfare. With ACE however, Trump's EPA attempted to redefine BSER to exclude the most cost effective approaches-including programs like the DEP's CO2 Budget Trading Program.</p><p>Repealing ACE was sure to be a high priority for the incoming Biden administration, but the cumbersome regulatory process to do so could easily have taken years. Fortunately, the D.C. Circuit's action throwing out the Trump EPA's horrible plan saves the Biden administration the effort of scrapping it. Now, the new leadership at EPA can focus their attention on what the next steps should be.</p><p>We won't know exactly what the new plan will look like until EPA releases a proposal, but we can make some educated guesses based on other initiatives of the Biden administration.</p><p>While Trump made a public show of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, actual withdrawal wasn't effective until November 4th, 2020 and one of President Biden's first action after his inauguration was to rejoin the agreement.</p><p>At the center of the Paris Agreement are individual long-term goals set by the parties known as <em>nationally determined contributions</em>. Where President Obama submitted a target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, President Biden is expected to establish targets more consistent with his stated goal of achieving a carbon-free power sector by 2035 and net zero emissions economy-wide by 2050.</p><p>There are a number of different pathways towards reaching these goals, but the most straightforward method would be for Congress to pass legislation that caps carbon pollution and invests in clean alternatives. One possible model for this type of legislation was the Waxman-Markey Bill that was passed by the House in 2009 but was never brought up for a vote by the Senate. A modernized version of that bill reflecting the most current science and the Biden's administration's priorities could easily drive the sort of reductions we need.</p><p>That isn't the only legislative path of course. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, legislation related to the Green New Deal, and other alternatives could all lead to the needed emission reductions. Whether such bills would have enough support to overcome a filibuster in the Senate remains to be seen-polluting industries still wield considerable political power.</p><p>If the legislative pathway is blocked, the administration could use its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to get the needed emissions reductions. This is what the Obama administration did when it finalized its Clean Power Plan (CPP). In that case, existing fossil fuel power plants were required to meet certain standards of performance-the aforementioned BSER. This could be accomplished by installing new technology at the facilities themselves, but CPP also allowed states and regions to meet the standards in aggregate through programs like RGGI. </p><p>While the eventual federal approach may not necessarily require states to implement a cap-and-invest system like Governor Wolf has proposed or join a multi-state effort such as RGGI, there are some good reasons for considering that pathway, even apart from preventing 188 million tons of carbon pollution, millions of dollars worth of co-benefits from other emissions reductions, and the potential for investment in clean and sustainable technologies that RGGI brings.</p><p>First, to the extent that we are required to meet federal emission targets, modeling indicates that multi-state compliance programs such as joining RGGI would likely be the most cost-effective means to do so. This should be obvious: instead of needing to reduce emissions at each individual plant, a trading program allows those reductions to be made wherever they are cheapest. A multi-state trading program provides a bigger pool of options, so finding a less-expensive alternative becomes more likely.</p><p>Having a strong federal program also mitigates another concern with RGGI-emissions leakage. We are very familiar with this concept in Pennsylvania where, as a member of Ozone Transport Region (OTR), facilities in our state sometimes need to meet more stringent rules than similar facilities in non-OTR states like Ohio. This gives some incentive for businesses to locate operations in jurisdictions where regulations and oversight are more lax.</p><p>As expected, modeling conducted on the proposed CO2 Cap and Invest program identified some effects of leakage. While CO2 pollution will fall across the board, emissions in Pennsylvania are expected to decline more than emissions in the grid as a whole-that indicates some limited shifting of generation to out of state companies could happen.</p><p>If this were a very large effect, Pennsylvania's program could be adjusted to compensate for the problem. There is a better solution though-if the federal government requires other states to achieve similar emissions reductions as a result of the Biden administrations new targets, there will be no incentive for leakage.</p><p>Even though federal action is likely on the way, Pennsylvania can and should move forward with its own proposed CO2 Cap and Invest program without delay.</p><p>Again, not only does this bring all the net benefits DEP identified that much sooner, it also puts Pennsylvania in a better position to influence the coming federal action. The Clean Air Act makes good use of a concept called ""cooperative federalism.""</p><p>This, essentially, lets states innovate and tailor programs to best fit their needs while the federal government provides a strong backstop ensuring critical standards are met If we act now, there is a much greater chance the federal program will accommodate decisions we make in Pennsylvania. If we delay, we may cede some of that flexibility.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
Fracking Banned in Delaware River Basin,2/25/2021,"<p>After a decade of consideration and study, the Delaware River Basin Commission has finally banned hydraulic fracturing in the Delaware River Basin. This is a truly momentous step.</p><p>For the past decade, there has been <a href=""/Blog-Item-Moratorium-on-Fracking-in-the-Delaware-River-Basin-is-Critical-to-Protect-Our-Water"">a de factomoratorium on fracking</a> in the Basin. The DRBC wrote draft regulations banning fracking in 2011 but held off on finalizing them, citing the need for more information on the potential harmful environmental impacts.</p><p>In the intervening years, New York State prohibited fracking and issued a final environmental impact statement in 2015 detailing the significant risks fracking poses to water resources.In 2016, the US EPA published a report on the significant water and health impacts associated with fracking.In 2017, DRBC finally sent the draft regulations, which banned hydraulic fracturing and included regulations governing fracking-related interbasin water transfers and the treatment and disposal of fracking-related wastewater, out for public comment.

A Breath of Fresh Air: Two Steps (and Hopefully More) Forward on Environmental Justice and Water Protection,2/19/2021,"<p><em>The United States has transitioned to the new Biden Administration that offers a stark departure on national environmental policy that could have profound impacts on Pennsylvania. After years of handouts and rollbacks to polluters, the Biden Administration is offering a hopeful opportunity to restore protections for clean air and clean water. The new Administration is also presenting renewed vigor to tackle the biggest environmental challenges of our time: mitigating climate change, addressing inequality and environmental injustices, and advancing a national economy that creates good-paying jobs while not destroying our environment. In this blog series-A Breath of Fresh Air-PennFuture experts discuss their hope, opportunities, and uncertainty during this historic shift in national policy.</em></p><p>The Trump administration had rolled back over 100 different environmental rules, regulations, or policies -an exhausting catalog of actions entirely disregarding health and the environment.Simply undoing the rollbacks would be a start at putting us where we were four years ago. This start is just that -a start.Environmentalists have much higher hopes.</p><p>Another entry in this blog series will focus on the issue of energy and the Clean Power Plan.Of course, given the magnitude and intersectional nature of the climate crisis, climate issues should overlay and interact with nearly everything the Biden administration does.So somewhat artificially setting aside federal energy policy and other more directly climate-focused issues, this post focuses on two areas -using environmental reviews to promote environmental justice and protection of clean water, on which the Biden administration has already started to undo the anti-environmental legacy of the past four years and where further progress is hopefully on its way.</p><p>First, the Trump administration had viewed the National Environmental Policy Act (""NEPA""), which requires review and consideration of impacts and alternatives for all major federal actions affecting human health and the environment, as nothing more than a roadblock to construction.The Biden administration has a chance to not only reinforce the review and public participation mandates of NEPA, but to use it to enshrine principles of environmental justice into law.Because many of the Trump-era rollbacks were done via executive order, President Biden can and indeed has already undone them in the same manner.</p><p>For example, <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/"">President Biden revoked Trump-era executive orders</a> which eliminated federal guidance on review of greenhouse gas emissions and directed federal agencies to rescind the parts of their review processes that allegedly might impede energy production, particularly from oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy resources.He also revoked an order which imposed an unrealistic two-year completion date for all environmental impact statements regardless of the nature or complexity of the project.</p><p>President Biden's <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/"">executive order also directs</a> the Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Management and Budget to ""take steps"" toward ensuring that federal infrastructure investment reduces climate pollution, requiring federal permitting decisions to consider the effects of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and accelerating the deployment of clean energy and transmission projects.</p><p>NEPA, and its mandate for review and consideration of impacts,provides a legal opportunity to center environmental justice considerations and evaluate the impacts of proposed development on communities -including communities of color and tribal communities -that are already disproportionately bearing environmental burdens. President Biden has created within the Council for Environmental Quality, the office responsible for NEPA, the position of senior director for environmental justice <a href=""https://aldianews.com/articles/politics/joe-biden-adds-environmental-trailblazer-cecilia-martinez-his-climate-team/62115"">and has appointed Cecilia Martinez</a>, an environmental justice expert and advocate. Using NEPA and the CEQ is one method; advocates should continue to push the Biden administration to incorporate environmental justice considerations into decision-making throughout government.</p><p>Second, one of President Biden's <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/?fbclid=IwAR2RHPxkppcPEFTkwki83rQ0EMKVmWlFxLACGNfNbBnQN4rmbeL4D8iu98c"">first day executive orders covers</a> the Trump Dirty Water Rule (otherwise known as the ""Navigable Waters Protection Rule"").The Dirty Water Rule <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Submits-Comments-Opposing-the-Dirty-Water-Rule-Engages-More-Than-1400-Citizens-to-Do-the-Same"">was one of the largest rollbacks</a> of Clean Water Act protections in history and removed federal jurisdiction over an enormous amount of waterways and wetlands.The Dirty Water Rule was a rollback of the Waters of the United States rule, which had expanded and clarified federal jurisdiction over many of those same waterways, enacted during President Obama's term.</p><p>The Dirty Water Rule was finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency and became law in 2020.Principles of administrative law mean that new leadership at the EPA can't simply undo the Dirty Waters Rule without a new rulemaking; instead, President Biden announced that the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers (both of which have responsibility for administering the regulation) will review the rule, presumably in preparation for enacting an entirely new regulation.</p><p>The Dirty Water Rule is also being challenged through litigation; if a court invalidates the rule or sends it back to the EPA for further consideration, then that also provides an opportunity for the Biden EPA to essentially start again.Expanded federal jurisdiction over waters and wetlands is essential to consistent protection of waters as well as consistency for stakeholders regarding what rules apply.It is inevitable that any action by the Biden EPA will be challenged in court, and so this is an issue to which environmentalists must keep paying close attention and continue to speak up for protection of our waters.</p><p>It's not enough to take our laws back to where they were before - environmental justice and protection of clean water requires that we take the opportunity to move forward towards a cleaner and healthier environment for all.</p>",Community; Environment,"Jessica O'Neill, Senior Attorney"
A Breath of Fresh Air: Reason for Optimism for Lake Erie,2/12/2021,"<p>Great Lakes communities have reason for optimism under the new Biden administration. Among the many issues the administration plans to tackle are climate change, racial inequities, and aging infrastructure. Bipartisan interest in infrastructure upgrades across the U.S. is especially encouraging because these investments will not only generate family-sustaining jobs but they can also launch the U.S. into a cleaner and more resilient future.</p><p>The Great Lakes are the largest surface freshwater system in the world and Pennsylvania's Erie County runs along the southern border of Lake Erie. Lake Erie has already seen increased harmful algal blooms and decreased ice coverage over the past few decades. Erie was also named as the 8th fastest warming city in the country <a href=""https://www.climatecentral.org/news/report-american-warming-us-heats-up-earth-day"">by Climate Central.</a> Climatic changes in this region will have far reaching effects given the importance of tourism, fishing, and agriculture to the region's economy. These impacts include longer growing seasons but increased frequencies of drought and flood conditions, as well as increased incidences of <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/climate-change-and-harmful-algal-blooms"">harmful algal blooms</a> and <a href=""https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/invasive-alien-species-and-climate-change"">invasive species</a>.</p><p>The Biden administration's quick, decisive actions and <a href=""https://www.pri.org/stories/2021-02-10/biden-vows-take-whole-government-approach-climate-change"">""whole government approach""</a> have the potential to put the United States back on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, upgrade infrastructure to make it more energy efficient, and put us on track for a more sustainable future. Efforts toward energy efficiency and renewable energy are likely to continue Pennsylvania's trend, with <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/08/20/report-clean-energy-jobs-among-fastest-growing-in-state-from-2017-2019/"">clean energy jobs among the fastest growing</a> in the state. Additionally, efforts to make homes more energy efficient will lower energy bills, which will have increased positive impact on low-income families who <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/01/f58/WIP-Energy-Burden_final.pdf"">pay a larger portion of their income toward energy bills</a> than families with higher incomes.</p><p>The Biden administration also promises to upgrade America's infrastructure, including everything from roads to drinking water supply. This would be a major boon for Great Lakes regional economies, marginalized communities, and the environment if conducted in an equitable, sustainable manner. Biden's Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, recognized that ""misguided policies can reinforce racial inequities"" as has been demonstrated <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/defeating-the-legacy-of-highways-rammed-through-poor-neighborhoods/2016/03/28/ffcfb5ae-f2a1-11e5-a61f-e9c95c06edca_story.html"">in highway projects across the country.</a> Having someone in office who understands this is a step in the right direction that will hopefully trickle down into more equitable transportation decision-making.</p><p>Among the infrastructure upgrades that we hope to see are more natural and nature-based stormwater projects, also called <a href=""/what-is-green-stormwater-infrastructure"">green stormwater infrastructure.</a> These features are often overlooked when municipalities develop plans to upgrade stormwater and address flooding issues, but they have been shown to be as effective and less expensive than traditional stormwater infrastructure.</p><p>They also have added benefits like adding green space, providing habitat for native flora and fauna, filtering water pollutants, slowing runoff, and sequestering carbon dioxide. If implemented on a broad scale, these green stormwater features can help protect and restore water quality across the Great Lakes and make communities more resilient to extreme precipitation events and flooding that are <a href=""https://toolkit.climate.gov/regions/great-lakes"">already increasing due to climate change.</a></p><p>The new administration's plans are ambitious, which is exactly what this country needs right now to pull us out of the economic recession and job loss caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We need strong action to address racial inequities that have always existed but have received renewed attention due to the social unrest that came from the unnecessary deaths of several Black Americans in 2020. We also saw that people of color have experienced disproportionate impacts from the pandemic, further highlighting the need for action. President Biden has already put together <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/president-biden-takes-office/2021/02/05/963837953/biden-pledged-historic-cabinet-diversity-heres-how-his-nominees-stack-up"">a diverse cabinet</a> and issued <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2021/01/29/956012329/hope-and-skepticism-as-biden-promises-to-address-environmental-racism"">an executive order to address environmental racism</a>, both of which are promising steps toward more equitable federal policies.</p><p>While there is much to be celebrated at the beginning of this new administration, there is much work to be done and a divided nation to heal. No administration can accomplish everything they set out to do but this one is off to a good start. Hopefully, local momentum for better inclusion and more equitable policies will add to the federal initiatives and move the country toward a more prosperous, sustainable, and equitable future for everyone and a vibrant future for the Great Lakes region.</p>",Climate; Community; Environment,"Sarah Bennett, Campaign Manager for Clean Water Advocacy"

In this blog series-A Breath of Fresh Air-PennFuture experts discuss their hope, opportunities, and uncertainty during this historic shift in national policy.</em><br /><br /> The first week of President Biden's administration galvanized conservationists, environmentalists, and environmental justice activists.With the stroke of a pen, the federal government promised to champion science and prioritize climate change.Ultimately, the series of executive orders signed by President Biden that focused on the environment renewed faith in a system that, for four years, seemed bent on careening us towards climate catastrophe.Many of us breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Organizers and activists are exhausted.Playing defense against an anti-environment juggernaut for four years left us burned out.So, it's only natural for us to take a break and let the new administration take over for a while.And that's what I'm afraid of: relinquishing control is not strategy; it is desperation.</p><p>Instead, organizers and activists need to expand our reach and deepen relationships throughout our communities. We need to escape our echo chambers.We need to form coalitions and build networks of communication.White-led organizations and coalitions need to share power.We need to develop alliances with the working class.This is not the time for rest.We have work to do.</p><p>In order to successfully build coalitions across class lines, we need a message that puts an end to the division between labor and the environment.Mining, drilling, processing, and pipeline jobs won't just disappear into the ether.A parallel economy - the Green Economy - is emerging.As we transition to renewables, opportunities for labor will abound.Yes, the jobs - and the skills necessary to perform them - will be different.</p><p>Training will be required.But there will be opportunities for labor.And they will likely be safer and healthier for workers, communities, and the planet.In a state where some legislators consistently ignore science and pit labor against the environment, I believe that a change in the national conversation may very well - dare I say trickle down - to the local level.</p><p>We've been here before with coal, an industry dying before our eyes, still refusing to fade away in favor of cleaner, renewable options.Now, we're forced to witness the end of the fracked gas industry, only a couple of decades after it ripped through our mountains, poisoned our streams, and destroyed our infrastructure.It is time to break the cycle of environmental abuse levied upon this state by the fossil fuel industry in all of its iterations.</p><p>We have the opportunity to rise up as a leader in renewable energy and lift up the working class which has kept the lights on for so long by serving in the mines, gas fields, and oil refineries.It is time to give back by providing new jobs, skills, and opportunities.As the new administration says, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/30/joe-biden-climate-change-action?fbclid=IwAR0iPREAzsjbRwQILFKGtHFZgIfQjvsrcLSZiRhPDguxD72josjUozCcA1M"">""When I think of climate change I think of jobs.""</a> Organizers at the local level need to embrace that slogan.</p><p>It is up to us to build the relationships necessary to see each other as partners, not as adversaries. It is up to us to agree that the climate crisis is worthy enough a foe to link arms.It is up to us to fight for the future of our families, communities, country, and planet instead of political points.</p><p>If Pennsylvanians could agree that the environment is one of the most salient issues in our commonwealth, consider the injustices we could confront:environmental racism, the death of the fossil fuel industry that left behind workers whose ancestors kept the lights on for generations, the failing health of our nation caused by pollution and environmental degradation.As organizers, it is up to us to lay the groundwork for progress.</p><p>The advent of a new administration does not allow for rest; in contrast, it demands a kind of sortie.Environmentalists, conservationists, and EJ activists must now go on the offensive. It is time to battle for the future. We've got the opportunity to make real, tangible progress if we coalesce and fight.

A Welcomed Shift in Philadelphia’s Approach to Infrastructure Financing,2/2/2021,"<p>Last month Governor Wolf <a href=""https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/Pennvest-details.aspx?newsid=61"">announced $178 million in investments</a> for water infrastructure projects in 11 counties with funds from <a href=""https://www.pennvest.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx"">Pennsylvania's Infrastructure Investment Fund (PENNVEST)</a>. Philadelphia received the largest award of any applicant: $106 million of the investments will contribute to the goals of the <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> program - the city's combined sewer overflow compliance program. The announcement represents a welcomed shift in the city's approach to infrastructure financing, and one we'd like to see the water department utilize more in the future.</p><p>PENNVEST is a low-cost financing program that provides assistance to the communities and citizens of Pennsylvania by funding sewer, stormwater and drinking water projects. PENNVEST was established in 1988 through the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority Act to administer and finance federal programs known as the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF), the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF), and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). CWSRF and DWSRF were established as part of the Water Quality Act of 1987. PENNVEST also finances, through the issuance of special obligation revenue bonds, water management, solid waste disposal, sewage treatment and pollution control projects undertaken by or on behalf of private entities.</p><p>Recently, concerns have arisen from within the water department about the rising cost of Philadelphia's <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> program, which is financed bya stormwater charge on water rates and taxpayer dollars. PENNVEST provides municipalities with a low interest rate alternative to pursuing financing through the private market. This allows for municipalities to avoid having to make large increases to water rates or taxes to finance their water infrastructure investments.</p><p>In 2019 PennFuture, along with partners at Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia, Natural Resources Defense Council, Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, and Friends of the Wissahickon, released <a href=""/common-agenda"">A Common Green Stormwater Infrastructure Agenda for Philadelphia</a>.The Common Agenda offered a series of recommended policy solutions for Philadelphia's Mayor and City Council to consider to ensure the long term success of <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em>.</p><p>One recommended solution is that the city ""take full advantage of all available state and federal programs that provide grants and low-cost financing for municipal infrastructure improvement. This includes programs like PENNVEST's Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which are specifically for water infrastructure, as well as programs focused on transportation, community development, or other projects that can be leveraged to include GSI improvements."" (The Common Agenda, Pg. 12).</p><p>PENNVEST funding is offered to a variety of programs, including <a href=""https://www.pennvest.pa.gov/Information/Funding-Programs/Pages/Green-Initiatives.aspx"">green initiatives that promote and encourage environmental responsibility</a> in communities that are creative and innovative with green solutions for water quality management. The Philadelphia Water Department was awarded PENNVEST funding for two projects. Both projects will contribute to cleaner streams and rivers in Philadelphia and maintain an affordable water rate for ratepayers.</p><p>A portion of the PENNVEST award <a href=""https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/534811498/tartaglione-announces-6-7-million-in-state-financing-to-reduce-wastewater-overflows-in-lawncrest"">will provide $6.7 million in green investments</a> in the Lawncrest neighborhood of lower Northeast Philadelphia. These green infrastructure projects include tree trenches, bumpouts, and stormwater trees that will reduce the quantity of stormwater pollution entering the streams and rivers surrounding Philadelphia.</p><p>The neighborhood of Lawncrest is also considered an Environmental Justice (EJ) Area. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection defines an EJ Area as ""any census tract where 20 percent or more individuals live at or below the federal poverty level and/or 30 percent or more of the population identifies as a non-white minority, based on data for the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal guidelines for poverty."" In addition to reducing stormwater pollution and greening the neighborhood, this green investment will contribute to cooling the neighborhood and reversing the Urban Heat Island effect.</p><p>Philadelphia also received <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/pennsylvania-philadelphia-water-department-sewer-loan-upgrade-northeast-plant-20210126.html"">a $100 million loan to construct</a> a preliminary treatment facility. The facility will reroute wastewater from entering the combined sewer system and install new screening and grit removal systems. The project will have the capacity to treat 300 million gallons per day and will reduce the amount of combined sewer overflows entering the Delaware River. Both of these significant infrastructure investments will contribute to the <em>Green City, Clean Waters'</em> goal to reduce the amount of polluted stormwater overflows discharging into the creeks, streams, and rivers in and around Philadelphia by 85 percent by 2036.</p><p>It's refreshing to see the Philadelphia Water Department pursue innovative approaches towards financing and fixing very old issues with the city's aging infrastructure. <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> was an innovative and unique solution to combined sewer overflow pollution. The program put Philadelphia on the map as a national leader in green infrastructure. And now, as the program reaches its 10 year anniversary amidst a global pandemic, Philadelphia must once again demonstrate innovation and leadership in stormwater infrastructure.</p>",,Lena Smith
PennFuture joins with the Philadelphia Coalition for Affordable Communities,1/26/2021,"<p>At the start of 2021, PennFuture became an official member of the <a href=""http://phillyaffordablecommunities.org/"">Philadelphia Coalition for Affordable Communities</a>. The coalition, led by the <a href=""https://www.wcrpphila.org/"">Women's Community Revitalization Project</a>,launched in 2005 through the ""Development without Displacement"" campaign to ensure that as the city's neighborhoods recover and thrive, individuals and families from all income levels benefit.</p><p>Over the years, the coalition has been advocating for better policies, more funding and more land for affordable housing, as well as funding for childcare and resources to address community needs. These campaigns have resulted in notable victories including the creation of the Philadelphia Housing Trust Fund, The Land Bank, and funding for affordable housing. This year the coalition will be launching its Land Justice Campaign.</p><p>We are proud to join the coalition in striving for increased land justice and affordable housing. Our Philadelphia work is focused on elevating nature-based solutions to stormwater pollution by elevating the importance of green stormwater infrastructure and the preservation and increase of green space with elected officials and communities.</p><p>Philadelphia's <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/water/sustainability/greencitycleanwaters/Pages/default.aspx""><em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> program</a> has put the city on the map for being the first city in the country to implement green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) at a citywide scale to reduce stormwater pollution. To date, Philadelphia has constructed 1,000 greened acres (a good start in reaching their goal of 10,000 greened acres by 2036) that are reducing stormwater pollution and resulting in cleaner water in our local rivers and streams. But even before the city's <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> program, communities and residents were reducing stormwater pollution by preserving land for community gardens and open space.</p><p>When <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> was first initiated, Philadelphia was still struggling to recover from decades of declining population and urban blight. The program was chosen, in part, because of the co-benefits associated with greening neighborhoods intended to address many of the intersecting crises. It was also the most cost-effective. Philadelphia was facing, and continues to struggle with today, gun violence, blight, the urban heat island effect, poverty, and job loss.</p><p><em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> has had many successes over the years. To date, <a href=""https://gsipartners.sbnphiladelphia.org/the-economic-social-and-environmental-case-for-green-city-clean-waters-an-update/"">the program is producing $4 billion in total economic impact for Philadelphia</a>, including an average of 1,160 jobs annually. In 2018 the program reduced crime by nearly nine percent and saved the city $50 million annually in avoided health-related costs attributed to access to open space.</p><p>Now, nearly ten years after the initial launch of <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em>, Philadelphia is a different kind of city. Philadelphia is becoming a more desirable place to live. Development has increased in many neighborhoods and property values are rising. But these improvements have also had some negative impacts on our communities. As affordable, accessible homes are becoming out of reach for most Philadelphians, community open spaces and gardens are quickly being lost to profit-driven development. Community gardens and farms have been places where people gather, sources of affordable nutrition, and naturally manage stormwater.</p><p>While this development is critical for improving Philadelphia's neighborhoods and the construction of private green stormwater infrastructure projects, for many Philadelphians who have been preserving open space and investing in their communities for years, it means being forced out of their communities. Preserving housing and land affordability in gentrifying neighborhoods will ensure that those who are committed to and invested in Philadelphia's communities can afford to stay.</p><p>On Thursday, PennFuture will join the Philadelphia Coalition for Affordable Housing as it launches the Land Justice Campaign, which seeks to address the city's housing and food affordability crises by transfering city owned vacant land to groups that will put the land back to use and ensure permanent affordability and community control.</p><p>The campaign intends to expand opportunities to create Community Land Trusts (CLTs) within the city. CLTs are nonprofit, community-based organizations that are committed to permanent stewardship of land and the permanent affordability of housing and other uses upon its lands. They are one way to achieve permanent accessible affordable and community control in neighborhoods facing displacement.</p><p>We are proud to stand among the members of the coalition in seeking community-led solutions to Philadelphia's affordability and land justice challenges.</p>",Climate; Community; Environment,Lena Smith

A commitment to reverse or reinstate an astounding number of environmental rollbacks and repeals from the prior administration.</p><p>And that was just Day 1.</p><p>President Joseph Biden hasn't been shy about his determination to tackle one of the most pressing issues of our time. Speaking from the Oval Office on his first night as president, Biden said his administration will <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/climate/biden-paris-climate-agreement.html"">""combat climate change in a way we have not before.""</a></p><p>Though Biden's actions will ultimately speak louder than his words, his first day in office was already a stark departure from the deregulation and polluter-first policies of the Trump administration, which repealed or otherwise rolled back more than 100 environmental rules and regulations.</p><p>In case you needed a reminder, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html"">the numbers are staggering</a>: 30 rule reversals for air pollution, 19 on drilling and extraction, 16 for protecting wildlife and animals, and 9 for water pollution, among others. All told, 112 rules meant to keep us, our environment, and living species safe from pollution and degradation, wiped off the books or watered down over the last four years.</p><p>Trump didn't stop at deregulation.

Anything less from either side of the political spectrum is unacceptable.</p><p>With that said, it's hard not to feel optimistic on the dawn of this new administration. Even while running for president, Biden's platform <a href=""https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/look-biden-s-climate-and-environment-roster"">included the most ambitious climate action plan in history</a>, with a needed and dedicated focus on environmental justice issues.</p><p>Since being elected in November, Biden has unveiled a climate-first cabinet <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biden-names-john-kerry-climate-envoy/"">and even created a new position</a> in nominating former Secretary of State John Kerry as a ""special presidential envoy on climate change."" He also tapped Obama-era EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to start a new White House office on climate policy.</p><p>According to the New York Times, Biden is building a veritable ""nerve center"" for climate issues and is overseeing <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/climate/biden-climate-change.html"">""the largest team of climate change experts ever assembled in the White House.""</a></p><p>So on this, the second full day of a new administration, we are hopeful for a new era, but we are not yet satisfied or content. We are eager to see what comes next, and how PennFuture might engage with or otherwise work alongside this new administration to advance commonsense policies and regulations that bring us closer to a world without a climate crisis.</p><p>At minimum, this new administration is a breath of fresh air, but time will tell as to its true impact on the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the climate we all rely on for survival.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jared Stonesifer, Director of Media Relations"
In the Midst of a Democracy Emergency,1/19/2021,"<p>The United States, and by extension Pennsylvania, is in the midst of a democracy emergency.</p><p>Our public institutions are weak, the image of a stable American republic is in tatters, and basic tenets of our constitution-the ability for all citizens to freely vote, for those votes to be fairly counted, and results of the election to lead to a peaceful transition of power-has been undermined.</p><p>While PennFuture remains, first and foremost, a beacon for environmental leadership and protection in Pennsylvania, we would not be true to our mission if we didn't stand up and emphatically oppose efforts to undercut the democracy we require to ensure clean air, clean water, abundant green spaces, and a stable climate. We stand with all of civil society against the violent sedition, conspiracy theories, and fomenting of hate that has gripped our communities and politics.</p><p>PennFuture has now <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/insurrectionaction"">weighed in against elected officials</a> who have breached the trust of the people.Elected officials in our state <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/mastrianoalert"">are propagating and participating in the lie</a> that Pennsylvania's November 2020 election was fraudulent. President Donald Trump has taken that lie to the point of inciting riot, mayhem and insurrection against American Democracy on January 6, 2021.</p><p>When we crafted <a href=""/News-PennFuture-statement-regarding-violent-insurrection-at-US-Capitol"">our media statement</a> around the insurrection, we knew the statement would be different, and the focus would be different, because this moment in time is one of the most appalling and dangerous in our history.</p><p>This moment also lays bare the interconnectedness of our frail democracy with the systemic environmental injustices holding back countless communities around the Commonwealth. The gross racial double standard applied by law enforcement was egregiously on display on January 6. So was the evidence of white supremacists among President Trump's supporters, and the overtly racist aspects of Trumps doctrine of ""American Carnage.""</p><p>The trauma felt by people of color in the aftermath of January 6, simply put, cannot be shared by white America.People of color in this country have not lived the same American experience lived by whites because this country's original sin of slavery, inequality and race relations still have not been reckoned with.Now we endeavor to attempt that reckoning, and January 6 is the latest manifestation of how hard this will and needs to be. We must try harder to open and hold fast to a space for people of color to speak in this moment.</p><p>Our country is balancing on a razor edge.On one side is unity; on the other side is violence, and deeper division. Since the November election, I have struggled with the question of how PennFuture can do its work in a state so deeply divided.Racism divides us, and we are taking imperfect steps as an organization to deal with this. The partisan divide is fueling so many problems and we are grateful that many lawmakers talk to us and listen to our concerns.</p><p>There is an urban and rural divide.Over the years, I have done a lot of conservation work in more rural communities of our state.I know at one time there were strongly held and shared values around land, air, water and wildlife across the political and geographic spectrum- will we ever share those values again?</p><p>There is also a divide between what our state Constitution says and how it iscarried out by elected officials, residents, and corporations. Our mission is tethered to the Pennsylvania Constitution, specifically Article 1, Section 27, the Environmental Rights Amendment that states:</p><p><em>The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.Pennsylvania's public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come.As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.</em></p><p>Bluntly, we have made little progress in ensuring this guarantee is the law of the land.</p><p>PennFuture's theory of change relies on the state and nation having in place a majority of elected officials who are pro-environment and who share that value with our organization.For those majorities to occur, our values as an organization need to be shared with voters, participating in an intact democracy.</p><p>PennFuture's Civic Engagement program-<a href=""https://www.democracyforall-pennfuture.com/"">Democracy for All</a>-reaches out to those voters or those eligible to vote and endeavors to open our organization to those voices, particularly in communities of color, but the trust gap is real.</p><p>The democracy emergency is real; fraught race relations are real; so is the climate emergency, and the public health emergency in our communities unjustly burdened with pollution. As the country transitions from an unapologetically anti-environmental and anti-regulatory administration to the Biden administration, one that blessedly already is taking major steps to affirm the seriousness of global climate change and the need to transition without further delay to a cleaner energy, you can expect PennFuture to continue to speak up about these interconnected emergencies.</p><p>On a personal note, as a lifelong activist, silence from the advocacy organization I came to lead was not an option after January 6.I've offered my assurance about our mission, and rationale about why we must focus where we are.</p><p>At the end of the day, though, it must be said that we act because it is simply the right thing to do.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Jacquelyn Bonomo, PennFuture President and CEO; Matthew Stepp, Vice President and Chief of Staff, PennFuture"
The Growing Danger of Pipelines Our Safety Regulations Overlook,1/6/2021,"<p>In a November 2019 presentation, John Gale, Director of Standards and Rulemaking at the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), called gathering lines <a href=""http://pstrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Gale-Presentation.pdf"">""the next big thing"" in pipeline safety</a>. This certainly rings true in Pennsylvania.</p><p>After just one week in operation, Energy Transfer's 24-inch diameter gathering pipeline ruptured and exploded in Beaver County, taking down a nearby house, six transmission towers, and multiple motor vehicles and burning several acres of trees. Residents of 49 households were forced to evacuate in the 2018 explosion.</p><p>By June 2020, Attorney General Josh Shapiro had released a scathing report on the state's failure to protect its citizens during the fracking boom. The report had eight recommendations, and the regulation of gathering pipelines was third on the list.</p><p>As the report describes, the emergence of fracking dramatically upended the gas industry, swiftly rendering decades of regulations insufficient.The failed regulation of gathering pipelines provides a blistering example.</p><p>Gas pipelines are broken into three main categories: gathering lines, which transport extracted gas to be processed and treated; transmission lines, which transport processed gas over long distances; and distribution lines, which deliver processed gas to homes and businesses. The PHMSA sets minimum regulations for pipelines and certifies state agents - usually the Public Utility Commission - for enforcement.</p><p>While transmission and distribution lines are generally held to higher standards, gathering lines are subject to a patchwork of regulations that leaves an estimated 439,000 miles of pipelines - which, end to end, would wrap around the Earth 17 times - essentially unregulated. These pipelines do not have to be built to standard, marked, or regularly inspected, a regulatory scheme that was devised when gathering lines were considered lower risk because of their comparatively smaller diameter and lower pressure.</p><p>Yet with a dramatic increase in production and more gas to transport, fracked gas companies now operate much larger gathering pipelines under higher pressures. In many instances, these pipelines are indistinguishable from transmission lines, despite being subject to far fewer safety regulations.</p><p>In fact, which regulations apply to gathering lines depend upon both the population density of the surrounding area - a factor which is subject to change over time - and its operating pressure. These confusing standards undervalue the safety of rural residents, preclude community involvement, and complicate enforcement. They also mean that about 95 percent of gathering pipelines in Pennsylvania are not subject to any federal or state safety regulations.</p><p>Pennsylvania needs to streamline and extend its pipeline safety standards by regulating all gathering lines just as we would transmission lines. This means that pipeline companies would be held to a common standard for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of all gathering lines, regardless of their location.</p><p>Gathering lines in urban areas (Class 4 locations) are already subject to most of these rules. This change would extend these safety regulations to pipelines in less densely populated areas, affording peri-urban and rural residents the same level of protection from potential pipeline incidents while simplifying enforcement.</p><p>Regulating gathering pipelines is not the only action necessary to modernize our outdated pipeline safety regulations, but it's an important first step.</p><p>More than 90 percent of voters in Pennsylvania want lawmakers to take the necessary steps to prevent pipeline accidents. We must urge the General Assembly to heed the Attorney General's recommendations and the expressed concerns of voters across the state by regulating all gathering lines exactly as we would transmission lines.</p>",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Emily Persico, Policy Analyst"
Recycling is Exacerbating the Plastic Waste Crisis,1/4/2021,"<p>On November 25th, 2020, Pennsylvania became the ninth state in the nation to pass <a href=""https://nextpittsburgh.com/latest-news/the-advanced-recycling-bill-just-passed-by-the-pa-house-would-harm-the-environment-says-new-report-heres-why/"">so-called ""advanced recycling"" legislation</a>.</p><p>Coined by the American Chemistry Council, the term encompasses processes that transform plastic waste into their component parts using heat and pressure. Because 99 percent of all plastics are made from oil and fracked gas, the resulting product is most often a fossil fuel.</p><p>The legislation redefines plastic-to-fuel operations as ""recycling"" under state solid waste law, loosening regulations for plastic-burning businesses and potentially paving the way for them to take advantage of future clean energy funding. All this bodes poorly for the residents of Pennsylvania, who can expect more air pollution and an increased reliance on single-use plastic.</p><p>The nascent industry is already descending upon our state, using Pennsylvania residents as guinea pigs as they test out new methods and processes. International Recycling Group <a href=""https://www.goerie.com/story/business/2020/08/17/100-million-recycling-plant-planned-for-erie/113341576/"">is planning to sort and process ""recycled"" plastics in Erie County</a> for use as a fuel and reactant in the steel-making process. Meanwhile, Agilyx Corporation <a href=""https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/agilyx-delta-air-monroe-plastic-scrap-fuel/"">has plans to revert ""recycled"" plastics into jet fuel</a> for Delta Airlines, expanding a petrochemical hub in an already overburdened community outside of Philadelphia.</p><p>""As we advance the number and types of products we can make from waste plastics, this project marks the first truly commercial-scale facility that will advance the new plastics economy,"" says Agilyx CEO Joe Vaillancourt.</p><p>Advanced recycling builds upon a decades-long crusade by the oil and gas industry to undermine the effectiveness of recycling. As public skepticism of plastic started turning into local bans on non-recyclable plastics in the 80s and 90s, the oil and gas industry realized that they had to <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/822597631/plastic-wars-three-takeaways-from-the-fight-over-the-future-of-plastics"">buy the public's trust in recycling</a> to keep plastic in the marketplace.</p><p>Yet an effective recycling system would be at odds with the industry, which <a href=""https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2020/09/13/381750/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled/"">makes $400 billion each year</a> turning fossil fuels into virgin plastics. So while they spent millions of dollars on ads and public relations campaigns to promote recycling, they also quietly celebrated the fact that low-quality recycled plastics could never compete with virgin plastics made from cheap oil and gas.</p><p>Now, the oil and gas industry is taking our trust - our carefully cleaned and sorted plastic recyclables - and burning it.</p><p>Advanced recycling businesses will come to rely upon single-use plastics as feedstock, further aiding oil and gas companies in their ultimate goal of <a href=""https://e360.yale.edu/features/the-plastics-pipeline-a-surge-of-new-production-is-on-the-way"">ramping up plastic production by threefold</a> in the next 30 years.</p><p>Pennsylvania will bear the brunt of this too. We have an overabundance of fracked gas - so much so that industry executives were <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2020/12/29/pennsylvania-rig-count-2020.html?ana=e_me_prem&j=90544016&t=Morning&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT1Raa056WXpOV1k1WVdGaCIsInQiOiJVUFc5RUtUZitaWXFmZ2tJZG9YazM4bkNJV3RTWE9CMlFxTUliMlN2clBveEtHVkNsNDBNaWh4c0dDZU1DOW1QK3RaczF6a2x5Nmt5NWZKeVpvbFh2VEM2SzNGMjR5NjZ3eWpjZlRwaG4xXC9La0dvcUFtRkhKMnJWUUZ1UUN2bDRwQzhyVzVzamFEVFRhOHg0cmZEZ2pnPT0ifQ%3D%3D"">forced to curb production this year</a>. Eager to find a use for their unwanted product, elected officials are doling out billions of taxpayer dollars to attract companies that would convert Pennsylvania fracked gas into petrochemicals like plastics and fertilizers. Shell was the first company <a href=""https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/shell-cracks-pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-tax-code"">to cash in on the prize</a>. They will not necessarily be the last.</p><p>More fracking, more plastic production, more plastic burning. Is this the solution to our plastics waste crisis?</p><p>Plastic recycling is exactly what it was always meant to be: a pseudo-solution to the plastics crisis that assuages consumer guilt just enough to keep plastic production churning. Decades into this distraction, we are finding plastics in <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/youre-literally-eating-microplastics-how-you-can-cut-down-exposure-to-them/2019/10/04/22ebdfb6-e17a-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html"">our food</a>, <a href=""https://news.wsu.edu/2020/03/13/invisible-plastics-water/"">our water</a>, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/climate/airborne-plastic-pollution.html"">our air</a>.
