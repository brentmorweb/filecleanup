Ready for 2021,12/28/2020,"<p>Early on in 2020, even after a very successful mid-March rally against petrochemical subsidies in the state Capitol that was organized by the PennFuture team and supported by many partners, the pandemic and recession gave me serious doubts that PennFuture would be able to carry on our mission, let alone remain an essential force for environmental protection.</p>

<p>As I reflect on the past and difficult year, that feeling couldn&rsquo;t have been further from what actually transpired &ndash; PennFuture distinguished itself as unparalleled in statewide environmental advocacy.</p>

<p>Sure, the fact that the legislature remained in session, and was sufficiently emboldened to attempt many bad things, helped, and cemented PennFuture&rsquo;s essential role in 2020 as a watchdog of the legislature and of polluters. But we also did so much more: defeated over 50 bad pieces of legislation designed to roll back previously hard-won environmental protections; seven legal actions taken; three major policy reports published; a virtual campaign to protect Pocono headwater streams that yielded almost 2 million social media posts and advocate-produced video content; and 800,000 voters or prospective voters civically engaged. </p>

<p>Our communications output was exhaustive: literally hundreds of media placements; the production of 15 issues of our lockdown inspired early-warning publication &quot;The Bark&quot;;and a full on counter-offensive of published content counteringthe many false narratives the fracked gas, petrochemicaland plastics industries spew regularly.</p>

<p>The year wasn&rsquo;t without its extreme difficulties.The ongoing racism so brutally exposed by Black Lives Matters; the health end economic disparities exacted upon communities of color by COVID and its recession; the attempted robbery of the presidential election; and the deep divisions that define us.</p>

<p>So 2021 must be a year to grapple with these realities, while we seek ways to reset society&rsquo;s desire for clean air, water and a healthy climate.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say enough about the extraordinary talent, energy and commitment of our staff team and the long list of great work not mentioned here.We are fortunate to have the encouragement and good counsel provided by our board of volunteerleaders.</p>

<p>With the help of readers, advocates and supporters like all of you, when 2021 arrives, PennFuture will be ready.<br />

2019-2020 Legislative Wrap-Up & 2021 Preview:  Where Does the PA General Assembly Stand on Our Environment?,12/16/2020,"<p>With the close of the legislative session in Harrisburg at the end of Novembercame significant victories for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental protection, as a handful of bills were halted thanks to our work in the Capitol, and thanks to the many citizens who took action by contacting their elected officials.</p>

<p>This would not have been possible without the advocacy and hard work from PennFuture staff, members, supporters, and partners across the environmental and conservation community in Pennsylvania. Through action alert emails that engaged citizens with their elected officials, in-district constituent meetings with members of the General Assembly, calls to offices, sign-on letters with partner organizations and coalitions, and multiple lobby days, our presence and direct opposition to these bills truly had an impact.</p>

<p>While advancing proactive, offensive, good environmental legislation remains a challenge in Harrisburg, PennFuture and partners killed, blocked, and bottled-up a host of anti-environmental and pro-fossil fuel bills and policies in the recent previous legislative session. Below, please find a summary of the good, bad and ugly bills we engaged with over this last legislative session.</p>

<p><u><strong>Defensive Victories</strong></u>:</p>

<p>In terms of &quot;regulatory reform,&rdquo; which is really just another term for&ldquo;rollbacks,&rdquo; PennFuture and partners killed a number of dangerous bills in the General Assembly, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HB 430 (Legislative blocking/killing regulationsvia concurrent resolution)</li>
	<li>HB 414/HB 509/SB 252 (allowing for &lsquo;third-party permit review&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 762/SB 253 (&lsquo;Regulatory Compliance Advisor&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 507/ HB 806/SB 5 (Legislative approval of &lsquo;economically significantregulations&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 827/SB 305 (undermining the Delaware River Basin Commission witheminent domain and requiring &lsquo;just compensation&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 828 (Regulatoryrollback for unconventional drilling: siting, boreholes, water)</li>
	<li>HB 1055/SB 251 (Office of the Repealer)</li>
	<li>HB 1105 (Energize Pennsylvania package: &lsquo;consolidated standards permit&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 414/1106 (Energize Pennsylvania package: &lsquo;deemed approval&rsquo; of permits)</li>
	<li>HB 1107 (Energize Pennsylvania package: &lsquo;PA Permitting Commission&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 1874/SB 703 (Amending the Regulatory Review Act for more legislative control of theIndependent Regulatory Review Commission)</li>
	<li>HB 2025/SB 950 (Requiring legislative approval of RGGI) - <em>Governor Wolf vetoed</em></li>
	<li>HB 2416/SB 327 (Regulatory tolling during COVID-19 emergency declaration)</li>
	<li>SB 323/887 (pipeline protest bill; &lsquo;critical infrastructure protection act&rsquo;; liability fees paid by protestors)</li>
	<li>SB 619 (attempt to eviscerate PA&rsquo;s Clean Streams Law)</li>
	<li>SB 726/727 (Cutting scope, powers, membership of Environmental Hearing Board)</li>
	<li>SB 790/HB 1635 (rolling back conventional drilling standards to 1984 levels) - <em>Governor Wolf vetoed</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of fossil fuel subsidies and giveaways, PennFuture and partners killed a number of dangerous bills in the General Assembly, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HB 11/SB 510 (unlimited &amp; open-ended nuclear subsidies with no Tier 1 AEPS increase)</li>
	<li>HB 695 (incentives for waste-to-energy &lsquo;recycling&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 1100 (Energize Pennsylvania package: open-ended subsidy for 30 years at $660B per petrochemicalplant) - <em>Governor Wolf vetoed</em></li>
	<li>HB 1102 (Energize Pennsylvania package: KEEZ/Keystone Energy Enhancement Zones for petrochemicals).</li>
	<li>HB 1392/SB 845 (punitive fees on electric vehicle owners)</li>
	<li>SB 716/717 (Natural Gas development on state lands)</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of raiding environmental protection &amp; conservation in the state&rsquo;s budgets and special funds, PennFuture and partners killed a number of dangerous bills in the General Assembly, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HB 1822 (Putting a freeze on spending out of several environmental special funds)</li>
	<li>HB 1988 (Placing environmental special funds into the state&rsquo;s General Fund)</li>
	<li>HB 2004 (Gives the General Assembly control to allocate funds from special funds)</li>
	<li>SB 1034 (Amending fiscal code to include &ldquo;grant managementoversight&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Offensive Victories:</strong></u></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Harrisburg has offered up few bright spots in terms of legislativeoffensive victories that are pro-environment during this last two-year legislative session, but state lawmakers did a few, great things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Creation of new, innovative &ldquo;Pennsylvania Farm Bill&rdquo; that elevates agricultural conservation work</li>
	<li>Allocated $3M for REAP (Resource Enhancement and Protection Tax Credit)</li>
	<li>Allocated $2M for the Conservation Excellence program at the PA Department of Agriculture</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Challenges:</strong></u></p>

<p>A few terrible pieces of legislation passed through the General Assembly and secured the Governor&rsquo;s signature this year, mostly via nefarious policy riders to the fiscal codes of budget packagesthat PennFuture and partners will continue to fight back against, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HB 732 (petrochemical subsidy to the tune of $670M over 26 years to 4 petrochemical plants)</li>
	<li>HB 2536 (waste coal subsidy by &lsquo;closing the borders&rsquo; for Tier II of AEPS)</li>
	<li>2019&rsquo;s fiscal code (waste coal subsidy for $200M)</li>
	<li>HB 1103 (building out state&rsquo;s PIPE program, increased gas infrastructure)</li>
	<li>Repeal of data reporting requirements outlined by Act 54 for mining operations in the recent 2021 state budget package&rsquo;s fiscal code (former SB 763)</li>
	<li>Termination of Joint Legislative Conservation Commission (JLCC) at the end of 2021 in 2019-2020FY budget</li>
	<li>HB 1808 (promotion of plastics/petrochemicals as &lsquo;recycling&rsquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>What Legislation We Expect to See Next Session (2021-22):</strong></u></p>

<p>Several beneficial bills advancing clean energy, environmental protection and conservation have failed to pass this session, but we will continue to advocate for them next year alongside partners. Here&rsquo;s what to look for in the coming months in terms of the work ahead:</p>

<p><em>Advancing Clean &amp; Renewable Energy</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Moving forward the DEP&rsquo;s &ldquo;Carbon Trading Program&rdquo; through the regulatory process</li>
	<li>Establishingcarbon Cap &amp; Invest programs in Pennsylvania (formerly SB 15/ HB 2586)</li>
	<li>Passing Community Solar legislation (formerly HB 531/SB 705)</li>
	<li>Expanding &amp; modernizing the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS, formerly SB 600/ HB 1195)</li>
	<li>Enacting legislation increasing buildout of infrastructure for electric vehicles (formerly SB 596)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Advancing Environmental Protections &amp; Holding Polluters Accountable</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Closing loopholes on hydraulic fracturing waste (cosponsor memoranda out now from Sen. Muth &amp; Rep. Innamorato)</li>
	<li>Passing legislation implementing recommendations from Attorney General Shapiro&rsquo;s 2020 report on environmental crimes by polluters in hydraulic fracturing</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Advancing Clean Water Legislation</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Setting increased training &amp; application requirements for fertilizer (formerly SB 915)</li>
	<li>Passing the &ldquo;Agriculture Conservation Assistance Program&rdquo; (ACAP - formerly SB 1272), which would give much-needed support to farmers to implement best management practices and conservation work to improve water quality</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Advancing Equity and Funding for Green Stimulus &amp; Recovery</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Advocating that Gov. Wolf is bold in his budget address in early February and advocating for an equitable budget as it moves through the General Assembly this Spring, a continuation of PennFuture&rsquo;s &ldquo;Green Stimulus &amp; Recovery&rdquo; work</li>
	<li>Working with frontline community advocates to pass legislation establishing an &ldquo;Office of Just Transition&rdquo; and legislation giving more teeth to the PA DEP&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Justice coupled with increased interagency coordination and review of justice concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture and partners in the environmental and conservation community will again be busy in defensive work. 2021 is setting up to be a year of more hope and opportunity, but many of the same legislative themes will persist. Pennsylvania legislators will likely take yet another crack at &ldquo;Regulatory Reform&rdquo; legislation such as the &ldquo;Office of the Repealer&rdquo; bill, more legislation attempting to eviscerate the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Clean Streams Law, and more fossil fuel subsidies like therecent waste coal giveaways and the behemoth gifts to the petrochemical industry outlined in the Energize Pennsylvaniaplan.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, we&rsquo;re likely to continue playing defense against austere and draconian budget cuts to our agencies and dedicated funds for environmental protection and conservation.</p>

<p>For now, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and State Senate will return to Harrisburg on January 5th to swear-in new Members of the General Assembly, but the two legislative bodies will likely not be back in full swing (and voting session) until mid-late January. Very soon thereafter, Governor Wolf will introduce his proposed state budget for the 2021-22 fiscal year and agency budget hearings for the Appropriations Committees will begin their work in earnest.</p>

<p>We will continue to advocate for a clean and responsible state budget, track and advance legislation that protects our environment, acton climate, and we will defend against any attacks on our Commonwealth&rsquo;s crucial clean air, water, and natural resource protections.</p>

More Challenges Knocking on Dimock’s Door,12/8/2020,"<p>Dimock has long played the unwelcomed role of ground zero in the fracking crisis in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Early on during the fracking boom, this quiet, rural township in Susquehanna County became notorious for explosive water wells, toxic tap water, and aquatic dead zones in its wetlands.<br />
Today more challenges are knocking on Dimock&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>News reports suggest Dimock may serve as the location for Eastern Pennsylvania&rsquo;s first deep injection fracking well. Although a formal injection well application has yet to be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, residents located within 1,000 feet of the planned well received letters notifying them of project plans.</p>

<p>An EPA spokesperson <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/11/25/dimock-residents-worry-about-planned-fracking-waste-well/"">told StateImpact PA</a> that representatives of Kendra II, a fracking logistics firm based just south of Dimock, met with agency officials this fall to discuss plans for the injection well.</p>

<p>Residents are rightfully concerned about the threat to their properties, health, and safety.</p>

<p>Although not directly connected to the potential Kendra II injection well, a history of irresponsible drilling practices has literally poisoned the drinking water wells in Dimock. Attorney General Josh Shapiro recently announced charges against major fracking operator Cabot Oil &amp; Gas for alleged criminal violations of the Clean Streams Law.</p>

<p>Almost 15 years have passed since Cabot started to develop dozens of private gas wells within a nine-square-mile area around Dimock. Since then, poisonous chemicals have been discovered in 27 private wells, and explosive levels of methane have been detected in 17.</p>

<p>A Department of Environmental Protection investigation resulted in a restriction on Cabot gas operations around the town, known as the Dimock box, as well as a plan to restore water supplies. Unfortunately, it took Cabot nearly a decade to begin gas well remediation. Many violations remain unresolved today.</p>

<p>The Kendra II injection well would introduce a new set of challenges.</p>

<p>About a dozen deep injection wells are currently permitted in Pennsylvania, but Ohio currently bares most of the brunt. Rising transportation and disposal costs are, however, leading the industry to push for more wells to be located in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Deep injection wells can extend more than a mile underground. The injection process sends a combination of salty brine, hazardous chemicals, radioactive waste, and heavy metals into belowground formations.</p>

<p>This process has proved to be just about as reckless as it sounds. Hazardous wastewater disposed of in injection wells has been known to migrate and contaminate the drinking water of nearby residents. And the impacts do not stop there. Earthquakes associated with injection wells are popping up in Ohio, Oklahoma, and the Dakotas, at times shaking residents hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p>Dimock already knows well the risks posed by the fracking industry. Even the most well-intentioned fracking companies operate with risks that, any day, chemical waste could unintentionally spill or leak. These risks to local drinking water, combined with the possibility that fracking operations could result in earthquakes throughout the Susquehanna Valley, offer plenty of reasons to oppose the Kendra II wastewater injection well.</p>

<p>Dimock has already suffered enough.</p>

<p>PennFuture will be watching this situation closely as it unfolds, and we will be sure to keep the public informed in the months ahead.</p>

PennFuture Releases Blueprint to Protect Pennsylvania's Lake Erie Watershed,12/3/2020,"<p>Today, PennFuture&rsquo;s Erie officepublicly released <a href=""/Files/Admin/ErieCommonAgenda_6.pdf"">Our Water, Our Future: A Common Agenda for Protecting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Lake Erie Watershed.</a></p>

<p>This comprehensive document describes the major threats to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Lake Erie watershed and recommends several solutions to those threats. The Erie region relies heavily on its water resources to attract people to live, work, and play in Erie County. However, the use of those resources and development decisions that are made can lead to their eventual degradation. This Agenda recommends many ways that Erie&rsquo;s decision makers can develop in an equitable, sustainable way, while continuing to benefit from its abundant water resources.</p>

<p>This Agenda was developed by convening local and regional environmental, wildlife, and civic organizations. Twelve partner organizations signed on to the Agenda but at least ten more were engaged in the process of developing it. We met several times via Zoom throughout Summer 2020 to identify threats, prioritize them based on their impacts to human health, the natural environment, and the economy, and brainstorm solutions. A technical advisory committee of non-governmental organizations and several regional scientists was engaged to ensure that the document was technically sound and well-informed. We also sought to ensure that the document made a strong call for racial equity and inclusion, made even more important by Erie County&rsquo;s declaration that <a href=""http://public.eriecountypa.gov/councildocs/resolutions/2020-43.pdf"">racism is a public health crisis.</a></p>

<p>Three organizations acted as social justice consultants by reviewing the Agenda and making recommendations for strengthening the message of equity and inclusion in decision making. The result of these collaborative efforts is a forward-thinking agenda calling for local, county, state, and federal policies that protect our vitally important water resources and promote sustainable development that will improve quality of life for all current and future Erie County residents.</p>

<p>The water quality threats that Common Agenda partners identified are surface runoff including stormwater, agricultural runoff, and sewage, climate change, fossil fuels and plastic pollution, invasive species, and legacy pollution. While the solutions to these threats vary, they all require that municipalities and Erie County embrace the responsibility of being communities on the Great Lakes. This will not only lead to better protected water and healthy communities, it can also stoke the flames of a blue economy in the region.</p>

<p>Among the recommendations are calls to improve collaboration and communication throughout decision-making processes. The social unrest that Erie and the nation have experienced calls everyone to develop new ways of doing things that will not perpetuate persistent inequities and injustice. This agenda invites regional residents, businesses, and government leaders to use the issue of water protection to develop county and municipal level committees that increase resident engagement in decision making. For example, it recommends that Erie County Council establish an Environmental Justice Committee that monitors and responds to disproportionate impacts of pollution on historically burdened residents.</p>

<p>The Erie region is rich in water resources and its current revitalization efforts have relied heavily upon that premise. However, this revitalization will be short lived if it fails to protect these assets and water quality declines. The region needs sustainable transformational change that can only be achieved through inclusive collaboration, equitable decision making, and policies and practices that protect natural resources. This agenda provides a blueprint for all three of these necessities.</p>

<p>PennFuture and its partners will move this agenda forward by meeting with regional stakeholders and government officials to discuss water protection policies and practices and advocate for more inclusive decision-making processes. These collaborative efforts will bring new and important voices to the table and add value to the region&rsquo;s revitalization efforts.</p>

Building the United States' Green Economy Future through Appalachia,12/2/2020,"<p>When I returned to environmental work in Pennsylvania in 2015, after five years working in Maryland for the Audubon Society, I was struck by how much the fracked gas industry&rsquo;s influence was able to dominate policy and policymakers here in the Commonwealth. The firm grip the coal industry had on the legislature for nearly a hundred years had been supplanted by frackers.</p>

<p>Lobbying became a growth industry. New government relations and PR firms occupy Harrisburg offices and real estate, all to help out with the influence peddling and promotion of friendly legislation the industry would need to optimize gas in the Marcellus and Utica shales, and turn it into profits. Regulation was at best weak&mdash;Act 13 left a lot of loopholes and wiggle room for industry to pollute. And the state budget allocations that our regulatory agencies need as their lifeblood to provide oversight of this polluting and secretive industry were squeezed to a drip&mdash;a circumstance our legislature continues today.</p>

<p>With few exceptions, this industry and its political machine has maintained a stranglehold on many elected officials. The industry&rsquo;s playbook disburses campaign contributions throughout the state regardless if a legislative district contains gas, because in Harrisburg, sometimes, every vote counts.Just as dangerous, the frackers&rsquo; public relations firms spin out jobs numbers and promises that any legislator or work-hungry labor union ignored at their peril. The industry created a near unsurmountable ring of self-interest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a fact of life for us that PennFuture&rsquo;s energies are spent defending the environmental protections we fought hard to win in the past. We fight legislative attacks on industry regulations session after session, year after year, and sometimes multiple, identical attacks in any given time period. It became evident to me back thenthat we&rsquo;d be fighting in the legislature for a few more years at best. The majority of our state legislators embrace the status quo.</p>

<p>The people&rsquo;s house in Harrisburg cannot be relied upon for leadership to transition away from fracked gas, a transition that must happen if we are to reckon with our climate, race, economic and public health crisesthat are all crashing into each other at the moment.</p>

<p>When I became president of PennFuture, I felt strongly that one of the most important proactive things that needed to happen if this state is to ever break away from the grips of fossil fuels, fracking, petrochemical and plastics was the creation of an alternative economic development and job creation strategy for our state. It was incorporated into our strategic plan, but the question remained about the suitability of an environmental policy and advocacy shop like PennFuture to tackle this. We kept talking it up, particularly to our funders, and to potential partners who also occupied the policy space but with more substantial chops in economics.</p>

<p>The looming build-out of the so-called Appalachian Storage Hub in the Upper Ohio River Valleybecame a catalyst for concerned groups from Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky to talk about defending our region from it. Eventually that talk turned to offense and the urgent need to develop an alternative economic and jobs strategy. That economic and jobs blueprint is now encompassed by the campaign called <a href=""https://reimagineappalachia.org/"">Reimagine Appalachia</a>, in which PennFuture participates.</p>

<p>Reimagine Appalachia has produced the vision and economic substantiation to turn the region into a nexus for investments that create a regional economy that is sustainable and adapted to the realities of climate change.Characterized by modernizing infrastructure, greening manufacturing, restoring and managing lands decimated by legacy pollution into wide swaths of carbon storing acreage, and by jobs programs that can employ a diversity of people currently finding working difficult due to a variety of factors, this platform will produce 250,000 jobs in Pennsylvania alone. </p>

<p>This past spring, PennFuture staff, who were veterans of the 2008 recession and well-acquainted with the stimulus investments that were made to get a faltering country back on its feet, issued our <a href=""/Files/Admin/Green-Stimulus-FINAL.pdf"">Green Stimulus and Economic Recovery Platform for Pennsylvania</a>. We were able to leverage our knowledge about the inherent strengths of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy that were not linked to fossil fuels and put forth investment ideas for those sectors. Bolstering the strength of what we refer to as nature-based economic sectors, such as outdoor recreation and agriculture, and the network of small businesses that support these sectors, PennFuture argues for targeted investments to bridge the impacts of the pandemic and diversify the state economy.</p>

<p>Like Reimagine Appalachia&rsquo;s platform, we see real opportunities in a green jobs program. We see jobs to restore land and water impacted by not only past pollution, but jobs installing projects that the state is relying on to meet water pollution reduction requirements, and that are in need of funding that stimulus funds can provide. Our Green Stimulus proposals call for investments in bold clean energy projects as well as energy efficiency retrofits for residences and businesses.</p>

<p>In total, through $2.83 billion in annual investments for the duration of the pandemic and the recession it&rsquo;s caused, we estimate the state will preserve or create over 389,000 jobs. Additional economic benefits would come from embracing recommendations on growing and transitioning to a clean energy economy, similar to the aspirations of Reimagine Appalachia.</p>

<p>Another exciting breakthrough came just last week when mayors of eight leading cities in the Ohio River Valley&mdash;the identical geography of Reimagine Appalachia&mdash;including Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, issued a <a href=""https://www.sustainablebusiness.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/mp4ma_roadmap_-_final_1.pdf"">Marshall Plan for Middle America.</a> The plan deftly proposes to position the region for national and international competitiveness, and at the same time addresses regional economic and other disparities, by transitioning into a center for renewable energy infrastructure, and manufacturing and infrastructure innovations, among other proposals.</p>

<p>And so this politically influential region has emerged from the weight of 2020 and has articulated through these three documents a similarity of vision, intention, and determination of where this region wants to go, and must go. And while these are intended as roadmaps for a region, and one that too often has been left behind, therein are opportunities and ideas for the nation. But our climate justice and clean energy future must begin here in Appalachia, whose people, land and water have paid a dear price for powering the nation and world for almost two hundred years.</p>

<p>Finally, the alternative vision that can make a difference.</p>

"PA General Assembly Wraps Up Annual Budget, Punts on Stimulus",11/25/2020,"<p>Last week, the Pennsylvania General Assembly hammered out the final pieces of this year&rsquo;s state budget, which began in late May when the Legislature passed a five-month stopgap budget package. On a bipartisan basis, the Legislature passed the budget bill (SB 1350) and the fiscal code bill (HB 2536) and the Governor signed the legislation into law Monday. For a number of reasons, the package was very problematic and PennFuture urged opposition to both bills during their consideration by the General Assembly.</p>

<p>Not only did the Legislature not act on completing the budget without cutting environmental and conservation funds, it sorely missed the mark on making key investments in recovery and protecting Pennsylvanians during the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p><u><strong>Senate Bill 1350 (Browne) - 2020-21FY Supplemental State Budget:</strong></u><br />
House vote: 104Y-97N<br />
Senate vote: 31Y-18N</p>

<p>While most of the environmental protection and conservation budget lines were approved with flat-funded appropriations from the 2019-20FY levels, a number of accounts do take significant hits. We understand that this year&rsquo;s budget is difficult given the roughly $5B structural deficit coupled with the hole caused by the pandemic-induced recession, but flat-funding our agencies is still felt as a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; due to being less than the &ldquo;cost to carry.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
	<li>For instance, this year&rsquo;s budget approves a 100% ($1,000) cut to the &ldquo;Great Lakes Restoration&rdquo; effort as a part of the PA Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources budget.</li>
	<li>Additionally, 38.5% of the account for &ldquo;Forest Management &amp; Processing&rdquo; ($2.5M) and most concerningly, almost 2% of the line for &ldquo;State Parks Operations&rdquo; ($985,000) was cut.</li>
</ul>

<p>Though the need is overwhelming and advocates have been pushing for increased funding for many years, the water and river basin commissions again take big cuts. With this final budget package (FY2020-21) they are funded at:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$127,000 for the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC)</li>
	<li>$119,000 for the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC)</li>
	<li>$13,000 for the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB)</li>
	<li>$40,000 for the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO) &amp;</li>
	<li>$175,000 for the Chesapeake Bay Commission.</li>
</ul>

<p>Long a legislative interest and sought after place to raid funding to plug other budget holes, the special, dedicated environmental and conservation funds were once again targeted. Though the Recycling Fund was gutted to the tune of $50M (nearly 50% of its total appropriation) and the Agricultural Conservation Easement Purchase Fund was hit, <strong>PennFuture, along with partners in the environmental and conservation community, saved the Environmental Stewardship Fund (Growing Greener) and Keystone Recreations, Parks, and Conservation Fund.</strong></p>

<p><u><strong>A Closer Look at the Agencies&rsquo; Funding Levels via SB 1350:</strong></u></p>

<p><strong>Department of Environmental Protection</strong><br />
General Government Operations: $8,729,000<br />
Environmental Program Mgmt.: $18, 452,000<br />
Chesapeake Bay Agricultural Source Abatement: $1,696,000<br />
Environmental Protection Operations: $54,215,000</p>

<p><strong>Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources</strong><br />
General Government Operations: $15,657,000<br />
State Parks Operations: $27,050,000<br />
State Forests Operations: $25,708,000<br />
State Heritage &amp; Other Parks: $2,487,000<br />
Park &amp; Forest Infrastructure Projects: $525,000</p>

<p><strong>What about code bills?</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the appropriations bill and special fund shenanigans, the General Assembly often passes associated &ldquo;code bills&rdquo; that implement the budget across different areas. These code bills are often used to move nefarious pieces of legislation that, by themselves, wouldn&rsquo;t make it through the legislature. This fall, the legislature has only passed a fiscal code bill to accompany the budget bill. HB 2536 does hold a few problems and bad policy riders. Because of these, PennFuture urged opposition to the fiscal code.</p>

<p><u><strong>House Bill 2536 (James) - Fiscal Code:</strong></u><br />
House vote: 108Y-92N<br />
Senate vote: 33Y-16N</p>

<p><strong>Closing the Borders of Tier II in Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS)</strong></p>

<p>HB 2536 included language similar to the proposed SB1305 (Argall) that would close the &lsquo;borders&rsquo; for Tier II of the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS). This language is identical to legislation from 2017 that would close the &lsquo;borders&rsquo; for solar energy in the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards to help level the playing field for renewable energy and incentivize growth of the renewable energy industry in Pennsylvania, increasing the solar providers in the state. This provision slipped into the fiscal code bill is a giveaway to polluting waste-coal, which could lead to more burning of the coal refuse, dirtying Pennsylvania&rsquo;s air. It is yet another fossil fuel subsidy that the legislature has a storied history of doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Repeal of Act 54 Report</strong></p>

<p>HB 2536 also includes language that hamstrings the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s ability to spend monies and collect fees and penalties as put forth by reporting requirements in Act 54 of 1966, known as the Bituminous Mine Subsidence and Land Conservation Act. This will allow more companies in the mining industry to go without meeting accountability measures set by environmental legislation in the Commonwealth in the 1960s. We must keep these measures in place so that we do not add harm to the historical degradation and legacy pollution from the coal industry in Pennsylvania. No more orange water, acid mine drainage, dewatered streams, and abandoned mine lands. The industry must pay to clean up their own messes and the PA DEP must be well situated to act as the chief regulator and protector of our natural resources.</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps</strong><br />
For many of the issues impacting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment, the costs will only continue to increase the longer they go unabated. State budgets are the ultimate reflection of policy making priorities. Our state priorities are far out of order and need to be changed before the problems become intractable and the harm to our citizens grows more severe.</p>

<p>This fall, the state legislature and elected representatives in Washington balked at passing much-needed, further COVID relief to state and local governments. Where stimulus and recovery monies and large-scale efforts would have proved helpful, we now wait to see what the next administration, 117th Congress and new Pennsylvania General Assembly can accomplish in terms of stimulus and recovery.</p>

<p>PennFuture stands ready to urge lawmakers to make significant investments in green stimulus and recovery including making whole our environmental protection and conservation agencies, new money for supporting nature-based jobs, sustainable agriculture and small food producers, revamping our water infrastructure, significant build-outs in energy efficiency and renewable energy, and more. We will also endeavor to make sure Pennsylvania&rsquo;s stimulus and recovery initiatives are equitable and well serve all Pennsylvanians no matter their station.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve reached the end of this 2019-2020 legislative session in Harrisburg, but we are excited for the next chapter to begin soon. We&rsquo;ll continue to push forward good environmental and clean energy legislation and fight back against anti-environmental bills that are sure to come our way. We&rsquo;ll also keep fighting for a restored budget for our critical agencies. Be on the lookout for a legislative session wrap-up blog coming soon to break down what bills didn&rsquo;t make it across the finish line, which bad bills we&rsquo;ve vanquished, and what bills (good and bad) we&rsquo;re likely to see again in the new session.</p>

Confronting Reality: Pennsylvania Leaders Refuse to Acknowledge State of Petrochemical Industry,11/23/2020,"<p>In the United States&mdash;<o:p></o:p>the biggest fossil fuel producer in the world&mdash;Pennsylvania is second in shale gas production only to Texas. But even Texas is willing to admit something that many Pennsylvania leaders continue to deny: The shale gas and petrochemical industry is dying.</p>

<p>The latest evidence of this came earlier this week when <a href=""https://www.timesleaderonline.com/news/local-news/2020/11/ptt-delays-cracker-investment-decision-again/?fbclid=IwAR0KFIRLK-Oumi8CmONlI7Get-QEUgeCPox-RWpCcJmMZJo7DYiJAOfe4YA"">PTT Global Chemical announced it was indefinitely delaying</a> a final investment decision on a new petrochemical project in southeast Ohio, dealing yet another blow to the <a href=""https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/lies-damned-lies-and-economic-impact-studies/"">so-called Appalachian petrochemical renaissance</a> envisioned by industry leaders and politicians alike. Even the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County will face significant hurdles once it begins operation, directly undercutting the economic impact it was originally predicted to have on the local economy.</p>

<p>All this bodes poorly for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fracked gas industry. Record production has led to an overwhelming oversupply of fracked gas and depressed prices <a href=""https://www.mcall.com/news/pennsylvania/mc-nws-pa-fracking-gas-production-20200916-f36hsugi35a3rgdbijuhdii6ve-story.html"">below the break-even point for much of the past two years.</a> Petrochemical plants, which convert fracked gas to plastics, were meant to gobble up this excess gas and restore prices and profits.</p>

<p>But as plans to deliver on the promised petrochemical buildout come into question, so too has the future of fracked gas in Pennsylvania. Policymakers have tried to patch these unfavorable economics with subsidies and fracked gas-favoring policies, but the billions of taxpayer dollars they&rsquo;ve thrown at the industry has done little to close the gap.</p>

<p>These local examples are mirrored across the world. In a May 2020 article, McKinsey&rsquo;s Houston-based team delivered a sobering analysis to oil and gas proponents, describing the current bust as &ldquo;an unprecedented crisis for the [oil and gas] industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The immediate effects are already staggering[...],&rdquo; the authors write. &ldquo;Looking out beyond today&rsquo;s crisis toward the late 2030s, the macro-environment is set to become even more challenging.&rdquo;<br />
In fact, as Pennsylvania continues to ignore the signs of industry collapse, others in Houston are joining McKinsey in a more honest dissection of the harsh economic realities of the failing oil and gas industry. So, in the words of reporters at the Houston Chronicle, in the heartland of oil and gas, I share with you the following:</p>

<p>From a November 18 article by Paul Takahashi titled <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Oil-bankruptcies-rise-in-the-third-quarter-15736171.php?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Chron_FuelFix&amp;utm_term=business&amp;utm_content=briefing&amp;stn=nf&amp;sid=5f11e83b7afa2729ae52e362"">&ldquo;Oil bankruptcies rise in the third quarter:&rdquo;</a></p>

	<li>A new wave of bankruptcies is sweeping the oil and gas industry after the coronavirus pandemic crushed global demand for crude and petroleum products such as gasoline and jet fuel.

	<li>Oil companies also are reorganizing their businesses and laying off thousands of employees to prepare for a future with fewer fossil fuels. BP plans to lay off 10,000 workers and Chevron plans to lay off 6,000 workers by the end of the year.

<ul>
	<li>For years, a small clique of investors has questioned the logic of putting money into oil and gas pipelines that take decades to pay off when climate change policy was pushing the energy sector away from fossil fuels. Banks and other institutions, however, largely continued to finance the multibillion-dollar projects, confident in projections by oil and gas companies that the so-called energy transition would take time and oil and natural gas would be needed for decades to come. But a rash of cancellations and delays of new pipelines, largely brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, raises questions of whether those skeptics&rsquo; warnings are starting to catch on and the cancellations reflect a newfound wariness among banks to back the projects in view of an uncertain future for fossil fuels.</li>

<p>From a July 30 article by Paul Takahashi titled <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Oil-and-gas-employment-forecast-to-bottom-out-15446433.php"">&ldquo;Oil and gas production jobs in Texas could hit bottom this fall:&rdquo;</a></p>

<ul>
	<li>The oil and gas industry was contracting well before the coronavirus pandemic broke out in the U.S. and brought the economy to a screeching halt. Employment in oil and gas production, including oil-field services jobs, was recovering from the previous downturn of 2014-16, climbing back to 228,500 jobs in December 2018, the alliance said. But then, Wall Street investment soured on the sector after years of underperformance, and the number of operating rigs and employment fell throughout 2019.</li>
</ul>

<p>As these excerpts show, Texas is confronting a reality that Pennsylvania leaders&mdash;from journalists, to state and local representatives, to the industry itself&mdash;continue to deny. COVID-19 has accelerated a shift that was long underway: the phasing out of the oil and gas industry, as well as associated infrastructure including pipelines, refineries, and petrochemical complexes.</p>

<p>This is not short-term conjecture but a long-term reality based on industry underperformance, insurmountable debt, commodity oversupply, and a souring attitude to fossil fuels from investors and global regulators. Anyone who fails to disclose this reality is not telling you the full truth.</p>

<p>Despite all this, the favoritism we continue to show for shale gas in Pennsylvania is astounding: Billions of dollars in tax credits, exemptions from critical public health and environmental protections, and a deafening silence on the industry&rsquo;s economic failures, let alone it&rsquo;s failures to public health, the environment, and our climate.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, independent climate journalist Emily Atkin <a href=""https://heated.world/p/climate-news-trump-can-use-corrected"">reported on the failure of national election coverage</a> to include the cost of doing nothing on climate change. When it comes to climate change and to the failing economics of the fossil fuel industry, these silences are not politically neutral, but instead uphold a status quo that is already leading to catastrophic climate impacts.</p>

<p>To report, to regulate, to understand these issues, we must first be able to admit the truth. Only then will we be able to recognize how we are propping up a dangerous and failing industry.</p>

PennFuture Intervenes to Support FERC Jurisdiction over Wyalusing LNG Facility,11/3/2020,"<p>PennFuture recently joined with the Sierra Club in moving to intervene in and protesting the petition to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&ldquo;FERC&rdquo;) by the owner/operator of the Wyalusing LNG facility, seeking an order by FERC that the agency does not have jurisdiction to review and regulate the facilitysconstruction and operation under the federal Natural Gas Act (&ldquo;NGA&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Over the past year, PennFuture has been engaged with local community members and organizations in tracking and opposing this liquified natural gas (&ldquo;LNG&rdquo;) facility on the Susquehanna River and the transport of LNG by rail or truck across our communities to the export facility in Gibbstown, NJ on the banks of the Delaware River.</p>

<p>To be sure, the Wyalusing facility&rsquo;s operations are speculative and untested, and the ramifications of the operations of the project (including the proposed transport in &ldquo;bomb trains&rdquo;) could be devastating to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and the health and safety of our communities, including environmental justice communities. The safety of this proposed LNG project is unknown; the environmental impacts of this LNG project are unknown; whether this LNG project is required by public convenience and necessity is unknown.</p>

<p>To learn more about LNG, its dangers, and the Wyalusing facility, please check out our LNG Blog Series: <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">LNG Blog #1</a>, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-2-Bomb-Trains-Through-Pennsylvania"">LNG Blog #2</a>, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-3-Protect-Northern-PA"">LNG Blog #3</a>, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-4-Liquified-Natural-Gas-Should-Not-Become-the-New-Bomb-Trains-to-Threaten-Our-Communities"">LNG Blog #4</a>, and <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-5-Public-opposition-grows-to-proposed-LNG-shipping-terminals"">LNG Blog #5</a>.</p>

<p>In our protest to FERC, PennFuture argued that FERC has jurisdiction under both Section 3 and Article 7 of the NGA. First, the Wyalusing LNG facility is a &ldquo;LNG terminal&rdquo; subject to FERC&rsquo;s jurisdiction under Section 3 of the NGA. Second, the facility is transporting gas in interstate commerce as well as exporting gas in foreign commerce and so is subject to FERC&rsquo;s jurisdiction under Section 7 of the NGA. FERC decision precedent does not argue otherwise, and if FERC were not to exercise jurisdiction it would create an unintended regulatory loophole under the NGA. Moreover, the proposed project is contrary to the public interest. Allowing the Wyalusing LNG facility to evade comprehensive FERC review risks the health of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s communities and environment.</p>

<p>Our full joint protest and motion to intervene <a href=""/Files/Admin/SC-and-PennFuture-Protest-and-Intervention-Mot.pdf"">can be read here</a>.</p>

<p>Intervening in this petition is just the first step in ensuring full federal review, oversight, and enforcement of the Wyalusing LNG facility and connected transport and export processes.</p>

An Election Day Wish,11/2/2020,"<p>For the past two years now, a good many of the blogs I’ve created land on the importance of voting – do we really need another one? There are a great many crucial and upcoming matters on the near-horizon for PennFuture that we can talk about here. Among them, Pennsylvania will begin hearings soon on joining and shaping the very important climate-pollution-reducing program called <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2019/09/25/Rob-Altenburg-Pennsylvania-should-join-the-Regional-Greenhouse-Gas-Initiative-but-for-the-right-reasons/stories/201909250048"">the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a> (RGGI). We also have <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/10/18/Deadline-looms-to-defuse-Pennsylvania-s-budget-time-bomb/stories/202010160144"">tough state budget conversations</a> coming right around the corner in mid-November. </p>

<p>But nothing has captured the focus of most Pennsylvanians like this election season. Election Day, November 3, 2020, is nearly here.</p>

<p>Since the lead-up to the primary, this election cycle has been characterized by adapting to new pandemic-induced realities and risks around how we cast our votes. Voters and would-be voters have received straightforward and basic information about new voting and registration formats, but from a bewildering array of sources. Many sources say the same thing but in differing ways. Multiple players and sources can be problematic and feed into another more ugly characteristic of this election, and that is the amount of  unreliable sources, intentional disinformation, subtle undermining, and outright lying to try to discredit voting, this imperfect but still best action we have to participate in our democracy.</p>

<p>We have all walked a very long path to this election. There is excitement, fatigue, anticipation, dread, and a sense of just wanting this election to be over as soon as possible. I must, for the time being, live in a frame of hope and trust that the American people will come through for democracy, for our environment and on the sides of justice, equity and prosperity for all. We must all embrace the likelihood that in order for every vote to be counted, it will take some time, and that means patience on all our parts.</p>

<p>While we wait, let’s reflect on the incredible volunteers, organizations and workers driving this election, on all sides. They are doing everything they can to facilitate access to voting participation. </p>

<p>PennFuture’s Democracy for All team has remained energetic, creative and focused, with their gaze toward communities of color. These communities, who in addition to the strength they are bringing to the Black Lives Matter movement, and in addition to the loss they endure – along with brown communities- as heavily impacted by this pandemic, must now navigate new voting “rules” that rightly create suspicion and distrust.</p>

<p>In the end, if the people come to believe that voting doesn’t matter, our democracy will dissolve, and with it, a key paradigm around which a statewide environmental advocacy organization like PennFuture has been built.  </p>

<p>The outcomes of this election hold high stakes for our environment, and for addressing and ending the injustice and inequity that plague so many of our fellow Pennsylvanians.</p>

<p>So given the possibility for disruption after the election, PennFuture will be weighing its options for engagement, should advocacy be needed. We may find our organization heading back to the courts, or engaging with various elected officials if they become involved in post-election interference, and supporting those that need our assistance. </p>

<p>We will keep you informed through <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/democracyedition"">The Bark</a>, <a href=""https://www.democracyforall-pennfuture.com/"">Democracy for All</a>, and the offerings of our partner <a href=""https://www.conservationpa.org/"">Conservation Voters of PA</a>. And we will be asking for your help in the advocacy we may need to pursue. Until then, stay positive, stay healthy and if you haven’t already, vote!</p>

Green and Complete Streets Programs are Good for Communities and the Environment,10/29/2020,"<p>Last week, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and Philadelphia Streets Department announced they will be funding and installing improvements along Cobbs Creek Parkway, and also initiating a process for a more comprehensive design. This welcomed announcement comes after months of pressure from community residents and <a href=""https://medium.com/@councilmemberjg/west-philadelphia-elected-officials-provide-update-on-cobbs-creek-parkway-pedestrian-safety-efforts-5d70151e7876"">elected leaders Jamie Gauthier, Anthony Hardy Williams, and Joanna McClinton.</a> As part of this new initiative, PennFuture is recommending investments in green and complete streets to address decades of neglect including the environmental injustices of the urban heat island effect, unequal access to green space, and stormwater pollution.</p>

<p>Cobbs Creek Parkway is located on the border of West and Southwest Philadelphia and is a main traffic corridor for the city. In August, the intersection of Cobbs Creek and Catherine Street was the site of the tragic and preventable death of 25-year-old Avante Reynolds, who left behind a 2-month old son. Her death has renewed calls for action to address the safety of the busy highway. Investing in a green and complete streets design of Cobbs Creek Parkway can increase safety, improve the environment, and address inequity in Philadelphia’s neighborhoods. </p>

<p>This hit and run along Cobbs Creek Parkway is not an isolated incident, as there have been 155 crashes there between 2012 and 2016. Residents have lobbied the city and state for decades to invest in safety improvements, but in the end only got small changes. One of the reasons, residents acknowledge, for the lack of investment <a href=""https://whyy.org/episodes/how-racism-fueled/"">is structural racism</a>. The 12-mile long Parkway sits between the Cobbs Creek Park - a park where communities play and recreate, and on the edge of one of Philadelphia’s largest Black neighborhoods that was subject to 20th century redlining. Last month <a href=""/Blog-Item-How-a-clean-water-program-is-addressing-equity-in-Philadelphia"">I blogged about how redlining in Philadelphia</a> caused environmental injustices, particularly for Black communities, and how PennFuture is working to address some of the harms. </p>

<p>One way we’re working to address some of those harms is through our <a href=""/keep-philly-green"">Keep Philly Green & Water Clean Campaign in Philadelphia</a>, which is aimed at supporting the Green City, Clean Waters program - Philadelphia’s Combined Sewer Overflow Long Term Control Plan Update. The program relies primarily on green stormwater infrastructure to reduce combined sewer overflows. The 25 year plan aims to construct 10,000 greened acres using green stormwater infrastructure tools like rain gardens, tree trenches, and curbed bumpouts. Green stormwater infrastructure refers to a nature-based solution to water quality issues that urban stormwater runoff causes and provides greater benefits than conventional stormwater solutions. The plan aims to reduce stormwater pollution from the combined sewer system by 85 percent.  </p>

<p>But rain gardens, tree trenches, and curbed bumpouts do more than just intercept and filter stormwater. They also increase access to green space for Philadelphians, particularly in neighborhoods that were redlined and experienced decades of divestment from city and state agencies. The same neighborhoods that, during hot summer days, experience up to a 22 degree temperature difference because of a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island effect. The social, economic, and environmental benefits of green stormwater infrastructure, when combined with other city resources, can increase investments back into historically neglected neighborhoods. </p>

<p>Streets make up about 40 percent of most cities’ impervious surfaces, and streets are more than just pathways for automobiles. In the case of Cobbs Creek Parkway, along with being a major traffic artery through the city, the road is used by cyclists, walkers and joggers, buses and trolley, and neighbors seeking to play and recreate in the park. The Cobbs Creek Community Environmental Education Center located along the parkway features meadows, forest areas, two creeks and a wetland. Cobbs Creek Park is a community resource of basketball courts, picnic tables, and walking trails. It is the home of Cobbs Creek Recreation Center, ballfields, a skating rink, and swimming pool. </p>

<p>But roads have also been used historically to divide communities and prevent particular segments of populations from accessing resources. In Cobbs Creek’s predominantly Black community, the parkway also divides the community from safely accessing this community amenity and green space. The busy street and limited intersections for safe crossing make the road dangerous for neighbors to cross.</p>

<p>In 2009 Mayor Nutter issued an executive order that ensured the City’s streets would be designed, built, and maintained as <a href=""https://www.philadelphiastreets.com/complete-streets/"">“Complete Streets”</a>. What this means is that the City’s streets would accommodate “all users of the transportation system, be they pedestrians, bicyclists, public transit users, or motor vehicle drivers.” The <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/media/20170914173121/Complete-Streets-Design-Handbook-2017.pdf"">Complete Streets Design Handbook</a> includes traffic and pedestrian accommodating elements as well as urban design tools like green stormwater infrastructure. Green infrastructure used in Complete Streets design can act as a traffic calming measure and community beautification tool that also makes the streets greener and safer for pedestrians and reduces stormwater pollution.</p>

<p>One example of this type of Complete Streets design is a green stormwater infrastructure project at <a href=""http://water.phila.gov/blog/berks-sedgley-ribbon-cutting"">Berks Street and Sedgley Avenue</a> in the neighborhood of Strawberry Mansion. The Water Department recently installed a scope of GSI elements, including a rain garden, subsurface trench, tree trenches and planters. But the construction was also able to include a number of safety improvements to reshape the infrastructure, <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/rain-garden-in-strawberry-mansion-holds-water-and-makes-students-safer/"">providing a safer, more beautiful route</a> for students who frequent the intersection on their way to school and the nearby park. New pedestrian crosswalks, additional parking, and upgrades to ADA ramps were all part of the system’s construction. The project also included <a href=""http://water.phila.gov/blog/everything-about-water-strawberry-mansion"">community participation and engagement</a> that allows residents to offer feedback. </p>

<p>The Philadelphia Water Department has already <a href=""http://water.phila.gov/blog/2019-in-review-part-3"">contributed meaningful significant investments</a> into Cobbs Creek Park. Parts of the Cobbs Creek itself are serviced by combined sewer overflow systems, meaning that when it rains or when snow melts, the runoff combines with household wastewater and the sewers discharge untreated wastewater into the creek. This is the problem that the water department is working to correct through the Green City, Clean Waters program. The green stormwater management tools capture the stormwater before it enters into the sewer systems, filtering the water and reducing the capacity entering the system, ultimately reducing the amount of untreated discharge into nearby waters. </p>

<p>This Spring the water department completed an installation of more than 25 stormwater management tools that collect runoff along Cobbs Creek Parkway from North of Market Street all the way down to Baltimore Avenue. The improvements keep about 372,000 gallons of stormwater out of local sewers during a 1-inch rainstorm. Features include close to 60 new trees, one basin, four bumpouts, 11 infiltration trenches, seven rain gardens and three tree trenches. These green improvements not only benefit the local waterways, but also benefit the community by providing traffic calming improvements, increasing green space, and beautifying the neighborhood.</p>

<p>However, other parts of the parkway are not within the combined sewer overflow area, but do experience significant flooding and stormwater related pollution. Unfortunately, those parts of the creek are outside the scope of the Green City, Clean Waters program. Without the focus of this program, Philadelphia must do more to ensure that all of the community receives similar benefits. The multiple community, pedestrian, vehicular, and environmental concerns require a comprehensive plan.</p>

<p>The announcement from PennDOT of its work to improve this area and consider a comprehensive design process is welcome progress to address the inequities. But the community’s voice must be included in the process to ensure that the improvements benefit not only traffic and stormwater issues, but community health and safety measures. Throughout the process PennFuture will work with residents, state and local agencies, and elected officials to elevate the importance of green and complete streets and bring environmental investments to long neglected communities.</p>

Setting the Record Straight About Fracking in Pennsylvania,10/26/2020,"<p>The issue of fracking in Pennsylvania has taken center stage this election season, with dozens of television news segments, newspaper articles and political commercials dedicated to the topic.With so much media saturation given to it, it should come as no surprise that some basic facts about fracking have been misrepresented, misconstrued or, in some cases, completely fabricated.</p>

<p>For starters, while fracking has become politically toxic on the state and national level, <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/new-poll-shows-majority-of-pennsylvanians-oppose-fracking/Content?oid=17800496"">a majority of Pennsylvania voters actually oppose it</a>. This, as we will see, is no surprise given the mixed economic impact and severe consequences for social impacts, public health, environmental quality, and climate stability.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, fracking has been marketed to legislators and their constituents as an opportunity to turn around the fracked gas bust and create widespread economic opportunities. Part of the marketing ploy involves a consistent misrepresentation of the facts. The number of fracking jobs <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/10/09/trump-pounds-fracking-as-a-wedge-issue-in-pa-but-if-its-not-a-top-concern-for-voters-how-much-can-it-help/"">has been wildly inflated</a>, with industry jockeys citing numbers up to 35 times those provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get the records straight: The industry employs <a href=""https://www.vox.com/21529260/fracking-biden-trump-2020-presidential-debate-climate-change"">about 24,000 people</a> and contributes <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2020/10/21/An-American-success-story/stories/202009250047"">about $583 million</a> to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy annually. To put this number into perspective, there are 10 times as many Pennsylvania jobs <a href=""/Publication-A-Green-Stimulus-and-Recovery-Platform-for-Pennsylvania"">in outdoor tourism and recreation</a> with $29.1 billion in economic benefits, <a href=""/Publication-A-Green-Stimulus-and-Recovery-Platform-for-Pennsylvania"">11 times as many in agriculture</a> with $135.7 billion in economic benefits,and <a href=""https://e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-pennsylvania-2020/"">3 times as many in energy efficiency</a>. To make matters worse, shale gas jobs<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/us/for-oil-workers-deadliest-danger-is-driving.html"">are often non-union jobs</a> with modest pay and no health benefits, despite the many occupational hazards that threaten the health and safety of these workers.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, many of the &ldquo;local&rdquo; jobs made available by the fracking industry go either unfilled or are outsourced, with the industry citing <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/articles/appalachian-energy-and-petrochemical-renaissance#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Energy,of%20its%20abundant%20energy%20resources."">&ldquo;a persistent misalignment of skills with needs&rdquo;</a>and local youth <a href=""https://www.rural.palegislature.us/documents/reports/Marcellus-Report-8-Economics.pdf"">expressing disinterest</a> in joining the migrant workforce. Perhaps to overcome this local shortage, but more importantly to cut costs at a time when prospects for the industry appear dim in light of climate change mitigation efforts, big oil companies are <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Shell-to-Cut-Up-to-9-000-Jobs-as-Virus-Forces-15608330.php"">restructuring for a leaner workforce</a>. Just last month, Shell announced that it will lay off 10 percent of its employees over the next two years.</p>

<p>With so few direct employment opportunities for Pennsylvania residents, most of the employment gains from shale gas development are attributed to &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; or &ldquo;salary-induced&rdquo; jobs. And herein we find the widely inflated job numbers, <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/letters/2020/10/13/Fact-checking-the-energy-secretary/stories/202010060118"">cited most recently by Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette</a>, that include everything from downstream plastics manufacturers to convenience and gas station workers, as well as other similarly <a href=""https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/sites/default/files/fracking_jobs_memo_final.pdf"">far-fetched &ldquo;salary-induced&rdquo; jobs</a>, many of which existed before the shale gas boom.</p>

<p>In essence, the industry creates a negligible percentage of Pennsylvania jobs, many of which are outsourced, while taking credit for a broad swath of jobs in other industries.What, then, is its actual impact on local communities?</p>

<p>The impact, it appears, is a mixed bag. The benefits are, on the whole, non-local, uneven, and short-term. Employment opportunities are limited, meaning that most of the increase in local taxable income has been driven by <a href=""https://www.rural.palegislature.us/documents/reports/Marcellus-Report-8-Economics.pdf"">increased rents and royalties</a> from those that lease their land to drillers. This means that most benefits accrue to the privileged few who own land, <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/2/025001"">plenty of whom are non-local themselves</a>. And wherever the income comes from, whether from employment or leased land, and wherever it goes, all of it is temporary. After drilling, <a href=""https://www.rural.palegislature.us/documents/reports/Marcellus-Report-8-Economics.pdf"">98 percent of shale gas development jobs dry up</a>, and rents and royalties dry up soon after.</p>

<p>But what about the so-called salary-induced jobs? Business activity has indeed increased in heavily fracked areas. However, the business activity occurs <a href=""https://www.rural.palegislature.us/documents/reports/Marcellus-Report-8-Economics.pdf"">primarily at big box stores</a> owned by non-locals. Meanwhile, locally owned businesses <a href=""https://www.rural.palegislature.us/documents/reports/Marcellus-Report-8-Economics.pdf"">have declined in heavily fracked counties</a>. In either case, the business activity &ndash; mostly driven by transient gas workers staying in hotels and eating out &ndash; can only last as long as the drilling does, at most a few years.</p>

<p>And these benefits do not come without harm. Empirical analyses have found that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s shale gas development has led to in the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2814147"">An influx of transient</a>, less educated, young, unmarried male workers with few social ties to the areas in which they temporarily settle</li>

	<li><a href=""https://www.lycoming.edu/political-science/pdfs/marcellus-housing-report-2015.pdf"">More expensive rental housing</a>, degraded quality of housing units, and housing shortages, due to the influx of short-term, transient workers, and a related increase in homelessness</li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988316303590"">A decline in educational attainment</a> (PA was not a part of this study, but the association was found in all three study states &ndash; MO, WV, and ND)</li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.rff.org/publications/reports/the-accident-externality-from-trucking/"">An increase in truck traffic</a>, leading to noise pollution, stress, car accidents, and related fatalities</li>

</ul>

<p>Other studies have found that dependence on natural resources such as shale gas leads to <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08941920.2020.1728000?journalCode=usnr20"">deepening educational disparities</a>, <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/ECONW-Costs_of_Fracking-May2019.pdf"">less resilient and diverse economies</a>, <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014292106000614"">increased corruption</a>, and <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0928765510000485"">anemic economic growth</a>. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania residents living nearest to drilling <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FINAL-fracking-report-w.responses-with-page-number-V2.pdf"">have reported frequent nose bleeds</a>; chronic stress; the inability to sleep due to bright lights, noise, and vibrations through the night; intense stomach pains; and feelings of isolation and lack of control as property values drop and prevent homeowners from relocating. To make matters worse, those reaping the benefits of fracking (distant corporate offices, transient workers, and landowners) <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/2/025001"">are not the same as those most impacted</a> by its harms (low-income renters and fenceline residents).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, legislators have largely bought into the industry&rsquo;s economic development narrative, so much so that they were willing to subsidize its use with $2 billion in tax credits over the next 25 years. And while taxpayer dollars are pouring into the industry, <a href=""https://ieefa.org/ieefa-from-zero-to-fifty-global-financial-corporations-get-cracking-on-major-oil-gas-lending-exits/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=ieefa-from-zero-to-fifty-global-financial-corporations-get-cracking-on-major-oil-gas-lending-exits"">financial institutions are pulling out</a> because they recognize the many early signs of the fracking fallout: <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/shales-bust-shows-basis-of-boom-debt-debt-and-debt/2020/07/22/0e6ed98c-cc41-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html"">depressed prices</a>, <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-natural-gas-demand-peak/?srnd=green&amp;sref=piRJ9MA3"">peak gas demand</a>, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/shales-bust-shows-basis-of-boom-debt-debt-and-debt/2020/07/22/0e6ed98c-cc41-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html"">mounting debt</a>, <a href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/2020/10/15/bankruptcies-oil-gas-multi-billion-cleanup-bill-public?utm_source=DeSmog%20Weekly%20Newsletter"">record bankruptcies</a>, and <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Exxon-Mobil-Flags-Potential-Job-Cuts-in-Email-to-15666749.php"">industry-wide layoffs.</a></p>

<p>As aptly summarized <a href=""https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/4691da36-2e74-4c4c-99f0-19c3eee5ac9e/downloads/1d31iaaj6_122302.pdf?ver=1558223417346"">in a report by Pennsylvania nonprofit UrbanKind</a>, &ldquo;The benefits of fracking have not translated into widespread, long-term economic improvement.&rdquo; The very nature of fracking operations has ensured that this will continue to be true, and the long-term outlook of the industry only provides further evidence that our deepening reliance is more a liability than an asset.</p>

<p>Despite an abundance of evidence that the shale gas industry has failed our residents, Pennsylvania legislators lack the imagination to envision an economic future based on anything other than fossil fuels. In doing so, they write our state out of the clean energy future which most certainly lies ahead.</p>

<p>The age of fossil fuel dominance is over, and it is now time to listen to Pennsylvania residents demanding the reigning in of the fracking industry. We must redirect our precious state resources to industries that hold long-term economic promise and, beyond that, do not directly undermine public health, environmental protection, and climate stability.</p>

Clean Water Advocacy Forges Ahead Despite Pandemic,10/15/2020,"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has left its impact on all of us and continues to raise uncertainty at every corner, including in our clean water advocacy. Every year, in the spring, our clean water advocates from across the state travel to Harrisburg to educate elected officials on the importance of clean water.</p>

<p>This spring, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we acted quickly with our partners to adapt the day-long event into a new socially distanced way of doing clean water advocacy. We created the first ever <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-partners-to-celebrate-PA-Clean-Water-Week"">PA Clean Water Week</a> and moved our meeting with legislators from the Capitol to the virtual, which now has become the norm.</p>

<p>We also looked to the first week of October to schedule an in-person Harrisburg event. However, six months later the pandemic still ensues. It turned out to be a good thing that we were already planning the first ever Fall Clean Water Education Day, because the General Assembly has to pass a fall supplemental budget. The &ldquo;annual&rdquo; budget passed by the General Assembly in June was for 5 months, allowing time for the state to react to the unfolding pandemic and its economic implications.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is facing a nearly $5 billion revenue gap from last year and state legislators must pass a budget by the end of November to carry out this year&rsquo;s budget, which ends in June. With such a budget deficit, our clean water funding is in danger of serious cuts.</p>

<p>Last week the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed, the Choose Clean Water Coalition, and partner organizations from western Pennsylvania met with our state legislators to talk about the importance of keeping funding for clean water in the Fall 2020 Supplemental Budget. In addition, we sent a letter with 38 signatories to Governor Wolf last week asking him to protect our clean water funding this fall.</p>

<p>Two years ago, clean water advocates <a href=""/Files/Admin/cleanwaterbriefingbook2019-01.pdf"">agreed on three priorities</a> for clean water funding.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Funding for the state&rsquo;s Natural Resources Agencies, such as DEP and DCNR</li>
	<li>Funding for the Interstate River Basin Commissions, such as DRBC and SRBC</li>
	<li>A Dedicated Source of Funding for Clean Water</li>
</ol>

<p><u>Funding for the state&rsquo;s Natural Resources Agencies</u></p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) are tasked with several important roles related to clean water. Unfortunately, over the past couple decades they have witnessed significant budget cuts that impact their capacity. Since 2002, state funding for the DEP has been cut by nearly 40 percent, leading to a reduction of staff by 30 percent. And, General Fund support for DCNR has been slashed over the last 15 years, declining from $108.8 million in 2002-03 to a low of $14.5 million in 2014-15.</p>

<p>DEP is responsible for permitting activities that protect public health, such as drinking water and wastewater facilities. DEP is also responsible for permitting activities that may cause harm to our waterways, such as stormwater and construction site runoff. DEP also administers state and federal grant programs that put projects that protect our streams, such as the Environmental Stewardship Fund and Section 319 grants. Funding for DEP is essential for public health and clean water.</p>

<p>DCNR oversees hundreds of programs and parks, greenways, open space, and natural areas, all which benefit our rivers and streams. Yet last year, the Pennsylvania Parks and Forests Foundation estimated that DCNR has a $1 billion infrastructure backlog due to a lack of state funding.</p>

<p>Funding for DCNR is critical to the conservation of our waterways. Our public lands provide vast forested landscapes and natural infrastructure that benefit water quality. At its facilities, DCNR operates wastewater treatment systems as well as stormwater infrastructure. DCNR also administers the state&rsquo;s riparian forested buffer program for streamside trees.</p>

<p><u>Funding for the Interstate River Basin Commissions</u></p>

<p>Pennsylvania is part of five Interstate Basin Commissions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Delaware River Basin Commission</li>
	<li>Susquehanna River Basin Commission</li>
	<li>Interstate Commission for the Potomac River Basin</li>
	<li>Ohio River Valley Sanitation Commission</li>
	<li>Great Lakes Commission</li>
</ul>

<p>River Basin Commissions are agencies formed by interstate compact to serve state and federal government agencies that coordinate interstate waterway planning and management. The authority of each River Basin Commission varies but each may be responsible for overseeing water quality, flood control, wildlife, water flow, water withdrawals, aquatic flora, recreation, navigation, and industrial runoff in their respective basin. The health and prosperity of each river basin and its inhabitants relies on strong participation and supportive funding of member states in each River Basin Commission.</p>

<p><u>A Dedicated Source of Funding for Clean Water</u></p>

<p>The three leading sources of pollution into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways are (in descending order): runoff from agricultural lands, acid mine drainage from legacy coal mining, and stormwater runoff from developed surfaces. Because the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting system, established a mechanism for reducing pollution coming from industry and other types of facilities, much of the pollution that impacts our waterways is coming from nonpoint source pollution. To clean up this type of pollution, we need to put practices in place that keep the runoff from reaching our streams.</p>

<p>A dedicated source of funding established for clean water projects would help farmers, local governments, conservation organizations, and others working across the Commonwealth to clean up our waterways and fund the projects necessary to do the job. Furthermore, the planning, design, construction, and long-term maintenance of clean water projects create and sustain employment opportunities.<br />
<br />
<u>The Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program</u></p>

<p>In September 2020, <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1272"">Senator Yaw introduced SB 1272</a>, the Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program, or ACAP for short. This bill would provide funding assistance directly to farmers or landowners to implement conservation practices that protect or improve our waterways. ACAP would be overseen by the State Conservation Commission, however, decisions on funding projects and the application process would be handled at the local level by the County Conservation Districts. The ACAP program would provide funding to farmers statewide and funding to the counties would be proportional to the agricultural footprint of a county. The more farms, the more livestock and cropland, and the more impaired streams from agricultural sources, the more money a county would receive.</p>

<p>The passage of ACAP is critical to improving our rivers and streams because it addresses Pennsylvania&rsquo;s leading source of stream impairment. Currently, ACAP sits in the Senate Agriculture &amp; Rural Affairs Committee and could make it to a vote in the full Senate this fall. SB 1272 proposes to create a program which is local, supported by farmers, and puts funding directly in the hands of farmers.</p>

<p><u>Fertilizer Legislation</u></p>

<p>In addition to advocating for clean water funding in the budget, PennFuture is working to see SB 915 passed this fall. This bill would establish limits on fertilizers applied to grassy areas, such as lawns and turf. Establishing such limits would improve the health of our rivers and streams. The ground can only hold a limited amount of nutrients, or fertilizers. When grass is overfertilized beyond what can be absorbed by the soil, the excess will wash off into waterways or move down into the groundwater. Over 2,600 miles of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s streams are impaired due to excess nutrients. </p>

<p>Excess nutrients fuel plant and algae growth in our streams. When the algae die they can deplete the oxygen available to other life in the waterways, like fish and macroinvertebrates. Excess algae can also cloud the water, reducing the sunlight available to important vegetation that provide food, cover, and habitat for aquatic life.</p>

<p>If passed, SB 915 will:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a level playing field for fertilizer companies across the state and protect local waters, moving towards one standard across the region and providing regional companies with similar market requirements to those in neighboring states.</li>
	<li>Limit how much nitrogen and phosphorus are applied to turf (grass).</li>
	<li>Establish a professional fertilizer applicator certification program, similar to pesticide applicators, that will ensure that professionals apply fertilizers at the proper rates, as established in this bill.</li>
	<li>Develop an Agricultural and Homeowner Education Program to educate nonprofessional applicators on the proper rate of applying fertilizers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Right now, this bill sits in the House Agriculture &amp; Rural Affairs Committee, which is led by a new chair, Representative Keller, from Perry County. It passed the Senate in late spring. With strong support behind the bill from many stakeholders, we hope to see this bill passed this fall.</p>

<p>As you can see, there is no shortage of clean water advocacy needed this fall. Please stay tuned to our website, emails, and social media for updates on what you can do to help protect our waters.</p>

<p>Right now, <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/915alert"">you can follow this link asking your state Representative</a> to pass SB 915 and improve our waterways from excess nutrient pollution.</p>

Toxic Fracking Waste Becomes Mounting Problem for Downstream Communities,10/13/2020,"<p>We know the dangers of fracking operations &ndash; groundwater contamination, air quality issues, devastating health impacts &ndash; but what many might not realize is that the fracking industry is allowed to dispose of its wastes in landfills across Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>As a result, dangerous chemicals in fracking waste &ndash; such as radioactive materials &ndash; eventually make their way into Pennsylvania waters, threatening the health and safety of our communities and our streams.</p>

<p>The Marcellus Shale <a href=""http://vjel.vermontlaw.edu/files/2018/02/Geltman_FP-2.pdf"">is estimated to contain 10 to 100 parts per million (ppm) of uranium</a>, up to 33 times the national average. This unique geology means that rocks brought to the surface during Pennsylvania fracking operations likely have high levels of Radium-226. The industry calls this waste &ldquo;technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material&rdquo; (<a href=""https://www.epa.gov/radiation/technologically-enhanced-naturally-occurring-radioactive-materials-tenorm"">TENORM</a>).</p>

<p>Given the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/radionuclides.pdf"">long-term implications of exposure to radium</a>, one of the radioactive chemicals found in fracking waste, communities are raising concerns. Clearly, greater scrutiny is needed &mdash; both of fracking operations and of the landfills that accept the industry&rsquo;s waste.</p>

<p>Although Pennsylvania landfills are not permitted to accept liquid waste, some 30 landfills in Pennsylvania and several in neighboring states accept drill cuttings from fracking sites. Pennsylvania landfills are required to screen drill cuttings to ensure they do not exceed maximum radioactivity levels. But what happens after the cuttings are admitted into the landfill?</p>

<p>When fracking waste combines with stormwater, the pool of leached water mixed with chemicals (&ldquo;leachate&rdquo;) may become a dangerously radioactive runoff, flowing into downstream treatment facilities or directly into nearby waterways.</p>

<p>Landfills are required to treat leachate or somehow capture and transport it to other treatment facilities, but there are no requirements that landfills trace the leachate from fracking waste. This means that radioactive leachate may be threatening our waters without us knowing.</p>

<p>StateImpact Pennsylvania has found <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2019/09/11/how-did-fracking-contaminants-end-up-in-the-monongahela-river-a-loophole-in-the-law-might-be-to-blame/"">16 wastewater treatment plants take treated leachate from landfills</a>. Another 12 treatment plants are too small to be screened by DEP and instead, if they are at all taking action to treat or prevent the inflow of fracking leachate, do so voluntarily.</p>

<p>Public Herald <a href=""https://publicherald.org/pennsylvania-regulators-wont-say-where-66-of-landfill-leachate-w-radioactive-material-from-fracking-is-going-its-private/"">has also investigated these scenarios</a>, producing a map that <a href=""https://novarecollective.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=522c1a37d9f6430c8f05d6041b294af6"">shows the location of 30 landfills</a> likely to accept fracking waste and some 20 wastewater treatment plants that may be receiving the contaminated leachate.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection declared <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=5815&amp;DocName=01%20PENNSYLVANIA%20DEPARTMENT%20OF%20ENVIRONMENTAL%20PROTECTION%20TENORM%20STUDY%20REPORT%20REV%201.PDF%20"">in a 2016 report that the public faced</a> &ldquo;little potential for radiation exposure&rdquo; from landfills receiving fracking waste. Defenders of the report later said any treatment plants that accept contaminated leachate <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2015/12/28/report-revives-debate-over-risks-of-radiation-from-drilling-waste/"">remove the radium</a>.</p>

<p>But the Westmoreland Sanitary Landfill, where the fracking industry deposited nearly 160,000 tons of drill cuttings, mud, and other fracking waste in 2018, has proven this was a faulty assumption and that the threat is real.</p>

<p>The landfill has been receiving fracking waste since 2010 and up until May 2019, leachate flowed downhill from the landfill, directly into the sewer, where it eventually made its way to the Belle Vernon Municipal Authority&rsquo;s treatment plant.</p>

<p>The authority reported that the leachate <a href=""http://www.paenvironmentdigest.com/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=49058&amp;SubjectID=83"">was killing bacteria intended to treat the wastewater</a>. Tests of the Monongahela River near the plant showed levels of radium at 8 picocuries per liter. The EPA standard for drinking water is 5.</p>

<p>Because of this highly contaminated leachate, the Authority cancelled its contract to treat the leachate from the landfill due to the fact that the leachate from the landfill had become untreatable and threated the water quality of the Monongahela. Since then, the landfill has been forced to truck its contaminated leachate to an out-of-state treatment facility.</p>

<p>The contaminated leachate also resulted in environmental litigation against the landfill and in February 2020, <a href=""https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/DEP_details.aspx?newsid=1313"">DEP issued a consent order with Westmoreland Sanitary Landfill,</a> charging the facility a $24,000 civil penalty and requiring actions to minimize leachate generation.</p>

<p>In May, the landfill <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2020/05/23/Westmoreland-County-landfill-seeks-approval-to-evaporate-contaminated-runoff/stories/202005220120"">announced plans to use an &ldquo;ultra-filtration&rdquo; system</a> to remove solids from the radium-rich leachate by evaporating it into the atmosphere &mdash; up to 45,000 gallons of leachate per day. PennFuture joined others in opposing this proposal citing the significant threat to human health and the environment from the resulting radon gases that are likely to be emitted through the evaporation process.</p>

<p>PennFuture argued that no approval should be issued unless and until DEP has sufficiently monitored, reviewed, considered, analyzed, and mitigated, if necessary, this threat.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re continuing to monitor this matter as well as others to protect Pennsylvanians and our environment from the dangers &ndash; known and unknown &ndash; that the fracking and petrochemical industries pose.</p>

How a Clean Water Program is Addressing Equity in Philadelphia,10/5/2020,"<div>While testifying in front of <a href=""/Files/Admin/Smith-Public-Testimony_200336_COVIDRecovery-1-.pdf"">Philadelphia City Council&rsquo;s Joint Committees on Finance and Commerce and Economic Development</a> about COVID-19 recovery strategies last week, I highlighted a strategy that Philadelphia can take to address the many interlocking crises the city is currently facing.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Whether it&rsquo;s the COVID-19 public health crisis, structural racism, economic downturn, or gun violence, one action can offer real solutions to them all: investing in green space. In particular, I sought to highlight how green space is addressing the structural inequality created by a practice known as redlining that black and brown neighborhoods were subject to during the 20th century.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Redlining was a practice that began in the 1930&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/redlining-what-is-history-mike-bloomberg-comments/"">where many banks in the U.S. denied mortgages to people,</a> mostly people of color in urban areas, preventing them from buying a home in certain neighborhoods or getting a loan to renovate their house. The practice was once backed by the U.S. government and occurred in many of the nation&rsquo;s largest cities with large minority populations.</div>

<div></div>

<div>While the South had segregation and Jim Crow laws, the North had redlining. As part of the practice, financial firms, real estate agents and other parties demarcated geographic areas that were effectively off limits for issuing loans by literally using red ink to outline parts of the city. These areas were considered high risk of default. Riskier neighborhoods <a href=""https://whyy.org/segments/redlining-segregated-philadelphia/"">were predominantly Black and Latino</a>, but also recently immigrated European groups like Jews and Italians.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Redlining has had a devastating long-term impact on U.S. urban areas and Black people particularly. Redlining allowed for the systematic denial of various services by federal government agencies, local governments, as well as the private sector. It has also had <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/past-racist-redlining-practices-increased-climate-burden-on-minority-neighborhoods/"">a lasting environmental impact.</a> Redlined communities were often subject to air quality deterioration from urban highways, industrial plants and landfills. They are also more likely to experience extreme heats than other communities because of a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island effect.</div>

<div></div>

<div>The Urban Heat Island effect occurs in urbanized areas that experience higher temperatures than outlying neighborhoods because of a lack of green space and a high density in asphalt pavement and rooftops. The divestment from redlined neighborhoods also resulted in a lack of investment in green spaces from those same communities. In Philadelphia, these neighborhoods experience <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/philadelphia-heat-island-climate-change-hunting-park-20190724.html"">up to a 22 degree temperature difference</a> during hotter months of the year. These neighborhoods also have a greater amount of impervious surface that produces a larger amount of stormwater pollution.</div>

<div></div>

<div>In 2011 when Philadelphia implemented their Green City, Clean Waters plan, they did so recognizing the opportunities to reverse some of the historical divestment from Philadelphia&rsquo;s Black and Brown neighborhoods. Green City, Clean Waters is the City&rsquo;s Combined Sewer Overflow Compliance program. When Philadelphia first constructed its wastewater and stormwater system over 200 years ago, before enactment of the Clean Water Act, they relied on a combined sewer system model.</div>

<div></div>

<div>While combined sewer systems were the standard wastewater/stormwater management practice during that time, with the increase in impervious surface, growth, and development, the sewer system can no longer withstand the amount of stormwater runoff entering the system. Traditionally, the solution is to invest in the construction of large tunnels, storage tanks, and wastewater treatment plant upgrades. The costs associated with the traditional approach were estimated to cost about $8-10 billion and would rely on large infrastructure companies that typically bring in high skilled labor from outside of the region to construct the infrastructure. </div>

<div></div>

<div>Green City, Clean Waters is a more cost effective alternative that is also bringing investment back to neighborhoods that often need it the most. The program relies on the implementation of green stormwater infrastructure - like rain gardens, tree trenches, and green roofs - to filter stormwater through plants, soil, and stones before it enters the combined sewer system. This water infrastructure investment is also creating green space and addressing the Urban Heat Island Effect.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Green City, Clean Waters <a href=""https://gsipartners.sbnphiladelphia.org/the-economic-social-and-environmental-case-for-green-city-clean-waters-an-update/"">provides approximately 1,000 local jobs annually</a> and creates a $4 million economic impact - creating local jobs and building a robust regional green economy. Research shows that access to green space <a href=""https://phys.org/news/2020-02-reveals-green-space-violent-crime.html"">reduces crime and blight</a>, increases opportunities to play and recreate, and <a href=""https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/translational/peph/webinars/green_spaces/index.cfm"">improves mental and physical health.</a></div>

<div></div>

<div>Green stormwater infrastructure may not be able to solve the entirety of structural racism and its impact on Philadelphians, but investing in this innovative approach to stormwater management is one way the city is seeking to address the harm caused by racist housing policies.</div>

<div></div>

<div>PennFuture is a proud supporter of Green City, Clean Waters and the efforts the City of Philadelphia is taking to reinvest in historically neglected neighborhoods. Through it we are seeking to do our part in addressing racism and creating a healthier environment.</div>

An Admission and a Promise,10/1/2020,"<p>Angst and pain have been common themes for many of us in 2020, given the onset of a deadly pandemic interwoven with social unrest and a democracy that appears to be failing on multiple fronts. </p>

<p>To say that 2020 has been a year of tremendous upheaval and volatility is underselling it. This has been a year none of us will soon forget, and for good reason. </p>

<p>While this has been a difficult year for many of us, the fact remains that millions of people across the United States have been living with deep anxiety and frustration for far longer than just this calendar year. </p>

<p>For Black people, 2020 has been nothing more than the status quo, just another continuation of a long and systemic string of racial and environmental injustices perpetrated on entire segments of our population ad infinitum.</p>

<p>These are entire communities in our country that suffer on a daily basis, and have been subjugated for centuries. The racial unrest and tensions we’re seeing today are a direct result of being ignored, trampled upon and disregarded for entire lifetimes.</p>

<p>The United States is finally reckoning with the fact that black, indigenous, and other communities of color have been treated far different, and far worse, for far too long. </p>

<p>That reckoning is also happening at PennFuture, as we reflect internally on the role that we can play in ending racism. Since our inception in 1998, PennFuture has tried to advocate for every person who breathes air and drinks water in Pennsylvania, and that won’t change. </p>

<p>But, like many others, we’ve fallen short in our efforts to help build a truly equitable and just Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This is both an admission and a promise: an admission that the traditional environmental movement, including PennFuture, has largely remained silent on racial justice issues, and a promise that we will do better moving forward. We must do better moving forward. </p>

<p>The murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in May was the latest reminder that inaction and race-silent policies are no longer acceptable, but it’s not the only reminder. To that end, more than 1,000 people have been killed by police since 2013. Last year alone, <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2020-06-03/data-show-deaths-from-police-violence-disproportionately-affect-people-of-color"">54 percent of those who died</a> as a result of police violence were people of color.</p>

<p>So where do we go from here?</p>

<p>For starters, PennFuture created a new internal committee to explore these and other issues, and to outline the best path forward as we take this journey with a staff and board of directors of about 45 people.</p>

<p>Another step forward was to admit we needed help on this journey, so we are seeking expertise and guidance from outside experts and guides who will help shine a light on implicit biases and blind spots to help us transform PennFuture’s culture, and ensure we understand the operational and other practices that will make us a more welcoming and open organization to a greater diversity of individuals. </p>

<p>Finally, we decided to craft a heartfelt and meaningful statement that is meant to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

<p>This statement has gone through dozens of edits and revisions, and has been vetted by the entirety of PennFuture’s staff and board. We stand behind this statement, and it won’t simply be pasted on PennFuture’s website and forgotten. </p>

<p>Rather, this statement is a jumping-off point to a much larger internal discussion within PennFuture, the start of a long process to permanently transform the organization. That will not be quick or easy. Nor should it be. </p>

<p>If you’re interested in reading our solidarity statement,<a href=""/News-PennFuture-releases-statement-showing-solidarity-with-Black-Lives-Matter-movement""> please click here</a>, or just continue reading. It is copied below for anyone who wishes to read it. </p>

<p>We plan on being forthright and honest as this process unfolds, and we appreciate your patience as we work through these delicate and imminently important issues. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size:16px;""><u><strong>PennFuture Solidarity Statement</strong></u></span></p>

<p>George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Darrell Banks. Tony McDade. Atatiana Jefferson. Nina Adams. Antwon Rose. Tamir Rice. Ricardo Giddings. Brandon Tate Brown: Ten Black lives stolen by police in recent years, among the more than 1,000 people that police have killed since 2013. Last year alone, 54 percent of those who died as a result of police violence were people of color. </p>

<p>These are lives cut short because of systemic racism in American society. The murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police is yet another reminder of this seemingly intractable racism, his dying words – “I can’t breathe” – literal and figurative assertions of generation after generation of suffocating injustices.</p>

<p>In the wake of George Floyd’s death, we have seen black communities protesting state-sanctioned police violence only to be met with tear gas, rubber bullets, and a militarized police force. PennFuture stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in the fight to end violence and all other manifestations of systemic racism. We do this in part because we recognize the connections between racism and the protection of clean air, water, and land. </p>

<p>Black, brown, and indigenous communities are disproportionately burdened by polluting refineries, contaminated water, and toxic dumping. This is environmental racism. Black children are twice as likely to have asthma as white children. This is environmental racism. Movements of black people in public parks and open spaces are policed and controlled. This is environmental racism. And environmental racism is systematically causing the premature death of black people and other people of color. </p>

<p>In the face of overwhelming evidence of environmental racism, the traditional environmental movement, including PennFuture, has largely remained silent on racial justice issues. That is, until recently. At PennFuture, we have begun the long process of actively incorporating anti-racist practices. With expert guidance, our team will begin to shine a light on implicit biases and blind spots to transform PennFuture from the inside out.</p>

<p>We grieve for the lives lost, the communities trampled, and the voices silenced by racism in this country. We are committed to uncovering the root causes of this suffering and repairing the harms after decades of silence. In solidarity with Black Lives Matter, we embrace an inclusive and equitable environmentalism that affirms all Pennsylvanians’ rights to a healthy environment. </p>

<p>In peace and solidarity, </p>

Creative Civic Engagement During the Pandemic,9/30/2020,"<p>The 2020 election is just about one month away. Many voters are highly engaged as the stakes are so high for the values we each hold personally dear for our families, our communities, state and country.</p>

<p>As an advocacy organization active with state and federal policy, in legislatures and the courts, PennFuture views participation in voting as strategic to the environmental outcomes we work toward. So we moved more intentionally into democracy work to ensure that this aspect of our democracy is optimized.</p>

<p>We want everyone who is eligible to vote to be registered to vote, and we work to be sure that those who are registered to vote are able to do so safely, free of intimidation and in as informed a way as possible.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s Democracy for All program focuses on non-partisan voter registration, voter education, voter engagement and get-out-the vote work. It is aimed at individuals of color, millennials and single women, a group of voters sometimes referred to as the New American Majority or Rising American Electorate.</p>

<p>Last summer, when we were planning our non-partisan voter registration program, we envisioned a tried and true model that would be deploying canvassers into the field, armed with iPads or tablets, and electronically registering eligible individuals in person. COVID-19upended that model as our need to provide for the safety of our staff and contractors became a paramount consideration.</p>

<p>We held out hope until the last possible minute to run an in-person program but the persistence of the pandemic and contagion of the virus made it too difficult.</p>

<p>Our team needed to get creative and pivot our tactics. Despite all of these restrictions and limitations, we are still out in Pennsylvania communities registering people to vote in the most important election in recent memory.</p>

<p>Some highlights:</p>

	<li>In July, PennFuture and our partners <a href=""https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/lehighvalley/art-installation-in-allentown-gets-creative-in-promoting-voter-turnout/article_696f552e-c3c1-11ea-a378-37cb219f675f.html"">installed an art piece entitled Inscribete a Votar inAllentown;</a></li>

The program just wrapped up this week of voter action with a daily suite of highly visual and art-oriented engagement tools with our partner Democracy for All programs throughout the country ; and</li>
	<li>The team <a href=""/Files/Admin/IMG_0781.jpg"">recently formed a voter registration caravan</a> that made its way through the Wyoming Valley, the Poconos and Lehigh Valley on a rainy Saturday. Attached to the vehicles were magnetic signs featuring bar codes that a viewer can aim her/his/its smart phone at and be directed to a voter registration website. The caravan <a href=""/Files/Admin/IMG_0779.jpg"">ended in Allentown</a> where it drove by a rally and march for Breonna Taylor.</li>
	<li>The team is also deploying texting and calling to promote voter registration. <a href=""https://www.democracyforall-pennfuture.com/register-2-vote"">October 19, 2020 is the last day to register to vote in the November 3, 2020 elections</a>. After that date the Democracy for All program will pivot to get-out-the-vote efforts.</li>

<p>PennFuture is dedicated to fighting for clean air, clean water and a healthy environment, and our Democracy for All program is equally dedicated to ensuring that disenfranchised communities in Pennsylvania make their voices heard by voting in all elections.</p>

<p>We are reminded of the words of the Honorable John Lewis, &quot;Voting and participating in the democratic process are key. The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it.&quot;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no better way to change the present and forge a better future than by voting. Here&rsquo;s to hoping everyone who is eligible registers to vote, and there&rsquo;s no better time to register than right now.</p>

Fossil Fuel Polluters and Friends Ramp Up New Attack on Solar Energy in Pa.,9/29/2020,"<p>Fossil fuel polluters and their enablers in the legislature have been ramping up a new attack on solar energy in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Rep. Chris Dush, one of the most notorious climate deniers in the state House of Representatives, led this charge in a recent House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee meeting with a speech <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/repdush/videos/354190742292978/"">that was either intentionally dishonest or profoundly ignorant.</a></p>

<p>He began by claiming that coal is &ldquo;just compost&rdquo; and is &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; whereas solar panels make use of &ldquo;man-made chemical compounds&rdquo; that are toxic.</p>

<p>Right from the start we recognize the &ldquo;appeal to nature&rdquo; fallacy.As much as advertising tries to convince us that anything &ldquo;natural&rdquo; must be safe, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.Everyone knows not to go out and randomly pick mushrooms to eat, we call the plant &ldquo;poison&rdquo; ivy for a reason, and we rush to the hospital if we are bitten by a venomous snake or spider.It should also be no surprise to anyone that coal is one of the things the EPA <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home"">specifically recommends not putting on your compost pile.</a></p>

<p>Rep. Dush may call it &ldquo;compost,&rdquo; but coal can contain arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, cyanide, lead, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and a host of other toxic and radioactive chemicals. When burnt, it releases tons of cancer-causing fine particulates, precursors of ozone smog, the sulfur dioxide that leads to acid rain, and carbon pollution that contributes to climate change.Afterwards, we are left with vast amounts of toxic ash that must be disposed of.</p>

<p>In addition to the new pollution coal is responsible for every day, Pennsylvania is still struggling to cope with the result of decades of coal use.We have billions of tons of waste coal piles polluting our land and water and, as Rep. Dush even admits, a huge number of streams that were rendered effectively dead because of acid mine drainage.Of all people, our representatives should know the difference between compost and pollution.</p>

<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-98743cb3-7fff-b064-fc09-d48d133ff018""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><span style=""border:none;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:485px;height:365px;""><img height=""365"" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wZMJl4xdoYSz_FvTx5f0AfrxYH1UMg_-AFMYhyNYbvezcrpRrzY7WhfpE33HAkZrYpkHfjbHI6O3cJMusIS9wbyODg230_UshuYlUzh8c5OxxFJHbD6lyU_D9b0dOnNNmJNvjCmi"" style=""margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;"" width=""485"" /></span></span></span></p>

<p><em>Above: More than 45 tons of acid along with thousands of pounds of aluminum and manganese drain from the Jeddo Tunnel into the Little Nescopeck and into the Susquehanna River every day.</em></p>

<p>Frackedgas may contain fewer toxics and heavy metals as coal, but it&rsquo;s hardly safe either.We know waste from drilling operations contains toxic and radioactive material, but the scary part is what we don&rsquo;t know.A 2018 report <a href=""https://www.pfpi.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PASecretFrackingChemicalsReportPFPI9.10.2018.pdf"">on the use of trade secret rules</a> to avoid disclosing the chemicals used in the drilling process noted that secret chemicals were used in more than half of the wells drilled.</p>

<p>In 2019, Trump&rsquo;s Environmental Protection Agencyissued its recommendation <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-04/documents/management_of_exploration_development_and_production_wastes_4-23-19.pdf"">to exempt oil and gas waste from regulation</a> under the Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)&mdash;despite explicitly saying that exemption &ldquo;does not mean that these wastes cannot cause harm to human health.&rdquo; The rationale for this exemption included the claims that regulation could create &ldquo;delays for exploration and production operations&rdquo;, and perhaps more tellingly that &ldquo;the large waste volumes generated could severely strain capacity at existing Subtitle C facilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How large are these waste volumes?We know data from the PA Department of Environmental Protection indicates that in 2018 alone over 230,000 tons of waste from oil and gas operations was disposed of in Pennsylvania landfills. This included drill cutting, contaminated soil, spent lubricants, and drilling fluid waste along with other chemicals and radioactive materials. Of course, when Rep. Dush testified that he is &ldquo;not too far from a massive landfill&rdquo; and he doesn&rsquo;t want to see &ldquo;negative environmental impacts&rdquo; from disposing of solar panels, he made no mention of the existing waste problem from the natural gas industry.</p>

<p>In order to generate 230,000 tons of waste from solar panels we would need to throw away about seven times the number solar panels installed in Pennsylvania today&mdash;and repeat that again year after year.In reality panels can have an expected life of more than thirty years, so the actual number that are taken out of service in any one year is tiny.To even get close to the volume of waste created by fracking, we would need several hundred times the amount of solar as we have today and decide, for some reason, to recycle none of the panels when they are retired.</p>

<p>No energy source can ever be perfect, but from an environmental perspective solar is pretty good. More than 90 percent by weight of solar panels is glass, plastic, and aluminum, which is already recyclable and not considered hazardous waste.Everyone agrees that the small amount of other compounds like silver, tin, lead, and other trace compounds need to be either disposed of properly or recycled.Fortunately the rare elements also tend to be commercially valuable so there is a lot of <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-020-0645-2.epdf?sharing_token=gTbOszbDSFo3DPHaqB2oKtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OtL9QEzcgFMYa45OUzo4NruhWqFy6wgWcztDdWim4XS3hCVOCBhp4d3QDIeKJkRd1qE3jMWfn99b10OTnspoqOjZXZdVAs0r5jaR6vhHiEl_Yr8DM9BCYUFb15u73ruAc%3D"">interest and research in developing effective recycling technology.</a></p>

<p>Even with the appropriate technology in place, recycling can&rsquo;t be cost-effective unless there is a sufficient stream of material to process. This is one area where the long life span of solar systems creates a challenge.As the market for solar grows, so will the recycling businesses. But, instead of irresponsibly spreading fear and doubt while shilling for fossil fuels, our legislators could work to advance solar generation and, in doing so, welcome this new supporting industry to the state.</p>

"Trump's Energy Secretary Denies Human-Made Climate Change, Promotes Petrochemicals During Beaver County Visit",9/28/2020,"<p>As the election approaches, it seems national politics have converged on Southwestern Pennsylvania, each visiting politician equipped with a different sales pitch for opposing futures.</p>

<p>When U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette visited earlier this week, his vision was unambiguous. The Shell petrochemical complex in Beaver County, Brouillette said, is the &ldquo;future of the American economy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What his vision didn&rsquo;t include, however, was even a basic understanding of climate change. In response to questions about the scientific consensus of human-caused climate change, <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/09/21/trumps-energy-secretary-questions-mainstream-science-on-human-impacts-of-climate-change/"">he arrogantly responded that &ldquo;no one knows that.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>The secretary is right about one thing, though: A petrochemical future requires absolute climate denial. This is because the petrochemical industry <a href=""https://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/09/04/opinion/sorry-break-it-you-futures-not-plastics"">intends to double its carbon emisssions</a> just as other industries and sectors get serious about taking climate action.</p>

<p>According to Brouillette, it is unrealistic to even consider serious climate action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today in the marketplace, renewable power is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels and nuclear technology,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/story/news/2020/09/21/u-s-secretary-energy-beaver-county/5855131002/"">he told reporters</a>. &ldquo;No one wants to say that out loud because it sounds politically incorrect at times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead, his Department has taken an &ldquo;all of the above&rdquo; approach to energy development that, in practice, means climate denial, understating the potential of renewable technologies, and an all-out endorsement of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>As if having a climate change-denying energy secretary wasn&rsquo;t enough, Brouillette quickly showed that he lacks even a basic understanding of our economy.</p>

<p>The petrochemical industry that he touts as &ldquo;the future of the American economy&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/2020/04/16/oil-gas-petrochemical-financial-woes-pandemic-ciel-report"">was under extreme financial duress even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit</a>. It&rsquo;s an industry that <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fracked-Gas-and-Petrochemical-Industries-Jockeying-for-Stimulus-Recovery-Funds"">relies on taxpayer handouts merely to stay afloat</a>, an industry dependent upon <a href=""https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Big-Oils-Risky-Plastic-Bet-Could-Lead-To-400-Billion-In-Stranded-Assets.html"">a nearly impossible increase in plastics demand.</a> Faced with pending market oversupply, billions of dollars worth of petrochemical projects <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2020/07/13/petrochemical-projects-on-hold.html"">have already been abandoned or put on hold.</a></p>

<p>To obscure the ongoing failures of the fracked gas and petrochemical industry, Brouillette <a href=""https://triblive.com/opinion/dan-brouillette-and-peter-navarro-trumps-manufacturing-energy-revival-supports-pa-workers/"">grossly exaggerates the number of Pennsylvania oil and gas jobs</a>, using an <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/09/10/at-western-pa-gas-drilling-site-pence-talks-jobs-repeats-falsehoods-on-bidens-fracking-position/"">oft-repeated and debunked claim</a> that overstates the number by at least 600 percent. He then falsely claims that the petrochemical industry <a href=""https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/cracked-case-green-jobs-over-petrochemicals-pennsylvania"">would bring up to 100,000 new jobs to Pennsylvania.</a></p>

<p>In contrast to petrochemicals, the renewable energy sector continues to grow exponentially, far outpacing the growth of <a href=""https://e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-pennsylvania-2019/"">shale gas and oil in job creation</a> and <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/15/renewable-energy-is-growing-fast-in-the-u-s-but-fossil-fuels-still-dominate/#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20decade%2C%20solar,of%20any%20U.S.%20energy%20source.&amp;text=Still%2C%20solar%20accounted%20for%20only,by%20wind%2C%20wood%20and%20biofuels."">energy generation</a>. With only 4 percent of U.S. energy consumption attributed to solar and wind, there is plentiful opportunity &ndash; some might even say necessity &ndash; for future growth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the fact that the fossil fuel industry has been forced into a nationwide stagnation resulting <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/how-top-oil-companies-are-responding-to-the-price-shock-2020-3"">in layoffs</a>, <a href=""https://ieefa.org/sp-u-s-oil-and-gas-industry-distressed-debt-now-at-all-time-high/"">debt,</a> and <a href=""https://www.visualcapitalist.com/tracking-the-growing-wave-of-oil-gas-bankruptcies-in-2020/"">bankruptcy</a> has not deterred Brouillette&rsquo;s enthusiasm, even as the so-called &ldquo;energy companies&rdquo; increasingly turn towards non-energy products like plastics, fertilizers, and other chemicals for profit growth.</p>

<p>Yet Brouillette and his Department of Energy continue to promote the development of an Appalachian petrochemical hub, despite or perhaps because of the industrys continued struggle to get off the ground.</p>

<p>Secretary Brouillette&rsquo;s personalized tour of the Shell Petrochemical Plant last week was in fact preceded <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/articles/appalachian-energy-and-petrochemical-renaissance"">by a June 2020 report</a> on the future of petrochemicals in Appalachia, stressing the necessity of maximizing public support for the industry. The report says that regional petrochemical growth requires the public sector to abandon its &ldquo;business-as-usual&rdquo; approach and embrace the industry with public (i.e. taxpayer) investment, supportive policies, and propaganda about the potential economic opportunity.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, this means <a href=""https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/shell-cracks-pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-tax-code#:~:text=The%20legislation%20did%20not%20name,what%20Shell%20plans%20to%20do."">a $1.65 billion tax break for Shell Petrochemicals</a>, a <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/07/14/Pennsylvania-petrochemical-tax-credit-fertilizer-dry-natural-gas-Marcellus-Utica-fracking/stories/202007140122"">$667.5 million tax break for qualifying petrochemical plants</a>, and a persistent misinformation campaign about <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/frack-check-trump-inflates-pennsylvania-fracking-job-figures-by-3500-percent/Content?oid=17937555"">the number of fracking jobs in the state.</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The competitive aspects of [the Shell Petrochemical Plant] is just enormous,&rdquo; he assured reporters last week, as his dystopian vision of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s future materialized before his eyes. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see competitors to Shell show up in the very near future.&rdquo;</p>

LNG in PA Blog #5: Public opposition grows to proposed LNG shipping terminals,9/25/2020,"<p>Before New Fortress Energy announced their risky plan to ship millions of gallons of liquified natural gas across the state&rsquo;s rail lines, perhaps they should have consulted with the emergency responders who would have to clean up a spill or one of many other potential catastrophes the project could bring.</p>

<p>With no risk assessment, no public safety analysis and no environmental review of the potential hazards to communities along the possible LNG transport routes, a growing chorus of local officials are denouncing the New Fortress Energy plan and insisting that state regulators stop the scheme in its tracks.</p>

<p>Over the past month, resolutions opposing the local transportation of LNG by rail or truck were approved by <a href=""https://legistarweb-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/pdf/694747/Resolution-2020_Opposing_Transportation_of_Liquefied_Natural_Gas.pdf"">Scranton City Council</a> and <a href=""https://delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/copies_four_reso.pdf"">Clarks Summit Borough Council</a> in Lackawanna County, <a href=""https://delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/copies_four_reso.pdf"">Kutztown Borough Council</a> in Berks County, and the <a href=""https://delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/copies_four_reso.pdf"">Lehigh County Board of Commissioners</a>. Similar concern is being raised by four at-large members of <a href=""https://delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/letter from officials in Philly.pdf"">Philadelphia City Council</a> and a member of the Pennsylvania House representing Northeast Philadelphia, citing the overwhelming hazards to residents with no benefits.</p>

<p>In addition to denouncing the inherent risks of LNG ground transport, these resolutions and letters of opposition are requesting the Delaware River Basin Commission deny New Fortress Energy&rsquo;s permit to build an LNG shipping terminal. If approved, the Gibbstown, New Jersey terminal would be the last major hurdle for <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-4-Liquified-Natural-Gas-Should-Not-Become-the-New-Bomb-Trains-to-Threaten-Our-Communities"">so-called &ldquo;bomb trains&rdquo; to carry dangerous LNG</a> through unprepared communities from a proposed facility in Wyalusing, Bradford County.</p>

<p>PennFuture joined with over 120 other organizations in demanding that the DRBC, the multi-state regulatory agency tasked with protecting waters of the Delaware River, reject the permit that would allow LNG to be exported from an expanded Gibbstown facility. The DRBC also received more than 71,000 petition signatures to stop the project.</p>

<p>Clearly, public opposition is having an effect. Earlier this month, three of the state commissioners <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/philadelphia-lng-gibbstown-new-fortress-energy-port-drbc-fracking-trains-20200920.html"">voted to delay approval and to stay any further construction</a> until DRBC issues a final permit decision.</p>

<p>PennFuture welcomes the decision by the governors of Delaware, New Jersey and New York (Pennsylvania abstained) to take a &ldquo;careful look&rdquo; at the dangers of LNG.</p>

<p>Shipping LNG by rail or by train is dangerous on multiple levels. In addition to the risks of an accident during transport, LNG opens new markets to fracked gas, perpetuating the industry&rsquo;s disastrous environmental footprint throughout Pennsylvania. LNG production and distribution results in greater emissions, hazards and energy use by adding major steps to the supply chain between well heads and consumers.</p>

<p>As the region determines our energy future, neither the Wyalusing production facility or Gibbstown shipping terminal should be part of the path forward. DRBC and local and state leaders should listen to public concern and prevent these wrong-minded projects from moving ahead.</p>

Stonycreek River Restoration Shows Power of Conservation Efforts,9/16/2020,"<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: Melissa Reckner is one of 11 amazing women being honored during PennFuture&rsquo;s 2020 <strong>&ldquo;Women in Conservation&rdquo;</strong> event on Oct. 8. For more information, and for ticket info, <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/wic2020virtual/index.html"">please click this link now!</a></em></p>

<p>Growing up along the Stonycreek River in northern Somerset County, I experienced a waterway that was orange, slimy, and largely devoid of life.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, I can go back to those riverbanks and overlook a much cleaner Stonycreek<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>one that harbors a growing diversity of fish, attracts whitewater enthusiasts from over a dozen states, and is often heralded as a &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; success story.</p>

<p>However, this fairy tale is far from over.</p>

<p>In 2018, I published the <a href=""https://conemaughvalleyconservancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SOW_FINALElectronic.pdf"">State of the Kiski-Conemaugh River Watershed: Community Shift</a>, a document that quantified changes in this 1,888 square-mile watershed, which includes the Stonycreek River. This document shows how water chemistry and fish assemblages have changed in this basin&rsquo;s major rivers and highlights the watershed organizations that work with local, state, and federal agencies to make streams healthier, net alkaline, diverse, and attractive.</p>

<p>Many people have commented how they did not think this could happen in their lifetime and proves that Mother Nature just needs a helping hand, which has come from countless professional and volunteer hours, millions of dollars, and dozens of projects.</p>

<p>While treatment systems have remediated a lot of Abandoned Mine Drainage (AMD)<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>once the number one source of pollution in Western Pennsylvania - these systems require routine maintenance and do have life spans that must be addressed before they fail.</p>

<p>Flushing pipes, removing animal obstructions, replenishing compost and limestone, collecting samples, cutting vegetation, and similar chores are not necessarily fun tasks, but they are necessary in keeping these life-sustaining projects going. Even one day of failure could kill aquatic life, coat streams with iron and aluminum oxides, and ruin decades of work and restoration.</p>

<p>The work of ensuring this does not happen often falls to watershed associations, conservation districts, and similar organizations that don&rsquo;t necessarily have the funds, expertise, or staff to see to these tasks.</p>

<p>Partnerships help alleviate the pressure, but many are in the same boat<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>trying to do a lot with a little and often with an aging volunteer base. And despite years of education and awareness, there is still a disconnect between those communities downstream<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>the ones receiving the benefits of labor completed in headwater streams with some contributors aligning their areas of interests to political, not geographic boundaries or grantors wanting to fund the new, hip project, when basic operations and maintenance are needed.</p>

<p>Watershed groups and similar organizations will continue to see to these tasks, while trying to be innovative, fresh, and creative, but they could use support through the gifting of individuals&rsquo; time, talents, and treasures. We all live in a watershed and there are many ways in which people may get involved.</p>

<p>People are needed to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Serve on organizational boards so business may be conducted</li>
	<li>Generate enthusiasm and new ideas</li>
	<li>Assist with research, construction, or service projects</li>
	<li>Use their connections and solicit memberships and donations</li>
	<li>Write and manage grants &ndash; do the paperwork and spreadsheets!</li>
	<li>Maintain the group&rsquo;s social media presence</li>
	<li>Correspond with local and regional media</li>
	<li>Plan and help with events, like litter cleanups or recycling days.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone has a skill set that can be beneficial to conservation organizations. No doubt, picking up litter, for example, is not the most fun, but working with a great group of people makes it more enjoyable and the feeling of satisfaction afterwards is very rewarding.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not all work and no play! Celebrations are necessary to pause and promote reflection on hard-fought accomplishments, recognize the story this work is fashioning, strengthen the sense of comradery that comes from working with awesome people, and share the joy in knowing the world is a little better because a watershed group believed it could make a difference. They are also an opportunity to look to the future, theorizing ways our environment and people&rsquo;s connection to it could be stronger. Plus, you need days to reap the rewards of your work and restore your soul; maybe cast a line and do an informal &ldquo;fish survey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been blessed to work and volunteer with organizations that spearheaded restoration projects and initiatives that have brought life back to my Stonycreek<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>a river that I still call home<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>and many more waterways, and I&rsquo;m driven to see more stream miles restored.</p>

<p>There are a couple significant tributaries to the Stonycreek, for instance, that have seemingly insurmountable pollution problems, but I think fairy tales can come true with hard work, passion, and persistence.</p>

"Despite roadblocks from Legislature, RGGI rulemaking process advances",9/15/2020,"<p>In February, <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fallacy-Fiction-and-Falsehoods-Debunking-RGGI-Myths-Part-1"">PennFuturewrote a blog post</a> debunking a number of myths surrounding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s future participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). In the seven months since that time, we have some more modeling data and new insights into the benefits of RGGI, but the fossil fuel industry and their friends are still spreading many of the same myths, and sometimes outright lies, to kill the program before it starts.</p>

<p>Particularly in the Legislature, the bias is so blatant it would be comical if the issue was not so serious.Representative Daryl Metcalfe has held several hearings in the House Environmental Resources and Energy committee where he only invited notorious climate deniers, fossil fuel industry advocates, and anti-RGGI speakers to attend. Rep. Metcalf also angrily upbraided the committee&rsquo;s minority chair for pointing out the minority wasn&rsquo;t given the customary courtesy of inviting speakers or even making opening remarks.</p>

<p>The Senate followed this pattern by having a hearing that they pretended was about the impacts of RGGI on employment, but didn&rsquo;t invite any of the hundreds of employees from the Beaver Valley nuclear plant whose jobs have already been saved by RGGI.They also ignored the fact that RGGI is expected to result in a net increase of 27,000 Pennsylvania jobs and didn&rsquo;t talk to anyone from the industries that will see the most growth, they only talked to workers in a limited subset of the fossil fuel industry.</p>

<p>The Legislature didn&rsquo;t stop there.They have also pushed bills not just to limit the DEP&rsquo;s authority to adopt a cap-and-invest program, but also to stop practically any action at all to address the growing climate crisis.Fortunately, while these bills passed in the Legislature, they didn&rsquo;t garner the support of two-thirds of the legislature so it is doubtful proponents will garner enough votes to override Governor Wolf&rsquo;s expected veto.</p>

<p>Although the RGGI proposal has already received unprecedented scrutiny before external reviewers, advisory committees, the Legislature, and in the media, we constantly hear the refrain from the opposition that the people need to have their voice heard.As those making such claims should know, the Regulatory Review Act (RRA) has detailed requirements for just such public participation.</p>

<p>The fact this was always a disingenuous claim intended to disrupt the process is clear. The Environmental Quality Board (EQB) was asked on September 15, 2020 to formally open a public 60-day public comment period and hold at least five public hearings on the proposed rule (both more than what is required under the RRA) and the opposition opposed doing so.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a majority of the EQB members did see the need to initiate the full public participation process and voted to formally propose the rule. With that vote the DEP can move forward and give everyone the opportunity to submit written comments or testify at one of several public hearings.These comments&mdash;along with responses provided by the DEP&mdash;will all become part of the official record as the package moves forward and will also be made available to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that, as much as the fossil fuel industry and their friends try, they cannot refute the fundamental truth that coal generation is failing in Pennsylvania and nationwide because it can&rsquo;t compete with cheaper alternatives&mdash;primarily natural gas but increasingly wind and solar energy as well. They may lie to workers and pretend that these coal jobs will be around for years to come, but their actions of the industry and those of their financiers speak louder than words. If they believed that coal could be competitive, we would see investments in new plants&mdash;we aren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Some may hope new technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) will make it possible to burn coal without emitting huge amounts of greenhouse gasses, but for all its potential benefits, CCS isn&rsquo;t going to make coal generation cheaper. Ignoring the facts and wishing things were different won&rsquo;t reverse the decline of coal generation.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we have the opportunity to invest in sustainable alternatives, which can happen by implementing a cap-and-invest program compatible with RGGI as the EQBhas just proposed. As Senator Santarsiero pointed out at the EQB meeting, polls <a href=""https://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/new-pa-poll-72-of-pennsylvania-voters.html"">have repeatedly shown</a> that strong majorities of Pennsylvanian&rsquo;s support strong policies like these to promote clean air and cut carbon pollution.Now is the time for their voices to be heard.</p>

<p>The Legislature could, of course, play a constructive role in reducing carbon emissions, providing sustainable jobs for our workers, and supporting communities impacted by the inevitable closure of coal-fired power plants.Two bills have been introduced that would do just that&mdash;SB15 (Costa) in the Senate and HB 2856 (Comitta) in the House both take just such an approach.</p>

<p>PennFuture looks forward to championing both bills, and the ongoing rulemaking process surrounding the proposed cap-and-invest program in Pennsylvania.</p>

LNG in PA Blog #4: Liquified Natural Gas Should Not Become the New Bomb Trains to Threaten Our Communities,9/9/2020,"<p>Communities across Eastern Pennsylvania are at the center of a new debate over whether fracked gas and its byproducts, specifically liquified natural gas (LNG), can be safely produced and transported to new markets. As the LNG project in Bradford County moves ahead, the debate will morph into an experiment in freight design and fuel transport. Put simply, those who live along Pennsylvania&rsquo;s rail lines will be at risk.</p>

<p>Following federal approval in July, the first bulk transport of LNG by rail will potentially travel from Wyalusing to an export terminal in Gloucester County, New Jersey, crossing through the Wyoming, Lehigh and Delaware valleys along the way.</p>

<p>On August 18, <a href=""https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/state-impact/press-publications/press-releases/lng-by-rail-challenge"">Pennsylvania joined 14 state attorney generals</a> to sue the federal government on grounds that shipping LNG by rail is absurdly dangerous. On the same day, <a href=""https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LNG-by-Rail-enviros-petition-for-review.pdf"">a coalition of environmental groups</a> likewise challenged the health and safety of the U.S. Department of Transportation&rsquo;s new LNG-by-rail regulations.</p>

<p>Petitioners argue LNG transport rules, finalized by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) on July 24, fail to offer sufficient public safety rules and lack evaluation of environmental impacts. Attorney General Josh Shapiro described LNG rail transport as &ldquo;extremely dangerous&rdquo; and potentially &ldquo;explosive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Transporting LNG would risk creating &ldquo;bomb trains,&rdquo; posing new hazards to communities and habitats along its path. Read PennFuture&rsquo;s previous articles <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">describing thebasics of LNG</a> and <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">detailing the threats posed by transporting LNG on rail.</a></p>

<p>The PHMSA rule <a href=""https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=PHMSA-2018-0025-0480"">allows LNG to travel by rail in tanker cars</a> never before used to transport LNG. DOT-113 cars would need to add enhanced, thicker carbon steel outer tanks. These enhancements would make the cars heavier than almost any other freight. How these enhanced tanker cars would withstand a rail accident remains unknown.</p>

<p>Bomb trains would be subject to a new speed limit of up to 50 mph. Yet the limit would be voluntary. Federal Railroad Administration officials have noted tank cars are unlikely to survive impacts at even 30 mph.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=PHMSA-2018-0025-0078"">The National Transportation Safety Board</a> and <a href=""https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=PHMSA-2018-0025-0096"">the National Association of State Fire Marshals</a> have both objected to the PHMSA rule. PHMSA claims DOT-113 cars have a track record of transporting other cryogenic flammable materials. But these cars have experienced numerous failures while transporting other, less dangerous cargoes.</p>

<p>A study by <a href=""https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/newsletterdl.aspx?id=460"">University of Wyoming professor Charles Mason</a>&mdash;paid for by the Charles Koch Foundation&mdash;acknowledges the danger of rail transport of crude oil. From 2010 to 2016, the study tracked 75 oil spill incidents. Although the spill rate has fallen in recent years, at its peak rail-related spills occurred once for every 1-2 million barrels (about 90 million gallons) shipped.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania LNG plant developer, New Fortress Energy, plans to ship 3.5 million gallons of LNG per day by either freight or truck. That&rsquo;s equivalent to three rail tank cars per day. Recently, <a href=""http://www.lrwy.net/index.php/latest-news"">Lehigh Railway announced a five-year lease</a> to TranZ, &ldquo;a bulk material handling company serving the needs of the energy industry,&rdquo; to operate a rail-truck transfer station in Wyalusing.</p>

<p>The exact route LNG trains would take is not yet public information, <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/ongoing-issues/lng-gibbstown-interactive-map"">but Delaware Riverkeeper Network maps out</a> two potential routes.</p>

<p>From the Wyalusing plant, Lehigh Railway would carry the bomb trains until the railway interchanges with the Reading &amp; Northern Railroad lines at Mehoopany in Wyoming County. From there, trains would likely travel alongside the Susquehanna River through Lackawanna and Luzerne counties, then south through Carbon, Schuylkill and Berks counties. Once arriving in Reading, cargo would travel along a Norfolk Southern line to Philadelphia or via Trenton. <a href=""https://gis.penndot.gov/BPR_pdf_files/MAPS/Statewide/parail.pdf"">See the Pennsylvania Railroad Map.</a></p>

<p>PennFuture fully supports this litigation aimed at protecting our communities and environment from the threat of bomb trains carrying the highly explosive LNG. We will be sure to update you with any information and will continue to do all we can to limit this threat from LNG in Pennsylvania.</p>

LNG in PA Blog #3: Protect Northern PA,9/3/2020,"<p><em>Editors Note: This is the third installment of the LNG in PA blog series. The first blog answered the question, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">What is Liquefied Natural Gas?</a> and the second blog, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-2-Bomb-Trains-Through-Pennsylvania"">Bomb Trains Through Pennsylvania</a>, revealed the dangers of transporting LNG by rail.In this blog, guest writer and PennFuture board member Diana Dakey shares her experiences in the ongoing fight against the construction of a dry LNG facility in Bradford County, PA.</em></p>

<p>In the second half of 2019, news slowly trickled out that a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) plant was permitted by DEP and received the necessary zoning conditions from Wyalusing Township in Bradford County, PA.</p>

<p>People in surrounding counties who learned about the project argued the public was not consulted in the decision-making process to put up an industrial plant that will impact several counties and two states.Concerned people started researching the issue and formed a committee: Protect Northern PA.</p>

<p>As we considered what to call ourselves, we agreed that the concept of protection is key. If a massively dangerous project could (and did) get approved, what else might?</p>

<p>Protect Northern PA realized that the threat is fracked-gas industrialization.There is a harmful feedback loop at play in Northern PA. Cheap and plentiful fracked gas attracts industrial promoters who want to process that gas.The fracking companies need to find new outlets for their gas. As Pennsylvania allows gas processing plants to be built, demand for fracking increases. The feedback loop is established.</p>

<p>A company called New Fortress Energy LLC, with a local subsidiary called Bradford County Real Estate Partners LLC, is poised to start building an LNG plant in the historic Browntown district of Wyalusing Township, between Route 6 and the Susquehanna River.Valuable historical resources are being lost. Browntown was the site of the Friedenshutten settlement of Moravians and Susquehannocks in the 1700s.</p>

<p>Why this project in this place?</p>

<p>The New Fortress Energy scheme claims to have a plan to make LNG from gas brought from local gathering lines and ship it out by rail and/or truck.One way to understand the impact that fracked gas is having on a region is to look at Act 13 payments.Also known as impact fees, Act 13 payments are distributed in part to communities affected by fracked gas.Act 13 payment reports show that this LNG projectis situated among counties where there was high gas production in 2018 and 2019. It is also located near Norfolk Southern rail lines along the Susquehanna River.</p>

<p>As you have been reading, there is an abundance of natural gas, the price is low, so how would gas producers and related industries make money? By exporting it!</p>

<p>LNG is the export form of natural gas.By making a liquid out of a gas, the gas can be transported in containers. This is the form in which gas is moved around the globe.The New Fortress Energy scheme plans to move the LNG by tanker truck or rail from Wyalusing Townshipto a planned export port in Gibbstown, NJ, for export to foreign markets.</p>

<p>The current federal administration is promoting LNG exports, and a presidential executive order directed various federal agencies to expedite LNG export.Promoters of LNG exportation talk about &ldquo;energy independence.&rdquo;The irony is that LNG exporting, by creating more international demand, can actually drive up the price of gas for U.S. consumers and manufacturers. </p>

<p>But exporters can make money for their investors by locking in contracts overseas.</p>

<p>The Marcellus region is being colonized for resource extraction, and Pennsylvanians are exporting greenhouse gasses that exacerbate climate change. A &ldquo;resource curse,&rdquo; occurs where an economy becomes dependent on one industry.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not go there. Instead, let&rsquo;s control what happens to our communities.</p>

<p>The Wyalusing plant, according to our calculation of figures New Fortress Energy told Wyalusing Township, will fill 350 tanker trucks per day, or 15 tanker trucks per hour, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.That is a harmful amount of traffic through Pennsylvania communities.</p>

<p>The LNG may move by rail. In December of 2019, a subsidiary of New Fortress Energy, called Energy Transport Solutions, received a special permit to transport LNG inrail cars.</p>

<p>Whether by tanker truck or rail, the overland transport of this LNG will affect numerous counties and two states by the movement of highly flammable material.</p>

<p>But DEP permits did not look at the environmental harms caused by gas transport.One of the things in the recent Attorney General report that resonates with us is harms caused by truck traffic.DEP permitting does not look at truck traffic related to gas processing facilities or conduct area-wide assessments.</p>

<p>Another lasting impact the Bradford County LNG plant would have is the decades-long continuation of fracking that would have to occur to provide that gas feedstock.Fracking isn&rsquo;t just putting a pipe in the ground. The well pad needs to be constructed. Water needs be drawn from area rivers and streams.Sand needs to be brought in. Fracking waste needs to be taken to a disposal site; new disposal sites may be needed.Then, gas needs to be moved through gathering lines and pipelines to the LNG plant. A compressor station might be needed. </p>

<p>How did this project get permitted?</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, that&rsquo;s easy. Fracking is a legal activity and there is a lot of gas here, with people angling to profit from its extraction and sale.We have a fragmented system of local government, where zoning is done at the municipality level. (Some counties have more county-wide planning than others.) For the Bradford County LNG plant, all it took was for township supervisors to approve conditional use zoning changes.Under the PA municipalities planning code, there is no requirement that one township consult with other municipalities to do this. And forget about consulting with other counties!</p>

<p>The other problem is that very few people are required to be informed about a project.</p>

<p>Something called an Act 14 notice needs to be filed with the municipality where there will be earthmoving. It is for compliance with the NPDES permit &ndash; National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. DEP requires only that the Act 14 notice go to the &ldquo;host&rdquo; municipality and the county.Most counties simply file these notices becausethey have no mandate to advertise.</p>

<p>The New Fortress Energy plant received only two permits: for Air Quality and Site Disturbance. All other activities with the impacts that are ancillary to the LNG plant will be permitted separately to different companies.</p>

<p>Unless your local press is on top of things, the only way to find out what projects are being proposed in your area, is to sign up for DEP&rsquo;s eNOTICES or read the weekly PA Bulletin. Even then, you will not see the relationships of the various parts of the project: such as pipelines, compressor stations, well pads, waste disposal sites, water withdraws, and sand importation.When you go to the DEP eFACTS website, there is no way to connect the dots to one industrial project.</p>

<p>Projects are not only segmented at DEP, they are also segmented among other state agencies. For example, DEP does not coordinate with PennDOT. (Regardless, PennDOT cannot restrict anticipated volumes of traffic or trucks by type.). Pennsylvania has no agency coordinating siting of pipelines. It is all worked out between the pipeline company landmen and landowners. The Susquehanna River Basin Commission approves withdrawals of water for fracking and industrial use.</p>

<p>On the Protect Northern PA website there is information about how you can delve into publicly available sources of information.This lack of area-wide information and input is a major problem that Protect Northern PA wants to address.Public engagement is much needed, especially now that our legislature, wrongly, passed legislation to give tax incentives to petrochemical facilities to use northeastern PA&rsquo;s &ldquo;dry&rdquo; natural gas.</p>

<p>Protect Northern PA doesn&rsquo;t have all the answers, but we encourage the public to engage with us on how communities can build their defenses.Our website launched last month. <a href=""https://protectnorthernpa.org/"">Please check it out.</a>There is a place for individuals to sign up in order to stay in the loop or volunteer with our effort. </p>

<p><em>Protect Northern PA is an alliance of community members, environmental groups, civic organizations, and local businesses formed to critically examine potential air, water, public health, safety, and climate threats from the natural gas industry in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania. We share a concern that a gas-related industrial buildout will negatively and irreversibly change the environment and character of the region.</em></p>

Pennsylvania's Unions Must Look to the Future,9/2/2020,"<p>My maternal and paternal grandfathers were immigrants from Italy.Both worked in coal breakers in the anthracite region of northeast Pennsylvania, cracking and cleaning the raw coal that fueled America and the world.As members of the United Mineworkers of America (UMW), they faithfully paid their dues, and revered John L Lewis.</p>

<p>Both would have been appalled by what we&rsquo;reseeing today&mdash;Pennsylvania&rsquo;s unions willing to give up their hard-fought rights to a healthy workplace and healthy community for jobs.</p>

<p>My understanding of the diverse forces and players that make up the labor movement is gleaned from family stories told by grandfathers and uncles that were involved in the UMW. One told stories of being exploited by mine owners, but also by the unions themselves, especially around election day. Perhaps his illiteracy made him an easy target. Their history mimics the imperfect state history of labor unions, but even myfamily&rsquo;s fraught experience couldn&rsquo;t prepare me for the dualities oftoday&rsquo;s labor movement.</p>

<p>Last week, for the first time in its 14-year history, the Blue Green Alliance&mdash;a collaboration among national environmental and labor interests&mdash;<a href=""https://www.bluegreenalliance.org/the-latest/in-first-ever-presidential-endorsement-bluegreen-alliance-announces-support-for-joe-biden-for-president-and-kamala-harris-for-vice-president/"">endorsed Joe Biden</a> and Kamala Harris for President and Vice President.The alliance cited the campaign&rsquo;s plan to address climate change and create good-paying green jobs to rebuild the economy.</p>

<p>Independent of this joint endorsement, national unions made the same endorsement, including the United Steelworkers of America, United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters, International Union of Bricklayers, and the Utility Workers Union of America.</p>

<p>This union worldview is in stark comparison to what happened a month earlier in our state. The Pennsylvania Building Trades and AFL-CIO unions mounted an intense lobbying effort to win more than $670 million in subsidies to build four facilities that will turn fracked gas into fertilizers and other chemicals. The workers that will construct these facilities are guaranteed union-scale wages through a historic prevailing wage provision in the bill.</p>

<p>But the effort is also supporting the expansion of hardcore chemical manufacturing into more rural parts of Pennsylvania that, to date, have enjoyed relatively toxic-free jobs until fracked gas drilling, pipelines&mdash;and now&mdash;chemical manufacturing was pushed into their backyards. Like the other petrochemical hubs in the United States, these facilities will soak communities and workers in toxics and exacerbate our climate system.</p>

<p>These actions by organized labor&mdash;a few weeks apart&mdash;are not only in competition with each other, but unsustainably opposed.</p>

<p>Despite decades of bitterly fought battles to win workers&rsquo; rights, elements of labor have lost some of its origin story and true north&mdash;that our workforce deserves and can have good paying jobs that don&rsquo;t destroy one&rsquo;s health or pollute their communities.</p>

<p>On the flip side, other elements of labor embrace the opportunity to be part of building a 21st Century economy&mdash;one that is sustainable, equitable, and inclusive. PennFuture is proud to be part of an emerging collaboration to charter a new economic development future<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ReImagineAppalachia/posts/153365683049872"">called Reimagine Appalachia.</a> Their platform is bringing together worker rights, environmental, and justice concerns in ways I have not previously experienced in my decades of environmental work. This approach is having good results with a broad base of endorsements in hand. And we hope one day soon to have organized labor at the table to help shape this platform.</p>

<p>The sentiments expressed <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/commentary/we-shouldnt-have-to-choose-between-a-clean-environment-and-more-jobs-we-can-have-both-opinion/"">in a recent editorial by the principals of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO</a> does little to build bridges or strengthen any semblance of a possible blue green collaboration in this state. Actions speak louder than words and there was nothing inclusive about the &ldquo;bipartisan&rdquo; deal that these actors helped cut behind closed doors to expand petrochemical manufacturing, which the writers conveniently lump into their editorial&rsquo;senergy argument.</p>

<p>The viewpoints therein show a disconnect from the reality of climate change and what truly competitive workforces right now are focusingon: it is not fossil fuels, or an all of the above energy portfolio This is a body that is unprepared to make the really hard choices, but is choosing a climate-sane future really that hard to make?</p>

<p>We can have family-sustaining jobs and a good environment. They&rsquo;re not mutually exclusive. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s unions need to look to the future and not just its dirty past. As it stands now, manystandin direct opposition to what PennFuture and so many of our partners and allies embrace as the needed solutions to meet the climate crisis in a timely way, as guided by science: a break from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The solutions must include devising an economy in Pennsylvania where labor leaders of the future will pursue work opportunities in sustainable sectors that are actually good forthe environment.  </p>

Pennsylvania Continues to Miss Chesapeake Bay Commitments,8/26/2020,"<p>Despite recent planning efforts by the state and a renewed vigor in Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts, Pennsylvania continues to lag behind in its progress reports.</p>

<p>Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-07/documents/pa_2018_2019_2020_2021_final_milestone_evaluation.pdf"">released an evaluation of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s efforts</a> to reduce nitrogen, phosphorous and sediment pollution into the Chesapeake Bay Watershed by 2025. The evaluation found that, once again, Pennsylvania failed to meet its targets for the reporting period.</p>

<p>The evaluation calls out several of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s major shortcomings, including a plan that falls short of nitrogen-reduction milestones by a whopping 9.8 million tons. In addition, 70 percent of developed land across the state continues to be located outside the jurisdiction of municipal stormwater programs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that Pennsylvania has a long way to go.</p>

<p>One of the biggest hurdles in cleaning up our local waterways is the lack of a comprehensive funding strategy. <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/ChesapeakeBayOffice/WIPIII/FinalPlan/PA_Phase_3_WIP_Final.pdf"">Pennsylvania&rsquo;s cleanup plan identified</a> that the state has an annual funding gap of nearly $325 million.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunately not a surprise that Pennsylvania is failing to meet our Chesapeake Bay obligations. The General Assembly continues to attack environmental regulations and funding while failing to provide an adequate funding strategy.</p>

<p>While Pennsylvania has successfully reduced pollution from wastewater treatment plants within the Susquehanna and Potomac watersheds, nitrogen from agricultural runoff continues to account for more than 90 percent of the Bay&rsquo;s 9.8 million ton &ldquo;nitrogen gap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Due in large part to this high concentration of nitrogen pollution, the Bay&rsquo;s overall ecosystem health scored a C- <a href=""https://ecoreportcard.org/report-cards/chesapeake-bay/bay-health/"">in an annual assessment issued in May</a> by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.</p>

<p>More than half of Pennsylvania flows into the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers empty directly into the Bay.</p>

<p>Poor water quality is not a problem uniquely found in the Bay. Upstream, one third of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s streams and rivers suffer from impaired water quality. <a href=""https://www.depgis.state.pa.us/2020_Integrated_Report/"">A draft report on the state&rsquo;s compliance</a> with the federal Clean Water Act finds that the number of impaired stream miles has grown by more than 5,500 miles over the past two years.</p>

<p>We need a new direction.</p>

<p>To lead the way, PennFuture will soon issue a detailed roadmap that outlines policy solutions and funding proposals to help Pennsylvania meet its pollution reduction goals. Our plan offers real and concrete solutions to bridge this funding gap, and offers practical solutions for state policymakers to put Pennsylvania back on track toward meeting our clean water goals.</p>

<p>For Pennsylvania, without adequate funding,the path toward improving water quality in the Chesapeake Bay watershed remains murky, but we are hopeful that our roadmap will illuminate the best way forward. Be sure to stay tuned in the coming weeks when we unveil this new plan for clean water!</p>

Exploring Pennsylvania: Visiting All 121 State Parks in 303 Days,8/25/2020,"<p>Trevor Nordquist thinks every part of Pennsylvania offers something special and beautiful, and he should know: the 27-year-old just visited each of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 121 state parks in a span of 303 days!</p>

<p>From kayaking in <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/CodorusStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Codorus State Park</a> in southwestern York County and <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/BaldEagleStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Bald Eagle State Park</a> in Centre County, to biking in <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/MoraineStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Moraine State Park</a> in Butler County, to hiking in just about every park that offered trails, Nordquist has seen more of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s beauty in the last year than most of us experience in entire lifetimes.</p>

<p>But Nordquist, a graduate student at Slippery Rock University in Butler County, first had to leave Pennsylvania to appreciate its beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Growing up in Pennsylvania, especially when I graduated high school, I wanted out of here,&rdquo; Nordquist recently told PennFuture. &ldquo;I never had an appreciation for this state like I should have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nordquist&rsquo;s journey took him to Colorado as part of the AmeriCorps program, and it was there that he became &ldquo;obsessed with the outdoors.&rdquo; Given ten weeks to explore the state after his service ended, the Pennsylvania native set a goal to hike a &ldquo;Fourteener,&rdquo; or one of the 53mountain peaks in Colorado that exceed 14,000 feet.</p>

<p>After spending the summer of 2019 immersed in training and planning, Nordquist accomplished his goal by climbing Grays Peak in the Rocky Mountains right before coming home to Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The experience, he said, opened his eyes to the natural beauty in Pennsylvania he previously ignored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I returned, I realized that I never gave Pennsylvania any credit for also being beautiful, maybe even more beautiful than a majority of the country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I thought I should explore our state parks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what he did.</p>

<p>Starting on October 15, 2019 at <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/OilCreekStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Oil Creek State Park</a> in Venango County, Nordquist coveredabout 15,000 miles over the next year to see everything Pennsylvania has to offer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I loved every single park that I visited and I&rsquo;m going to start revisiting some beginning this weekend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought each park offered something special. The trails are very well maintained and clearly marked. I think Pennsylvania sets a great example for what a state parks system should look like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Specifically, Nordquist said he was &ldquo;blown away by the beauty&quot; of <a href=""https://pawilds.com/"">the Pennsylvania Wilds</a> areathat includes <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/allegheny"">the Allegheny National Forest</a> and <a href=""https://visitpottertioga.com/explore/attractions/pennsylvania-grand-canyon/"">the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon</a>, among others, as well as the &ldquo;colonial feel&rdquo; of southern Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>His favorite park was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Springs_State_Park"">Salt Springs State Park</a> in far northeastern Pennsylvania, a park that is home to hemlock trees that are over 500 years old and are among the largest trees in all of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Calling it &ldquo;quant with numerous waterfalls and meadows full of wildflowers,&rdquo; Nordquist said it was the highlight of his trip. Not so much for <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/MarshCreekStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Marsh Creek State Park</a> in Chester County, he said, because it was jam-packed with visitors and didn&rsquo;t allow for much in the way of exploration.</p>

<p>Regardless, &ldquo;every part of this state offers us something special, and I hadn&rsquo;t realized that before,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, his journey took a very unexpected turn when the COVID-19 pandemic began unfolding in March. Lockdown orders sent residents outdoors and into state parks in unprecedented numbers, which isn&rsquo;t a bad thing on its face. But then came the enormous amounts of litter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw way too much trash,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Once COVID hit, everyone started to do more outside activities which is great, but they were not mindful of the environment. I started taking a bag with me and picked up after people. I think people think that there are people hired to clean up after them, so they aren&rsquo;t as mindful of their trash, but I really urge people to start cleaning up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another area of concern for Nordquist came when he was reflecting on his journey. Only once during the entire ordeal did he have to worry about driving in snow, which is typically a frequent occurrence during Pennsylvania winters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not common that we only experience one minor snowfall in any given year, and it really opened my eyes to the threat our world faces regarding climate change,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Climate change is a real threat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nordquist finished his impressive feat in mid-August with a visit to <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/SusquehannockStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Susquehannock State Park</a> in Lancaster County. Now back home and able to reflect more intently on his journey, Nordquist said he hopes his experience inspires other Pennsylvanians to appreciate their homeland, but also to respect it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope native Pennsylvanians appreciate where they come from,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Pennsylvania is a great state. But I hope it also brings more awareness to being respectful to nature. I think we need to clean up after one another more. I would love to reach out to my local representatives and have an open discussion with them regarding the topic of environmental protection and my experience and how we can better the state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At PennFuture, we chose to tell Trevor&rsquo;s story for two reasons: it&rsquo;s an impressive story that highlights all of the beauty Pennsylvania has to offer, but it&rsquo;s also a cautionary tale about funding for our abundant state parks.</p>

<p>Now more than ever, it&rsquo;s crucial that our lawmakers maintain funding to these vital resources, especially because Pennsylvanians are flocking to our state parks in record numbers.</p>

<p>However, a contingent of lawmakers in Harrisburg have previously tried cutting funding for our parks, a move we could see again as the General Assembly works to bridge a significant budget deficit made even worse by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In addition, a new bill has been introduced in Harrisburg<span style=""font-family:"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span><a href=""http://www.paenvironmentdigest.com/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=50782&amp;SubjectID="">House Bill 2806</a><span style=""font-family:"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>that would remove the current ban on charging admission and parking fees at our state parks. PennFuture opposes this bill, and any bill that could restrict access to our parks and natural resources.</p>

<p>Rest assured, PennFuture will be pushing back against this bill, as well as any attempts to gut funding for our parks and natural resources once budget discussions begin in the fall.</p>

REFUTED: CNX’s Eight Irrefutable Energy Truths Expose Industry Desperation,8/11/2020,"<p>Recently, CNX published a blog post called <a href=""https://www.cnx.com/newsroom/cnx-tra/news-post?ID=5"">&ldquo;Nine Irrefutable Energy Truths and a Critical Call to Action.&rdquo;</a>Reading the post then&mdash;which I highly suggest you do&mdash;my first reaction was to laugh. Was this a gag? It was so obviously absurd, it was hard to take it seriously at first. But, as I compose my response to the version <a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2020/08/eight-irrefutable-energy-truths-opinion.html"">adapted for Pennlive&rsquo;s Opinion section</a> just last week, the post no longer feels so funny.</p>

<p>As outlandish as it is, Nick DeIuliis&rsquo; opinion piece is a tiny part of a larger, highly sophisticated disinformation campaign that has infiltrated Pennsylvania&rsquo;s everyday reality. While DeIuliis seems to be grasping at straws, the not so funny truth is that these flaccid arguments are starting to gain traction with a public increasingly mistrustful of science. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re debunking these eight irrefutable energy &ldquo;truths&rdquo; with some truths of our own. The main difference: Our truths reflect reality.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #1: The Natural Gas Industry is Floundering</strong></u></p>

<p>As logic would tell you, price stress, oversupply, industry bankruptcy, and cancelled pipelines are indeed a sign of failure, despite CNX&rsquo;s bold claims otherwise. To make this claim, author and CNX Director and Chief Executive Officer Nick DeIuliis tells his readers that the good times are coming, comparing the rough start of the fracked gas industry to the early struggles of the information technology sector. Yet as the oil and gas sector flounders, information technology has continued to be the S&amp;P&rsquo;s best performing sector in the last decade. It shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that <a href=""https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500-energy-sector/#overview"">S&amp;P Energy</a>&mdash;made up of exclusively oil and gas companies&mdash;<a href=""https://ieefa.org/ieefa-update-oil-and-gas-stocks-place-dead-last-in-2019-again-despite-30-price-rise/"">comes dead last.</a></p>

<p>This is what failure looks like.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #2: The Era of Fossil Fuel Dominance is Ending</strong></u></p>

<p>Our society has run on fossil fuels for centuries, shifting from one technology to the next as we innovate and discover new pathways forward: From coal to oil and gas. Yet while fossil fuels have brought us a long way, their exploitation has come at a cost.</p>

<p>Fracked gas is no exception. <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/climate-risks-natural-gas?utm_campaign=tw&amp;utm_medium=tw&amp;utm_source=tw#:~:text=An%20estimated%20one%20to%20nine,replacing%20coal%20with%20natural%20gas."">Projected global warming emissions</a> from natural gas are on par with an energy mix dominated by coal, especially when we consider factors like methane leaks (a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide), increased energy demand over time, and the slow decline of carbon-neutral nuclear power. Worse still, fracked gas and associated petrochemical facilities threaten public health with <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2020/08/02/A-decade-of-water-woes-in-Butler-County/stories/202007310107"">contaminated water</a>, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/climate/gas-flares-premature-babies.html?surface=home-discovery-vi-prg&amp;fellback=false&amp;req_id=749127125&amp;algo=identity&amp;imp_id=983713178&amp;action=click&amp;module=Science%20%20Technology&amp;pgtype=Homepage"">premature births</a>, and <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-string-of-rare-cancer-cases-pennsylvania-investigates-potential-link-to-fracking-11576837802"">unexplained cancers</a>. Communities of color and low-income communities are especially impacted.</p>

<p>Luckily, we now have the technology to continue the progress of centuries prior while improving outcomes for public health, the environment, and justice. As we have done in the past, we will continue to innovate and move forward, to embrace life- and earth-preserving energy conservation and generation like solar and wind. Renewable energy is <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Coal-Outlook-2020_March-2020.pdf"">already forecasted to surpass coal</a> in electricity generation by this year&rsquo;s end and will continue its path forward over the coming decades.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #3: Renewables are Winning</strong></u></p>

<p>One challenge for the renewable energy transition is that our existing policies and infrastructure are built to serve the energy systems of the past. This legacy&mdash;of fossil fuel subsidies, of preference for large-scale over community energy generation, and of fossil fuel influence in politics&mdash;slows down the transition to renewables, but it cannot stop it. <a href=""https://www.c2es.org/content/renewable-energy/#:~:text=Renewable%20energy%20is%20the%20fastest,wind%20power%20(6.6%20percent)."">Renewable energy is growing faster</a> than any other energy source in the U.S. Part of the reason is that its cheap: Just check out the Forbes article titled <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/06/15/renewable-energy-is-now-the-cheapest-option-even-without-subsidies/#1486c0475a6b"">&ldquo;Renewable Energy Is Now The Cheapest Option - Even Without Subsidies.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Despite this spectacular growth in the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition in the U.S., however, supportive policy is still needed. The necessity to shift to renewable energy is more than economical&mdash;it is a moral obligation. The subsidies propping up the flailing fossil fuel industry must be eliminated and replaced with subsidies that help us address the climate crisis, improve public health, and support home-grown jobs.</p>

<p>And, if you&rsquo;re curious about the greenhouse gas emissions of renewable energy from mining all the way to operation, <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/conference/2015/pdf/presentations/skone.pdf"">be sure to read this</a>.Here&rsquo;s a preview: Despite Nick DeIuliis&rsquo; claim, many honest analyses have been performed, and renewables outperform natural gas every time.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #4: A Zero-Carbon Future is Coming</strong></u></p>

<p>According to an article from the Financial Times, <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/conference/2015/pdf/presentations/skone.pdf"">&ldquo;azero-carbon future is both feasible and affordable.&rdquo;</a> While this may be difficult to imagine&mdash;even the production of renewable energy sources emit greenhouse gases from mining and transportation of materials&mdash;this future relies heavily on &ldquo;boosting the role of electricity.&rdquo; In this not so faraway future, mining equipment and vehicles for transportation will run on electricity powered by renewable energy.</p>

<p>One reason that CNX might want to sow doubt about this prospect is that <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2019/11/04/how-to-reach-us-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-decarbonizing-industry/#28baf9f27cb4"">reducing industry emissions</a>&mdash;67 percent of which come from natural gas, petroleum, chemicals, and plastics industries&mdash;will be absolutely critical. When Nick DeIuliis says that &ldquo;outrage should be directed at academia,&rdquo; what he really means is that undermining science is one of the few options fossil fuel industries have left.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #5: Petrochemicals are the Final Frontier for Fossil Fuel Survival</strong></u></p>

<p>The oil and gas industry is trying to leverage the pandemic to reaffirm its role in a world eager to move on, claiming over and over that &ldquo;plastic saves lives&rdquo;&mdash;from surgical gloves and face masks to ventilators. But what the industry isn&rsquo;t telling you is that 59 percent of polyethylene (the type of plastic that the Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County would produce) is actually used to create packaging like food and beverage containers. As prices for oil and gas plummet and alternatives like solar and wind become more competitive, fossil fuel executives are staking their bet on petrochemicals. But as the attractiveness of this industry grows, more companies are jumping on the bandwagon and creating a massive plastics oversupply. Their success, then, relies on you thinking that plastics&mdash;and a whole lot more of them&mdash;are essential.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #6: Commitment to Fossil Fuels Threatens Our Geopolitical Power</strong></u></p>

<p>Fossil fuels like natural gas exacerbate climate change and threaten environmental health domestically&mdash;but the impacts don&rsquo;t stop there. Our undying commitment to fossil fuels is embarrassing us on an international scale. When the United States decided to leave the Paris Climate Agreement, we not only relinquished our role as a global leader on climate change, but we undermined our reputation broadly.</p>

<p>If you need further evidence, look no further than the situation in which we currently find ourselves. Science denialism&mdash;which fuels our failed response to the climate crisis&mdash;is now hampering our response to another issue of international importance: coronavirus. Unless we start taking science seriously and responding to these crises with the urgency they demand, our reputation as a global leader will continue to falter.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #7: A Diversified Economy Sustains the Middle Class</strong></u></p>

<p>Extractive industries have left Pennsylvanian&rsquo;s stranded without jobs time and time again. They set up monopolistic economies reliant upon their success. When profits dry up, companies abandon ship, leaving communities to clean up the health, environmental, and economic mess left in their wake.</p>

<p>This is no way to structure an economy. We need the long-term, life-sustaining jobs of the future, not the dirty jobs of our past. Increasingly, these jobs can be found in industries like energy efficiency, renewable energy, and nature-based small businesses. In fact, despite the fracked gas boom of the past decade, clean energy jobs actually employ twice as many people as the fossil fuel industry in Pennsylvania. The majority of these jobs are in construction and manufacturing.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #8: We Need Your Voice to Combat Industry Mistruths</strong></u></p>

<p>Nick DeIuliis&rsquo; mistruths reek of an industry desperate to stay afloat. It is clear that fossil fuel interests will stop at nothing to ensure their legacy of extracting profits continues for as long as possible, despite the consequences for public health, global warming, and environmental protection. Much of that fight is political. It takes place in our newspapers, our schools, and our capitol.</p>

<p>Just weeks ago, legislators passed a bill which provides $667 million dollars of tax breaks to the petrochemical and fertilizer industries over the next 25 years. Other legislation being considered includes enabling community solar, changing the definition of recycling to include harmful plastic incineration, and establishing more public health safeguards from fracked gas. These decisions will impact the immediate future, and their ramifications will be felt for generations to come.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let industry mistruths dominate the conversation&mdash;talk to you legislator today.</p>

<p>Regardless, as fracked gas companies flounder in the past, we will continue to innovate and move forward, to embrace life and earth-preserving energy conservation and generation like solar and wind. Our very future depends on it.</p>

Senate Bill 15: A New Direction for Pennsylvania,7/30/2020,"<p>The energy industry across the nation is in transition, a fact that is particularly obvious in Pennsylvania. People once talked of &ldquo;king coal,&rdquo; but those days are long gone as new technologies make conventional steam coal plants&mdash;once the mainstay of &ldquo;baseload&rdquo; power&mdash;obsolete and far too expensive.</p>

<p>Politicians like President Donald Trump claim that slashing protections for public health and the environment will bring coal back, but those are nothing but empty campaign promises. Despite an unprecedented number of environmental rollbacks and despite millions of taxpayer dollars wasted on his <a href=""https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-to-be-long-on-electricity-coal-closures-may-accelerate-8211-doe-official-58511969"">&ldquo;coalFirst&rdquo; initiative</a>, coal generation in Pennsylvania is one third what it was the day the President took office.</p>

<p>Ohio tried a different approach with HB6, a bill which charges ratepayers an extra $50 million per year to subsidize coal generation, guts standards for clean renewable generation, and subsidizes nuclear power. Despite praise from the fossil fuel industry at a recent committee hearing hosted by Pennsylvania state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, Ohio&rsquo;s plan is proving to be a spectacular failure. On the very day Rep. Metcalf and his guests were lauding Ohio&rsquo;s approach, Ohio&rsquo;s Speaker of the House was arrested by the FBI on racketeering and bribery charges related to the passage of HB6 and a move to repeal the subsidy program is gaining steam.</p>

<p>Far from coal making a comeback, the few remaining large coal plants in Pennsylvania are all near retirement. No one is investing money in new plants to replace them and many of the traditional coal operators <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063430425"">are fleeing the business</a>. It&rsquo;s long past the time that politicians face the facts. Rather than telling lies and making empty promises, they should focus on serious policies to assist the workers and communities that will be impacted when these plants inevitably close.</p>

<p>In addition, our state leadership now faces an additional challenge in helping the state recover from the COVID-19 crisis. <a href=""/Files/Admin/Green-Stimulus-FINAL.pdf"">As PennFuture recently detailed in a report on the topic</a>, that needs to be a green recovery that does more than just fund traditional polluting sources and hoping benefits trickle down.</p>

<p><u><strong>There is a real plan to move Pennsylvania Forward</strong></u></p>

<p>Senator Costa and a number of co-sponsors have just introduced &ldquo;The Energy Transition and Recovery Act&rdquo; (SB15) that, if passed, would help guide the Commonwealth through the coming energy transition and support our workers and communities as we cut carbon emissions and other harmful pollution.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 15 recognizes that while Governor Wolf has the authority to create a RGGI program on his own though the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the legislature could work with the Governor to make that program more flexible and make a difference for workers and communities.</p>

<p>RGGI is a market-based program that works by creating a cap on carbon pollution from the electric generation industry. Each ton of allowable emissions under that cap is represented by a single allowance. Facilities can take action to lower their emissions, but if they are going to pollute they need to purchase sufficient allowances at auction. The price of those allowances is set by the market and the proceeds come back to Pennsylvania to be invested in various ways.</p>

<p>DEP is currently developing a RGGI program using the authority granted by the Air Pollution Control Act. Once that program becomes operational, the proceeds from the auction will be deposited into the Clean Air Fund and can be used to support the program itself or be invested in ways that reduce air pollution. That alone can do a lot of good, generating over $2 billion over the first decade of the program, but with the assistance of the Legislature the program could be much more flexible in how the proceeds are used.</p>

<p>Particularly, it is important to provide support to workers and communities that will be impacted by the transition away from coal which is already happening regardless of RGGI. The right thing to do is help communities move away from a reliance on the dying coal industry and toward more prosperous economic activities, including modernizing their skill sets to be compatible with our 21st century economy and incentivizing new industries with long-term growth potential.</p>

<p>The DEP would implement the RGGI program in the same way, but investments of the net proceeds under SB15 would be guided by an energy transition plan. A quarter of the proceeds would still go to the Clean Air Fund, but the remainder would go into a newly created Energy Transition Fund and used for certain types of projects in key categories:</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 40px;"">35% &ndash; Programs to support workers and communities<br />
15% &ndash; Bill assistance for low-income customers<br />
20% &ndash; Weatherization assistance programs<br />
30% &ndash; Solar generation, energy efficiency, and energy demand reduction</p>

<p>While the legislation specifies the categories for funding and the broad goals of the program, the details of what projects are funded and where community support would be prioritized would be guided by an Energy Transition Plan. This plan will be developed by the state agencies involved in transition planning after an extensive public participation process that includes hearings in impacted communities and fossil fuel producing regions of the commonwealth.</p>

<p>The plan must also be approved by a board consisting of agency members, legislative appointees, and representatives of environmental justice areas, labor groups, clean energy companies, energy consuming industries, and others.</p>

<p><u><strong>With this bill, Pennsylvania will be an innovator</strong></u></p>

<p>All the existing RGGI states make investments in energy efficiency, and most also invest in renewable energy and energy bill assistance as well. That has proven to be a success. A recent independent report found that in the first 10 years of the program those investments returned over $5.4 billion in net benefits resulting from $3.2 billion in revenue generated by the RGGI program, producing 1.78 times the benefits compared to the monies invested.</p>

<p>While many of the programs deployed by RGGI states contain implicit job-creation benefits, especially in the areas of renewable energy development and weatherization, the SB15 plan builds on this foundation but goes even further by investing in education, outreach, and job training. Other RGGI states spend an average of just 2 percent on those areas, where this bill would devote 26.25 percent of total proceeds to these efforts. This bill also requires that, in making those investment decisions, the state seek meaningful input and consultation from environmental justice communities as well as labor groups.</p>

<p>This recognition that environmental justice is a key issue for any successful plan is part of a growing trend across states. New Jersey, Maryland, and New York have already taken steps in that direction, but Pennsylvania has the opportunity to show real leadership.</p>

<p>The conventional wisdom may be that the politics of the Pennsylvania Legislature and opposition from fossil-fuel interests will keep SB15 from getting any traction. If so, that will be a big loss for our workers and communities. We have an opportunity to innovate and grow a sustainable economy that will not only help our current recovery, it will keep Pennsylvania an energy leader in the future. </p>

"PennFuture's ""Democracy for All"" Program At Work in Pennsylvania",7/30/2020,"<p>It is a fact that communities of color are disproportionately impacted by climate change and pollution, and that is not accidental.</p>

<p>Historically, the burden of polluting factories and industries has been placed directly on low-income communities and communities of color, which in turn exacerbates the impacts of climate change on these communities.</p>

<p>These communities not only shoulder outsized burdens from pollution and climate change, but they are often overlooked and underrepresented in all levels of our government and democracy. We steadfastly believe that the key to helping these communities fight for environmental justice is to maximize their power in our democracy.</p>

<p>Too often, environmental organizations just move pollution from one persons backyard to another&rsquo;s. To win this fight, we need to keep the chemicals and pollutants that cause asthma, cancer, and climate change out of Pennsylvania entirely, and we need to amplify the voices within our communities of color to accomplish that.</p>

<p>PennFuture has always focused on protecting our air, water, and land, and empowering all Pennsylvanians to build sustainable communities for future generations. Civic engagement can be the first step in that empowerment, which is why our Democracy For All&mdash;PennFuture program seeks to register many new voters in 2020, primarily in communities of color.</p>

<p>Due to the pandemic, we have had to get creative in how we engage and register new people of color. Not being out in the field has dampened the number of people we can physically register. Not to be deterred, we have gone digital! Our canvassers are all digitally focused on phone banking, texting, and relational texting.</p>

<p>Our Area Directors, while managing the canvassers, will also be focusing on developing relationships with organizations. They will also be encouraging organizations and local events to utilize our tablets to register their members to register to vote.</p>

<p>Our social media strategist will work to develop social media content for the newly formed civic engagement page, our Facebook and Instagram pages as well as creating online events. She will be working closely with PennFuture staff to make our reach as far as possible.</p>

<p>My long term goal for Democracy for All is to be a program that continues to register new people to vote, educates people about the importance of voting, and empowers people to empower themselves.</p>

<p>I would like to introduce you to the Democracy for All team:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shavon Ferguson - Area Director for northeast Pennsylvania with a focus on Lackawanna, Schuylkill, Monroe, and Luzerne counties.</li>
	<li>Josie Lopez - Area Director for southeast Pennsylvania with a focus on Northampton, Lehigh, Dauphin, and Berks counties.</li>
	<li>Carrie Myers - Social Media Strategist with a focus on branding the Democracy for All - PennFuture name and engaging audiences on social media and other platforms.</li>
	<li>Erlinda Aguiar - Quality Control/Quality Analyst will be making sure that we are compliant on all fronts and analyzing data to see how well we are digital engaging with targeted communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic upending our plans for the Democracy for All program, we are forging full-steam ahead with this important and crucial work!</p>

A New Coalition for a Better Future,7/29/2020,"<p>As of July 23, 2020, it&rsquo;s official&mdash;Pennsylvania has a law that will award four lucky petrochemical or fertilizer manufacturing entities each $6.6 million a year in tax credits for 26 years to set up shop here.</p>

<p>Like the $1.65 billion subsidy the state handed Shell for its Beaver County cracker plant, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fracked gas industry will once again enjoy the largesse of Pennsylvania taxpayers. The fracked gas industry apparently needs $660 million of the public&rsquo;s help to optimize the use of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Marcellus shale gas into something beyond energy.</p>

<p>This handout will take its product into the climate-killing and health-risking realm of petrochemical, plastics and fertilizer manufacturing. Apparently the fracked gas industry can&rsquo;t succeed on the basis of significant private investments alone.</p>

<p>The legislation that made this all possible&mdash;<a href=""/News-PennFuture-responds-to-passage-of-House-Bill-732"">HB 732</a>, which was originally crafted to help emergency responders and was amended to include the fracked gas industry tax credit&mdash;was a reworking of <a href=""/News-Thirty-five-groups-rally-against-House-Bill-1100"">HB 1100</a>, which also provided a petrochemical subsidy, albeit an open-ended one. That legislation passed both chambers but the Governor vetoed it in March.</p>

<p>The petrochemical industry&rsquo;s friends in the state legislature never attempted to overturn that veto because the environmental community and our partners&mdash;with the help of many of you&mdash;mounted a textbook campaign to call attention to the corporate greed and cronyism that defined that bill. And when the Governor vetoed it, our coalition graciously said thank you, and never spiked the ball to celebrate the formidable victory that it was at the time.</p>

<p>In the end, the fight was among special interests in the state, and legislators chose to do the bidding of the building trade unions and the fracking industry, and not the bidding of mainstream interests that our diverse coalition of environmentalists, community, religious and other business leaders represented.</p>

<p>This law picks winners&mdash;fracked gas, petrochemicals, fertilizers and plastics&mdash;and every other business and industry sector is by omission, a loser, and during a pandemic-induced recession where all sectors need help. As an example, what is the legislature and Governor doing to bolster agriculture and tourism, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s number one and number two industries, respectively?</p>

<p>The deal that became law was struck behind closed doors, by&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;probably mostly white men.I say &ldquo;probably&rdquo; because when environmental leaders like me were asked to be represented at the deal table, we were rejected. Possibly others asked to be part of the conversation and also denied.</p>

<p>I can say with certainty that after the March 9, 2020 rally in the state capitol held by <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fighting-for-Our-Future"">the 35 groups represented in our HB 1100 coalition</a>, a counter rally was held.During that counter-rally, the proponents of taxpayer giveaways for the petrochemical industry reflected predominately white, male demographics.</p>

<p>For the most part, the legislators, industry, economic development and union faces that gathered this past Friday in northeast Pennsylvania to celebrate the Governor&rsquo;s signing of HB 732, media coverage revealed the same predominate demographics.</p>

<p>And we should expect that the &ldquo;800&rdquo; temporary and &ldquo;150&rdquo; permanent jobs that each of the four subsidized petrochemical or fertilizer facilities is supposed to employ will also be mostly, and by a large margin, white and male.</p>

<p>Despite a textbook campaign against HB 1100, the interests of many, many Pennsylvanians who desire an economic break from fossil fuels were not represented at the HB 732 deal table. I am concerned that come 2022, when Pennsylvanians go to the polls to elect a new governor&mdash;possibly our last chance to seat a leader who is climate-aware and willing to lead all Pennsylvanians into a healthier, prosperous and climate-sane future&mdash;wemay not be presented a diverse array of candidates. </p>

<p>We fully appreciate that several early names of possible gubernatorial candidates may very well represent mainstream environmental interests, but no names of women or persons of color are in the rumor mill currently.</p>

<p>My points here and above should not be taken as anti-male, but we simply need more diversity in the legislature and higher offices in our state for things to change. Nor should this redux be taken as sour grapes over the significant loss this was for PennFuture&rsquo;s mission of clean air, water and a healthy climate. It is meant to be a cautionary reminder of how things still work in &ldquo;the People&rsquo;s House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For things to change, Pennsylvania needs a new coalition, and one powerful enough that legislators will forego the powerful payoff of campaign contributions that drive so much of this dysfunctional power dynamic.If we use Pennsylvania&rsquo;s primary election as a data point, we saw several races where powerful labor forces supported challengers to pro-environment incumbents&mdash;many women&mdash;and those challengers lost badly. The electorate is waking up to the dominant political paradigms here and fighting back, but many policymakers lag behind the wishes of Pennsylvanians.</p>

<p>We must come together to forge a different economic road forward, with family sustaining jobs that protect and improve our environment. We must come together for a sane climate future. We must fight for a future state legislature where four-fifths of its members vote in favor of protecting our communities and the environment rather than in favor of a subsidy for an industry that will do exactly the opposite. We need a governor who is not reliant upon fracked gas and petrochemicals, and a legislature that is obligated to the electorate, not to powerful labor interests and greedy fossil fuel corporations who are wringing the entrepreneurial and competitive life out of the rest of us and our futures.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s Democracy for All program is now fully engaged in non-partisan voter registration, voter engagement and get out the vote work. The people of color and their communities, single women and millennials this program is reaching out to may form the basis of this new coalition and help move Pennsylvania forward along a very different and green path.</p>

"PennFuture releases ""A Green Stimulus and Recovery Platform for Pennsylvania"" Report",7/28/2020,"<p>A rampant global health pandemic. A deep and rapid decline in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy that is nearly double that of the Great Recession of 2008. Rising racial inequality. Nearly 3 million Pennsylvanians seeking unemployment benefits since mid-March. Small businesses shuttered&mdash;some permanently&mdash;as Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy struggles to reopen.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s abundantly clear that these are unprecedented times, and that our leaders in all levels of government will have to spend the next several years advancing economic and public health solutions that spur our economy towards recovery.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why PennFuture <a href=""/Files/Admin/Green-Stimulus-FINAL.pdf"">released today a strategic roadmap</a> to guide our leaders to implement a green stimulus recovery plan for Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This 50-page report lays out specific policy recommendations that leverage Pennsylvania&rsquo;s growing nature-based, clean energy, and low-carbon industries to put people back to work and build a more resilient and sustainable economy.</p>

<p>The report has four overarching goals that guide each recommendation made within the document: safely restart Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy in a way that reduces pollution and is protective of human health, avoid state budget cuts that will harm our businesses and slow recovery, target short-term investments that provide family-sustaining wages, and advance long-term investments to support sustainable infrastructure and industries that contribute to resilient, clean and profitable communities.</p>

<p>All told, PennFuture&rsquo;s policy platform is estimated to amount to $2.8 billion in investments, which would preserve or create as many as 389,000 jobs in the Commonwealth, including nearly 37,200 shovel-ready jobs, while also reducing pollution, promoting our natural resources, and advancing public health.</p>

<p>There is evidence to back up the necessity of our green stimulus and recovery platform.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/publications/wpapers/workingpaper20-02.pdf"">a recent study from Oxford University</a> that analyzed 700 separate stimulus policies from the Great Recession, projects that focus dually on economic recovery and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions deliver higher returns on government spending both in the short and long term.</p>

<p>Our leaders also cannot turn to industry to jumpstart this recovery. Carbon dioxide emissions <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-green-stimulus-clean-energy-future/"">skyrocketed by 5.1 percent in 2009</a> when America&rsquo;s economy finally started to bounce back from the Great Recession. It is indisputable that Pennsylvania, similar to the rest of the world, is at a critical juncture where we must make concerted and dedicated efforts to drastically cut our carbon footprint immediately.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is at an inflection point. We either pursue old and tired methods of recovery that rely on slashing budgets and public sector jobs, or we chart a new direction that creates a new and sustainable economy while serving the dual purpose of addressing the climate crisis.</p>

<p>The choice is ours, and the chance to emerge from this historic challenge as better, cleaner, more resilient Pennsylvania is at our fingertips. Here&rsquo;s to hoping our elected officials are listening.</p>

A New Voice in the Fight Against Petrochemicals,7/16/2020,"<p>As the petrochemical industry rears its ugly head in Pennsylvania, PennFuture is building organizational capacity to deliver a counter narrative focused on the environment, health, and economic future of our state. I am joining PennFuture in this stead under the title of Policy Analyst.</p>

<p>I was first drawn into the fight against petrochemicals about three years ago while working in Pittsburgh at the Group Against Smog and Pollution (GASP) as a Communications and Education Specialist. I was doing outreach at an event in Pittsburgh, speaking to community members about Shell&rsquo;s petrochemical project in Beaver County&mdash;colloquially referred to as a &ldquo;cracker plant&rdquo;&mdash;when a community member recalled the sweet smell of cookies that once emanated from the Nabisco Plant in East Liberty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem so dangerous,&rdquo; he told me.</p>

<p>As I packed up my tabling materials later that day, his comment haunted me. How many other community members had misinterpreted the word &ldquo;cracker&rdquo;? Did they understand that Shell was hoping to cook up 1.6 million tons of plastic each year, not cookies? That the industry hoped to replicate Louisiana&rsquo;s toxic &ldquo;Cancer Alley&rdquo; right here in Pennsylvania? That each taxpayer had personally subsidized the buildout by an average of $397 worth of tax credits? What seemed like a small, innocent misunderstanding came to exemplify the true forces that we were up against: the industry&rsquo;s overwhelming presence in our political system, and their disquieting silence everywhere else.</p>

<p>These worries continued to plague me during my time with Pennsylvania Resources Council, where I worked as a Zero Waste Specialist to reduce waste through recycling and composting programs. I watched mountains of trash form over the course of just a few hours as I informed yet another resident that, no, their Starbucks cup was not recyclable, nor was their plastic lid or plastic straw. I came to understand that, despite what the petrochemical industry would have you believe, this problem was bigger than any individual, and our well-intentioned attempts at recycling were not going to solve it.</p>

<p>While my heart is in Pittsburgh and my eyes and ears are on Pennsylvania&rsquo;s petrochemical interests, I am currently writing to you from New Haven, Connecticut. I left Pittsburgh two years ago to attend the Yale School of the Environment. While here, I&rsquo;ve layered a deeper understanding of environmental justice on top of my growing expertise in communications, regional air quality issues, and policy analysis.</p>

<p>Environmental justice lies at the core of my value system, and all of my work is filtered through that lens. I bring these concerns&mdash;those of distributional impacts on economy, environment and health; generational impacts on our youth, of which I consider myself included; and procedural impacts resulting from unjust power relations between industry and individuals&mdash;to my role as Policy Analyst.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I am joining a committed team of staff members&mdash;PennFuture&rsquo;s DEIJ (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice) Committee&mdash;to help further environmental justice within the organization.</p>

<p>I have a Master&rsquo;s of Environmental Management from the Yale School of Forestry and a Bachelor&rsquo;s of Science in Environmental Science from the University of Florida. I also have an almost 3-year old brother, a less adorable 30-year old brother, and a lovely cast of family and friends supporting me in both South Florida and Pittsburgh. I hope to relocate to Pittsburgh as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a strange time to be making big life changes and yet, here I am, in the middle of the pandemic, joining PennFuture in a fight that will determine Pennsylvania&rsquo;s future&mdash;as well as the stability of our global climate and the long-term efficacy of the fossil fuel industry&mdash;for generations to come. There is no place I would rather be. So, to the board, my fellow co-workers, and anyone who supports PennFuture&rsquo;s work and mission: I am so grateful to have joined the team.</p>

<p>Together, let&rsquo;s chart a path for Pennsylvania that includes a clean energy economy and a healthy environment, not petrochemicals, plastics and dirty energy. </p>

Pipeline's Cancellation Shows Importance of Renewables in Pennsylvania,7/8/2020,"<p>In a major win for the environment, Dominion Energy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. announced Sunday that they will not be moving forward with their Atlantic Coast fracked gas pipeline. The <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/05/dominion-duke-cancel-atlantic-coast-pipeline-legal-uncertainty/5380949002/"">companies said increased costs and delays</a> as well as &ldquo;legal uncertainty&rdquo; made the project untenable. The pipeline&rsquo;s demise ends the threat it posed to the water, air, and soil of the communities through which it would have passed.</p>

<p>The pipeline was controversial from its inception in 2014. Environmentalists and local landowners opposed the 600-mile project, which would have crossed the Appalachian Trail and carried fracked gas from West Virginia to North Carolina. In its path was the predominantly African-American community of Union Hill, Virginia.</p>

<p>The Sierra Club, the Virginia State Conference of NAACP Branches, and the Kairos Center for Religions, Rights, and Social Justice, among others, joined a suit brought by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Friends of Buckingham to stop the pipeline&rsquo;s construction.</p>

<p>In January, a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously found that Virginia&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Quality <a href=""https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/pipeline-station.pdf"">had failed to adequately consider</a> the pipeline&rsquo;s potential effects on Union Hill citizens. The 4th Circuit also agreed that Virginia had failed to consider zero-emission turbines as an alternative to the pipeline developers&rsquo; use of gas-fired turbines in a compressor station.</p>

<p>For developers Duke and Dominion, that ruling was only the latest in a string of legal headaches: the pipeline&rsquo;s Endangered Species Act permit, right of way across the Blue Ridge Parkway, and water permit verifications <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060119601"">had all already been invalidated</a> by the 4th Circuit in 2018.</p>

<p>But last month, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-1584_igdj.pdf"">sided with the energy companies</a> and overturned another 4th Circuit decision that prevented the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from granting the pipeline a special use permit for a segment of pipeline that crossed the Appalachian National Scenic Trail on federal land.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the environment and the affected communities, the pipeline developers&rsquo; Supreme Court victory wasn&rsquo;t enough to justify moving forward on the project. The pipeline still lacked many other permits, and <a href=""https://www.southernenvironment.org/news-and-press/news-feed/atlantic-coast-pipeline-problems-persist-despite-supreme-court-decision"">evidence suggested that the project</a> would only add unnecessary fossil fuel capacity to the grid. Duke and Dominion <a href=""https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/dominion-energy-and-duke-energy-cancel-the-atlantic-coast-pipeline"">said in a statement</a> that ongoing &ldquo;litigation risk,&rdquo; including recent adverse rulings in other districts, made the project &ldquo;no longer a prudent use of shareholder capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like Virginia, Pennsylvania has witnessed rapid growth in its gas industry over the past decade because of fracking. The industry has long touted itself as both a jobs creator and an environmentally friendly alternative to coal-fired energy generation.</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s true that fracked gas has lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal, extraction through fracking <a href=""https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-other-important-greenhouse-gas"">also results in the leakage of methane</a>, a greenhouse gas with a <a href=""https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-other-important-greenhouse-gas"">heat-trapping potential 84 times higher</a> than that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. And recent research has concluded that methane emissions from oil and gas production have been underestimated <a href=""https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2020/02/19/Scientists-greatly-underestimating-methane-emitted-by-humans/6531582130062/"">by as much as 40 percent</a>. That means that fracked gas is little better than coal when it comes to slowing climate change and in fact, it may be worse.</p>

<p>In addition, fracking can <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/environmental-impacts-natural-gas#references"">result in the release of toxic and hazardous air pollutants</a> regulated by the EPA due to their ability to cause cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, and other health complications.</p>

<p>Finally, fracking can also <a href=""https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/issues/fracking/environmental-impacts-water/"">threaten local water resources</a>, especially in areas where water is already scarce. The toxic chemicals used in fracking fluid are stored in open pits that have been linked to animal deaths and negative health consequences in humans. And fracking liquid, flammable gas, or methane itself <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/article/federal-report-appears-to-undercut-epa-assurances-water-safety-pennsylvania"">often contaminates local water sources</a>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, in Pennsylvania, the Attorney General has been coming down hard not only on the industry but also the state Department of Environmental Protection for failing to operate safely (<a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/press-releases/ag-shapiro-pa-fracking-company-pleads-to-criminal-conviction-in-43rd-statewide-grand-jury-investigation/"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/press-releases/ag-shapiro-and-43rd-statewide-grand-jury-file-criminal-charges-against-nepa-fracking-company/"">here</a>) and for <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/press-releases/43rd-statewide-grand-jury-finds-pennsylvania-failed-to-protect-citizens-during-fracking-boom/"">failing to protect our communities</a> and our environment from the harmful impacts of fracking.</p>

Food &amp; Water Watch <a href=""https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/news/fracking-industrys-phony-jobs-numbers"">recently found that the American Petroleum Institute</a>, a leading oil and fracking trade group, &ldquo;promotes extremely misleading claims about the number of Americans working in the fracking industry&rdquo; in &ldquo;a clear attempt to defend the economically struggling industry that is linked to air, water, and climate pollution.&rdquo; API has claimed, for instance, that half a million jobs in Pennsylvania would be at risk if fracking were banned in the state. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, on the other hand, counts only 26,000 fracking jobs in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The industry has contracted significantly in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Even before the pandemic, North American fracking firms were in a precarious position: their <a href=""https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/CGEPReserveBaseLendingAndTheOutlookForShaleOilAndGasFinance.pdf"">net debt exploded</a> from $50 billion in 2005 to $200 billion in 2015. After the COVID-19 outbreak began, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/energy-environment/pennsylvania-shale-gas-fracking.html"">Chevron suggested it might sell </a>its Appalachian shale assets, the bulk of which are in Pennsylvania. And Chesapeake Energy<span id=""docs-internal-guid-91bed888-7fff-4e7b-ca45-a3c01629191f""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">&mdash;</span></span>once the second-largest fracked gas producer in the U.S. and a pioneer in the fracking boom<span id=""docs-internal-guid-91bed888-7fff-4e7b-ca45-a3c01629191f""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">&mdash;</span></span><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/28/business/chesapeake-energy-bankruptcy/index.html"">filed for bankruptcy last month</a>.</p>

<p>The better option for Pennsylvania is to invest in clean, renewable energy. Unlike fracked gas and other fossil fuels, solar and wind power are not subject to the same sorts of supply and production issues that lead to volatile market fluctuations. As a result, <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/benefits-renewable-energy-use"">renewable energy prices can remain stable</a> over time. This is good news for consumers, who can then depend upon predictable electricity costs.</p>

<p>In addition, jobs in solar and wind are growing, while jobs in the fossil fuel industry are not. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that over the next decade, <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm"">the two fastest-growing jobs</a> in the U.S. are solar photovoltaic installer and wind turbine service technician. As far back as 2016, the solar power industry alone employed <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/for-us-jobs-creation-renewables-are-a-better-bet-than-coal"">twice as many people</a> as the coal, oil, and gas industries combined did.</p>

<p>And finally, the pure economics of renewables make them the obvious choice for developing new generating capacity. Solar and wind energy generation <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/04/climate-change-coal-now-more-expensive-than-wind-solar-energy/1277637001/"">are already competitive with fracked gas</a> in many parts of the country. This math is the primary reason <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/business/energy-environment/coronavirus-oil-wind-solar-energy.html"">why the use of renewables has grown</a> despite the Trump administration&rsquo;s tariffs on solar cells and panels, and its withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania needs <a href=""/clean-energy"">more clean energy jobs</a><span id=""docs-internal-guid-91bed888-7fff-4e7b-ca45-a3c01629191f""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">&mdash;</span></span>jobs that support Pennsylvania&rsquo;s communities and safeguard its wildlife and natural resources. What&rsquo;s more, the only major impediment to a total transition toward renewables has been largely attenuated by better and more affordable utility-scale storage options.</p>

"PennFuture Joins Forces with Businesses and Community Members to Launch the ""Pledge to Defend Our Pocono Waters"" Campaign",7/6/2020,"<p>Recreation areas across Pennsylvania are experiencing unprecedented number of visitors. When I first left my house following quarantine, I felt like a trout fry emerging from the gravel. I was so eager to follow the sunlight, stretch my fins and find some escape from anxieties of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>Observers note that by June the condition of many trails appeared as though they already received as much foot traffic as usually experienced by the end of the summer season. As restrictions are lifted, outfitters are experiencing a flood of interest for water-based activities.</p>

<p>Across Pennsylvania our outdoor spaces are so important for the health of our residents, the social fabric of our communities and the economic vitality of our small businesses and commercial corridors. This is especially true when considering the role of clean waters to the Poconos Mountain region.</p>

<p>To help ensure local leaders recognize the importance of Exceptional Value streams during this time of economic recovery, PennFuture is participating in a new campaign led by <a href=""http://www.ourpoconowaters.org/"">Our Pocono Waters</a>.<br />
A partnership of businesses, clean water advocates and outdoor recreation enthusiasts, Our Pocono Waters is launching a new pledge campaign to demonstrate the broad base of support for clean water protections. <a href=""https://youtu.be/wT2Cb0CtMzM"">Check out the ad airing this summer</a> on WNEP, the most watched station in Northeastern Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Partners who have stepped up to pledge to defend the region&rsquo;s waterways include outfitters, breweries and other small business leaders, as well as fishing, conservation and environmental groups.<br />
If you find yourself valuing clean waters and outdoor recreation now more than ever, please consider joining the pledge campaign. Pledge to defend stream protections. Then share how you and your family enjoy the clean waters of the Pocono Mountains region. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/ourpoconowaters/index.html"">Pledge to defend Our Pocono Waters</a>.</p>

<p>While only 2 percentof Pennsylvania streams are Exceptional Value &mdash; the classification granted to the cleanest streams with highest quality of water &mdash; <a href=""/Files/Admin/EV-one-pager-FINAL-7.26.18.pdf"">80 percentare located in the Poconos Mountain region</a>, primarily within Monroe, Pike and Wayne counties. These include many headwaters to the upper and middle sections of the Delaware River. Exceptional Value streams support some of the country&rsquo;s premiere wild trout populations, offering recreational benefits, natural beauty and other important ecosystem services.</p>

<p>Outdoor recreation and other tourism activities continue to drive the economy of the Pocono Mountains region. Exceptional Value streams are at the heart of what makes the region such a tourism destination.</p>

<p>The Our Pocono Waters campaign has previously called on local officials to publicly support the ability for the PA Department of Environmental Protection and Environmental Quality Board to safeguard Pocono streams through appropriate Exceptional Value designations. The 2018 campaign collected more than 3,300 petition signatures from across the Poconos community.</p>

<p>This time around, Our Pocono Waters is featuring voices of the community who most stand to benefit from continued Exceptional Value protections. <a href=""https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCWXXvnYjfkMH4sj2H2u0IVQ/videos/upload?filter=%5B%5D&amp;sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D"">Watch some of the videos</a> we received so far.</p>

PennFuture Secures Two Legal Victories in One Week,7/1/2020,"<p>At PennFuture, we take great pride in being Pennsylvania&rsquo;s watchdog for clean air, pure water and a healthy environment. We approach our work through multiple facets, one of which involves flexing our legal muscle and protecting our environment through litigation in local, state and federal courts.</p>

<p>Over the course of our 22-year history, PennFuture has achieved significant and meaningful legal victories and, just this week, we received word that two cases had been resolved in our favor.</p>

<p>The first victory, <a href=""https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/AlleghenyDefenseProjectetalvFERCDocketNo1701098DCCirMar232017Cour/5?1593554996"">handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit</a>, involved the use of so-called &ldquo;tolling orders&rdquo; by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Tolling orders allow an agency or court to pause or delay the running of time to take action that is set forth in a statute. Put simply, for many years FERC used these tolling orders to indefinitely delay reviewing complaints from property owners who wished to protect their property from fracked gas and pipeline development.</p>

<p>In fact, FERC used tolling orders in 99 percent of the cases between 2009 and 2017 in which property owners, organizations, and other aggrieved parties asked for rehearings of FERC decisions involving pipeline projects. Until the rehearing request was finally decided upon, the parties were prevented from challenging FERC&rsquo;s decision in court.</p>

<p>Most concerningly, even as these parties were blocked from having their day in court, pipeline companies could rely on the decisions to condemn private property and begin construction, resulting in irreparable harm to property and the environment.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the D.C. Circuit on Tuesday ruled that FERC cannot indefinitely delay the review of these complaints. This decision gives landowners, environmental groups, and environmental justice communities who are disproportionately burdened by pipeline infrastructure back our right to challenge FERC&rsquo;s decisions before the irreparable harm from pipeline construction can occur.</p>

<p>PennFuture, which was represented by EarthJustice in this case, was just one of several entities that submitted an amici curiae (&ldquo;friend of the court&rdquo;) brief in the case challenging the illegal use of these tolling order , and we are thankful for the court&rsquo;s ruling. To read more about this case, <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2020/06/federal-appeals-court-stops-fercs.html"">click here</a>.</p>

<p>The second legal victory, <a href=""https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/01_Enviro_Complaint_04-15-2019.pdf"">handed down by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California</a>, involved a case where PennFuture and other organizations, again represented by EarthJustice, sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to properly regulate coke ovens like those found at U.S. Steel&rsquo;s plant outside of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>In 2005, the EPA publicly acknowledged that carcinogenic emissions from coke ovens destroy air quality and cause devastating health complications, yet the agency also admitted it wasn&rsquo;t sure that its regulations were protecting communities located near these coke plants.</p>

<p>No new rules or regulations have come forth from the EPA in the 15 years since that admission, and this lawsuit demanded that EPA finally take action and craft regulations that protect citizens who live near these dangerous plants. In response to our lawsuit, EPA conceded liability and admitted that they had failed to establish three of the necessary standards to protect human health and the environment as alleged in our lawsuit. The court set a 30-month deadline for the EPA to act on these rules, which is a significant victory for public health.</p>

<p>Both of these court decisions are significant victories for citizens across America whose rights to clean air and clean water have been denied for far too long. These decisions are also further evidence that PennFuture will not stand idly by as corporate polluters and our federal government trample on our rights solely in the name of profits.</p>

PennFuture’s Legal Internship Program Helps to Train and Inspire the Next Generation of Environmental Lawyers in Pennsylvania,6/30/2020,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past 20 years, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognized that we need to be more involved with cultivating the legal talent that will continue to support our mission. Our attorneys have a long history of mentoring legal interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.</p>

<p>This year, with the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haus Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor law students interested in making a difference for our environment.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting the State as well as to further their potential careers in environmental law.</p>

<p>Speaking from personal experience, the ability of law students to have meaningful legal internships at non-profit organizations is often compromised by the need to financially support oneself while attending law school. We hope that over the coming years, our ability to provide a paid legal internship opportunity will allow for a greater diversity of students and flexibility to be a part of PennFuture and the non-profit environmental law community in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This summer, we have a fantastic group of law students for our inaugural internship class, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We&rsquo;ve asked our summer legal interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</p>

<p><strong>Megan Rulli, a rising second-year law student at Penn State Dickinson School of Law. Ms. Rulli is workingon a variety of legal matters impacting our water resources across the state.</strong></p>

<p>I come to environmental law after a decade in the world of small-scale, sustainable agriculture. I&rsquo;ve switched to a career in law in order to understand and shape environmental policy.PennFuture is an organization that is working on many levels to make the change I believe necessary to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment for future generations.I feel lucky to be part of a group of people that organizes communities at the grass roots level, works with decision makers to implement meaningful environmental policy, and makes strategic legal challenges that protect the earth and result in long term change.</p>

<p>I first became interested in law as an environmental activist in college, where I saw the power of law as a tool for change. While as students we held meetings and dreamed of change, lawyers were able to enter rooms with decision makers and get things done.I hope to do the same in my legal career.This summer I have the pleasure of seeing the legal standards that protect the environment in action and of participating in campaigns that ensure those standards have teeth.Like farming, law is both challenging and rewarding, and I am excited to take my first steps in this field with PennFuture.</p>

<p><strong>Timothy Wolff, a rising third-year law evening student at the University of Maryland, Francis King Carey School of Law. Mr. Wolff is working with Rob Altenburg on energy and climate issues, including PA&rsquo;s Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) plan.</strong></p>

<p>I grew up on a rural Columbia County dairy farm. Tucked among the states rolling hills and close to natural treasures like Ricketts Glen State Park, I developed a deep appreciation for the areas scenic beauty.After college, I spent several years working for a renewable energy company in Lebanon County.Our work not only added badly-needed jobs to the region and produced environmental benefits, but strengthened the balance sheets of our customers farms and rural small businesses.</p>

<p>I care about environmental issues because having a world that can continually provide food, housing, and resources in the quantities necessary to sustain our communities while population continues to climb is huge challenge that affects everyone.Invention and transformation are hallmarks of the American economy, and I feel that there is a great deal of opportunity to both move us towards a sustainable path while promoting economic prosperity.</p>

<p><strong>Richard Marcil, a rising third-year law student at Widener Law School. Mr. Marcil is working with both me and Rob on matters ranging from developing the federal policy initiative for the Reimagine Appalachia collaboration to researching energy and climate issues for our Energy Center.</strong></p>

<p>Everyone has a right to clean air, water, and soil. Environmental law is the toolbox with which we protect these rights. But environmental law does more than just safeguard human health and wellness. It also protects animals, their habitats, and ecosystems. It ensures we can grow healthy food in a sustainable manner. And it helps us secure economic prosperity. At a time when climate change is accelerating and federal regulators are rolling back environmental rules and enforcement efforts, the work PennFuture is doing to fight for these rights and benefits is more vital now than ever.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team is dedicated to restoring and protecting our environment and communities, to protecting our right to clean air and pure water, and to moving Pennsylvania toward a clean energy future. I thank our amazing staff and legal interns for their great work, and also our members for your continued support. We can&rsquo;t do this without you!</p>

At the Bottom of a Steep Learning Curve,6/19/2020,"<p>Since the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police in late May, we have witnessed an ignition of individual, communal and global action against racism, injustice and inequality.</p>

<p>People are mobilized in anger and in peace, hearts and minds are active and anguished, and consciences are toiling. Aligned institutions, organizations and businesses are grappling with responsibility, and endeavoring to respond and support.</p>

<p>And so it is at PennFuture. My thinking about what the diversity work implanted throughout our 2019 strategic plan would look like has been thoroughly upended.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s overly simplistic to say that I anticipated a great deal of our effort would play out the way it has been described in trainings we&rsquo;ve been exposed to&mdash;fairly prescriptive pathways and a lot of checking of boxes. I had anticipated that organizational culture would need to be explored, and assessed, and eventually transformed.</p>

<p>But I did not grasp, until now, and because of now, the extent to which the work must begin with conversations about racism, bigotry and hatred. These conversations have always been part of the diversity curriculumbut now stand at the front of a long line of issues we must work our way through in an aspiration to be an inclusive, diverse, fair and just organization.</p>

<p>I knew a path to diversity would be painful and difficult, but I thought it might be a collective pain and discomfort, and now am figuring out the discomfort will be felt personally and deeply. But it will never be commensurate to the pain and hurt America has laid on communities of color since the birth of this country and right up to today.</p>

<p>Over the last weeks, the PennFuture staff that I work with has responded so admirably, and with so much bravery and leadership. The environmental community wants to be a leader in helping solve racism and prejudice, but do we really have a clue to how that can happen?</p>

<p>I believe we do, and I believe that knowledge at PennFuture resides with our younger and newer staff members who bring diversity and fresh ideas to the table, but also deeply personal experiences that have shaped their worldviews and perspectives.</p>

<p>These individuals have stood up with a generosity of spirit, with clear words and thoughts and with an insistence that they be heard within the organization. They are pushing our organization forward. They have expectations and desires for the future and realize we are in a moment when the time to assert them is ripe.</p>

<p>This team wants our organization to be an ally to the marginalized people of our state, to find new partners, to understand from them how we can use our privilege and access and resources and yes, expertise, in service to these impacted communities and the issues they prioritize. Will it always be possible for us to help? Probably not, but we must figure out some mechanisms and programs to contribute.</p>

<p>On Monday, June 1, after the first weekend of justice actions took place throughout the state, PennFuture <a href=""/News-PennFuture-issues-statement-in-reaction-to-recent-events"">offered a brief statement of solidarity</a> for the justice activists and their calls for change.Since the next day, June 2, was Election Day, we included our hopes that everyone who is eligible to vote is registered to vote, and voting regularly as one pathway to that change. In fact, that is one goal of PennFuture&rsquo;s new Democracy for All program, which reaches out to communities of color and provides civic engagement opportunities.</p>

<p>We grasp that the same dynamics of power that have perpetuated racism also have systematically manipulated the people&rsquo;s ability to engage with, and have faith in, our elections and civic opportunities.But I hope we do not give up on our democracy or the American flag as a symbol of our dreams and vision for the future.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve shared some early thoughts here but to say more would immediately put me back in a place where I think I know something I really don&rsquo;t, which is what the road to diversity will look like for PennFuture.</p>

<p>I will have contributions to make to that future, along with many others here. It is within my ability and control to say with certainty the matter will not be relegated to the back burner.</p>

"Fracked Gas, Petrochemical Industries Continue to Overpromise and Underdeliver for Pennsylvanians",6/18/2020,"<p>A core tenant of our mission at PennFuture is working to secure a better and brighter future for all Pennsylvanians, and a large part of that mission is protecting our basic rights to clean air and pure water.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a significant threat to those rights has emerged in the form of the fracked gas and petrochemical industries, which are trying to further entrench and intertwine themselves into our political landscape and economy.</p>

<p>The industries attempt to woo our small and mid-sized communities with promises of revitalization and economic prosperity, all while promising to be stringent and responsible protectors of our shared environment and natural resources.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re lying. These claims aren&rsquo;t hard to debunk: in the last week alone, four news stories have been published that expose the financial realities of fracked gas and petrochemicals, as well as those industries&rsquo; complete disregard for the health of Pennsylvanians and our environment.</p>

<p>The first story concerns a group of economists, engineers, policy analysts and former policymakers who banded together <a href=""https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200615/cracker-plant-wonrsquot-bring-petrochemical-jobs-boom-to-ohio-experts-warn"">to issue a letter to the governors of Pennsylvania</a>, Ohio, and West Virginia , stressing that a reliance on petrochemicals for prosperity is both dangerous and badly misguided.</p>

<p>The authors&mdash;among them prominent officials like former Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Secretary John Hanger, Executive Director of West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy Ted Boettner, and Carnegie Mellon University Associate Professor of Economics Nicholas Z. Muller&mdash;told the governors that they &ldquo;risk squandering hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds in pursuit of a vision that will not materialize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That vision won&rsquo;t materialize largely because it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly unprofitable. Market conditions are extremely unfavorable as the price of plastic is plummeting, combined with an oversaturation of fracked gas and petrochemical plants that are far outpacing demand.</p>

<p>Simply put, the dream of an Appalachian petrochemical hub is dissipating quickly, but some of our elected officials and policymakers are hesitant to let go and pursue more viable strategies and sound economic development policies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for residents in Beaver County, the decision to cater to the petrochemical industry has already been made, and another report issued last week is showing the folly of that decision.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://insideclimatenews.org/news/03062020/shell-plastics-plant-pittsburgh-coronavirus"">Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns</a> that Shell&rsquo;s massive plastics factory on the banks of the Ohio River won&rsquo;t be nearly as profitable as once thought due to a combination of poor market conditions and the fact that Shell will be making fewer plastics because of global oversupply.</p>

<p>That all spells bad news for a community that was previously decimated by the collapse of the domestic steel industry, and a community that took Shell at its word when the company promised prosperity and economic revitalization.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that a less profitable plastics plant means fewer jobs and far less impact on the local and regional economy. It is also further proof that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s lawmakers in 2012 shouldn&rsquo;t have offered a massive $1.6 billion tax break to lure Shell to Pennsylvania in the first place.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that these industries are not delivering on promises made to Pennsylvanians, but it&rsquo;s even worse that they are also destroying our environment and natural resources in the process.</p>

<p>To that end, Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced on Friday that his office <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/post/range-resources-pleads-no-contest-environmental-crimes-southwest-pa-well-sites#stream/0"">had secured a criminal conviction against Range Resources</a>, one of the largest fracking companies operating in Pennsylvania, for environmental crimes at two separate sites in Washington County.</p>

<p>Specifically, Range Resources pleaded no contest to several environmental crimes after a two-year investigation found the company so heavily polluted a family&rsquo;s drinking water supply that it was rendered &ldquo;dangerous and unsuitable for consumption.&rdquo; In a separate incident, the company so heavily polluted a field in Washington County that 100 trees and 12,000 square feet of soil had to be removed.</p>

<p>As if those environmental crimes aren&rsquo;t enough, the attorney general proved that the company knowingly covered up issues that ultimately led to the contamination of the drinking water supply.</p>

<p>Finally, the attorney general on Monday <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/press-releases/ag-shapiro-and-43rd-statewide-grand-jury-file-criminal-charges-against-nepa-fracking-company/"">announced similar environmental crimes</a> against Cabot Oil and Gas after the company contaminated well water in Dimock, Susquehanna County. In one instance, a landowner held a match to a jug that contained water used for drinking and bathing, and the water caught fire.</p>

<p>Water set ablaze. More than 100 trees permanently removed. A family&rsquo;s drinking supply permanently contaminated. These are very real and very serious incidents, but they are far from the only incidents.</p>

<p>Is the promise of jobs worth the environmental degradation and sickness that accompanies them? Should our elected leaders continue to believe these companies when they promise a better and brighter future?</p>

<p>Keep in mind, these industries beg for and often receive enormous subsidies and tax breaks from our elected officials, and still continue to fail financially even as taxpayers foot the bill. They consistently and purposefully overpromise and underdeliver, then pack up and leave our communities in far worse shape after extracting our resources and destroying our environment.</p>

<p>Time and again we&rsquo;ve been shown the true nature of these industries, both financially and environmentally. It&rsquo;s time we start listening.</p>

COVID-19: A Green Recovery,6/15/2020,"<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-21bf8d08-7fff-9b50-5f6b-5162a431595c""></span><span id=""docs-internal-guid-345b33da-7fff-3ff3-c549-2be1a63ccc52""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""></span></span></p>

<p>Amidst the impacts of the COVID-19 public health crisis, we have seen a significant decline in emissions of air pollution both nationally and in Pennsylvania. As our communities begin the journey to recovery, and emissions rise, we have a duty and an opportunity to protect Pennsylvanians&mdash;especially those that are substantially more vulnerable to COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.</p>

<p>There is no silver bullet to address air pollution. In Pennsylvania, one possible path is a three-pronged approach that includes modernizing and extending our antiquated Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS), strengthening our Act 129 energy efficiency law, and joining our neighbors throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) currently being considered in Harrisburg. With these changes, we can finally begin to bring our energy economy into the 21st century.</p>

<p>A report by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers <a href=""https://www.yorkdispatch.com/story/news/local/2020/02/13/pa-leads-nation-premature-deaths-due-air-pollution-study-finds/4749624002/"">published in February concluded that Pennsylvania</a> leads the lower 48 in premature death rate per capita from air pollution. We paid for this nefarious designation with 4,800 preventable deaths in 2018.While the study recognized cross-border air pollution impacts, it found that Pennsylvanians are largely doing this to ourselves.</p>

<p>As tragic as this is, this year may be worse&mdash;a Harvard study <a href=""https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/air-pollution-linked-with-higher-covid-19-death-rates/"">recently found that exposure to air pollution</a>, particularly small particulate matter (2.5) dramatically increased the likelihood that those infected with COVID-19 would die.</p>

<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/"">projects an 11 percent decline</a> in energy-related CO2 emissions this year due to stay-at-home orders across the nation. However, that is not a sustainable reduction and emissions are expected to jump 5 percent once we fully reopen.After the Great Recession in 2009, the benefits gained from temporary emission reductions began to quickly evaporate.Nationally, emissions from the energy sector <a href=""https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/"">declined by 7.2 percent in 2009</a> only to rebound by 3.6 percent the following year.</p>

<p>Those numbers were even larger in Pennsylvania&mdash;we experienced <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/analysis/pdf/table1.pdf"">a massive 9.4 percent reduction</a> but then a 4.9 percent rise in 2010. Our sluggish economy played a role in the 2009 &ndash; 2010 net reduction, yet the dramatic shift towards less-carbon-intensive energy sources was due primarily to the federal American Recovery &amp; Reinvestment Act and the state Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.pennaeps.com/"">Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act of 2004</a> requires that by 2021, 8 percent of electricity consumed in Pennsylvania originate from &rdquo;Tier 1&rdquo; renewable sources, with one-half of one percent of that coming from solar power, and 10 percent from &ldquo;Tier 2&rdquo; sources, which sadly includes electric generation from dirty waste coal and other non-renewable sources. Once an aggressive standard 15 years ago, Harrisburg has allowed Pennsylvania to fall woefully behind as our neighbors in Maryland, New Jersey, and New York:<span id=""docs-internal-guid-7ffb90da-7fff-5aed-0fd1-9d99a6c035c5""></span></p>

<p>Our neighbors have outworked us to become leaders in the clean energy revolution. Significantly, our AEPS requirement plateaus after 2021&mdash;stifling the Commonwealth&rsquo;s momentum of success. Even <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-virginia-renewables/virginia-passes-bill-to-achieve-100-carbon-free-power-by-2045-idUSKBN20T2OF"">Virginia recently committed itself in March</a> to be 100 percent carbon free by 2045. All the while we Pennsylvanians have seen other states with less land and less natural potential for renewables zoom past us.</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2010/geo/state-area.html"">Pennsylvania has 6 times more land</a> and receives <a href=""https://neo.ne.gov/programs/stats/pdf/201_solar_leadership.pdf"">more solar radiance</a> than New Jersey, yet the Garden State <a href=""https://www.seia.org/states-map"">has 3,180 MW of installed solar PV</a> versus 491 MW in Pennsylvania. It is time for the General Assembly to once again spur renewable development and put Pennsylvania on equal footing with our neighbors.</p>

<p>Compounding the issue of our outdated AEPS is the imminent catastrophe heading our way as federal tax credits for renewables will be eliminated, or dramatically reduced, over the next 18 months. The fossil fuel industry <a href=""https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/policy-digests/ending-fossil-fuel-tax-subsidies"">benefits from tax breaks permanently</a> written into the tax code, yet credits for renewables are provided for only a few years, if that long.Two renewable energy sub-sectors are at the top of the expected job growth list over the next decade (keep reading) according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Why should we build roadblocks to progress?</p>

<p>Regarding energy efficiency measures, the Commonwealth <a href=""http://www.puc.state.pa.us/filing_resources/issues_laws_regulations/act_129_information.aspx"">implemented Act 129 in 2008</a>.This enactment created the Energy Efficiency &amp; Conservation (EE&amp;C) Program that has spurred utility rebates for purchasing energy efficient goods.Since its implementation, Act 129 <a href=""https://www.aceee.org/white-paper/lifting-the-cap-040419"">has generated over $6.4 billion in net consumer benefits</a> through the deployment of efficiency measures throughout Pennsylvania. In fact, the program requires not only that targets be cost-effective, but also makes that determination with a very restrictive test that does not even consider health and environmental benefits.</p>

<p>While this program <a href=""https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pa-jobs-040419.pdf"">achieved a modest 0.8 percent annual decline</a> in energy consumption across the state, just as with the AEPS, Harrisburg has failed to keep pace with our neighbors leading the charge.New Jersey (1.5 percent), New York (2 percent), and Maryland (2 percent) have all realizedthe benefits their states recognize with more aggressive efficiency standards.</p>

<p>Expanding the EE&amp;C Program is perhaps the lowest hanging fruit in Pennsylvania to reduce emissions.The program <a href=""http://www.puc.pa.gov/pcdocs/1656474.pdf"">could easily be doubled or tripled</a> at no net cost to ratepayers. Unfortunately, the program contains an arbitrary investment cap that is prohibiting the Commonwealth and its ratepayers from capturing the full potential of Act 129.The success stories of our neighboring states demonstrates what we are capable of if we get serious about energy efficiency.</p>

<p>On the horizon is <a href=""https://www.rggi.org/"">the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a>, a cooperative effort of 11 Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states that establishes an annual CO2 emissions limit for most power plants and the cap decreases annually by 2.5 percent. Governor Wolf <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/executive-order-2019-07-commonwealth-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change-through-electric-sector-emissions-reductions/"">has issued an Executive Order</a> directing the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to craft draft regulations under the authority granted by the General Assembly in the Air Pollution Control Act (APCA).</p>

<p>The initiative provides a market-based solution allowing for pollution credits to be sold, ensuring that CO2 reductions occur from the most cost-effective sources and providing long-term market certainty to stimulate renewable energy deployment.Because the U.S. Congress has been unable to advance a RGGI-like proposal at the national level, states grew tired of waiting on Washington and instead took action to protect their citizens and modernize their economies and energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Proceeds from the credits would be reinvested through Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Clean Air Fund to further reduce air pollution by deploying energy efficiency and renewable energy, among other things. These investments have a significant multiplier effect, rippling through the states&rsquo; economies.</p>

<p>In 2017, <a href=""https://www.rggi.org/sites/default/files/Uploads/Proceeds/RGGI_Proceeds_Report_2017.pdf"">RGGI states invested $315 million</a> from the sale of pollution allowances that abated 8,300,000 tons of CO2 emissions by avoiding a whopping 13.9 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, or the <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/units-and-calculators/"">equivalent of over 187,885,000 gallons</a> of gasoline.CO2 emissions from RGGI states have been reduced by 50 percent since 2005, not to mention the reductions of mercury, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter.All of this has taken place as the gross domestic product (GDP) of RGGI states continues to grow faster than the national average.</p>

<p>The size of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s generation sector is comparable to those plants that currently fall under the RGGI umbrella, so it is reasonable to conclude that similar benefits are likely.In 2022, the Commonwealth <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Air/AirQuality/AQPortalFiles/Advisory%20Committees/Air%20Quality%20Technical%20Advisory%20Committee/2020/5-7-20/AQTAC%20PA%20CO2%20Budget%20Trading%20Program.pdf"">has proposed limiting CO2 emissions</a> to 78 million tons, roughly equal to the 74 million ton adjusted limit for the combined RGGI states this year.In Pennsylvania the program is expected to generate $320 million in 2022 that will be reinveste",,
Pennsylvania’s House Environmental Committee Approves Bill Removing DEP’s Authority to Enact Carbon Reduction Program,6/9/2020,"<p>On June 9, the House Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committee, chaired by Representative Daryl Metcalfe (Butler), met to consider House Bill 2025 (Struzzi). Instead of passing critical climate legislation that would curb Pennsylvania&rsquo;s carbon emission pollution and combat the air quality challenges of our Commonwealth, Metcalfe&rsquo;s committee approved legislation that would usurp authority from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to enact a carbon reduction program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).</p>

<p>PennFuture is adamantly opposed to HB 2025 and frustrated with the legislators who voted to advance the bill to the full House floor for consideration.</p>

<p>Despite being in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and battling an illness that aggressively attacks the respiratory system, the House Environmental Committee saw it necessary to spend time today in the People&rsquo;s House peddling mistruths and conflating serious environmental policy with a suite of fables about &ldquo;Tinkerbell outfits and unicorns,&rdquo; communism, troubling disdain for &ldquo;Dictator Wolf&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Chinese virus,&rdquo; and vegetable gardening techniques. Following what has become a pattern for this Committee, today&rsquo;s proceedings were absurd, dangerous and far afield of the behavior of credible elected officials.</p>

<p>The truth is that Governor Tom Wolf&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/executive-order-2019-07-commonwealth-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change-through-electric-sector-emissions-reductions/"">Executive Order 2019-07</a> instructed the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to <a href=""/Blog-Item-Model-shows-RGGI-would-reduce-pollution-by-180-million-tons"">develop a cap-and-invest program</a> to control carbon pollution from power plants in Pennsylvania that aligns with the RGGI. And that&rsquo;s exactly what the current rule package does. Instead of letting power plants dump carbon pollution into our air for free, they will have to pay a price that is determined through an auction. In addition, millions of dollars in proceeds from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s participation in RGGI could and should be reinvested in our communities via air quality projects.</p>

<p>The truth is that joining RGGI would allow Pennsylvania to make crucial dents in its carbon pollution while simultaneously raising millions of dollars in the process. RGGI states <a href=""https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/01/power-plant-emissions-down-47-percent-under-the-regional-greenhouse-gas-initiative/"">have reduced their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 47 percent</a>, outpacing the rest of the nation by 90 percent. Scientists and economists <a href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/what-economists-say-about-carbon-pricing/"">both agree that carbon pricing</a> is one of the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Further, reducing air pollution would save hundreds of lives, tens of thousands of hours of lost work, lead to strong net job creation, and result in an overall total of $5.7 billion dollars in benefits.</p>

<p>Utilizing the &ldquo;polluter-pays&rdquo; principle is a meaningful way of combating this pollution. Rather than subsidizing the cost of pollution for dirty plants, we would monetize the costs of that pollution and let the market make better-informed choices about what power to buy. The ten RGGI states <a href=""https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">have seen $1.4 billion in net economic benefits</a> from 2015 to 2017. By linking Pennsylvania&rsquo;s air quality program with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Commonwealth could bring in as much as $350-500 million annually.</p>

<p>It was made clear today by Chairman Metcalfe&rsquo;s own revelation that attacking RGGI is nothing more than another attempt to undermine Governor Wolf. In his own words, Metcalfe said that &ldquo;impeachment is the only way to stop him.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s increasingly evident that this is a part of a grander scheme, and one that has shown for a long time to be anti-science and anti-reason.These games convey that the House leadership is not interested in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s&rsquo; clean air and financial growth, but instead solely focused on protecting their polluter friends.</p>

<p>Thankfully, environmental champions on the House Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committee stood up and put facts on record in the committee room, which is shuttered to the public.</p>

<p>Rep. Leanne Krueger (Delaware) rightfully made the case that the &ldquo;power for the Governor to join compacts [for Pennsylvania] is clearly in the Constitution,&rdquo; and argued that, &ldquo;we have a constitutional [duty] to protect clean air and pure water for all Pennsylvanians.&rdquo; Minority Chairman Greg Vitali (Delaware) added that, &ldquo;Pennsylvania clearly has authority to regulate carbon based on the [state&rsquo;s] Air Quality Control Act.&rdquo; Rep. Mary Isaacson (Philadelphia) showed that transitions and reinvestment in our communities is essential and that jobs spurred by Pennsylvania joining RGGI could be a great source of family-sustaining jobs for our workers.</p>

<p>Perhaps most compelling were the arguments put forward passionately by Rep. Danielle Friel Otten (Chester) who said that &ldquo;protecting our environment is truly about protecting the health and safety of Pennsylvanians.&rdquo; She mentioned that the leading cause of congenital heart disease and asthma in children is air pollution. Rep. Otten mentioned that joining RGGI has many benefits and that &ldquo;we can use money from RGGI to reinvest in environmental justice communities and communities of color who are disproportionately impacted by the industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We wholly agree, and at the end of the day, as Rep. Otten succinctly and powerfully posited, &ldquo;when we&rsquo;re not protecting our children, seniors, and vulnerable populations, we&rsquo;re not upholding our constitutional duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PennFuture will continue to oppose this cavalier legislation and its companion bill in the Senate&mdash;SB 950 (Pittman)&mdash;and will continue to advocate for the advancement of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s RGGI rulemaking package, which will bring about significant reduction to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s carbon pollution along with increased economic benefits.</p>

Looking in the Rearview Mirror,6/8/2020,"<p>In all honesty, by 1994 after six years leading two environmental movements&mdash;the PA Rainforest Action Committee and Central PA Earth Day Committee&mdash;I became disillusioned that the 20th anniversary of Earth Day would reigniteaction from Washington to address the threat of global warming, as it was referred to then. For the next 10 years my activism took the form of writing, publishing and studying this country&rsquo;s history of environmental irresponsibility.</p>

<p>In 2004, John Hanger&mdash;the first Executive Director of PennFuture&mdash;asked me to join the Board of Directors of the organization. At the time, their motto was &ldquo;Every environmental victory is an economic success.&rdquo; Bingo! I found my tribe.</p>

<p>PennFuture has always, even from inception, been highly respected within Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental community. Where it had tremendous impact was in the halls of the Capitol. Those were &lsquo;good times&rsquo; for the environment.</p>

<p>We had the ear of Governor Ed Rendell, who had faith in Hanger and PennFuture. There was more balance in the legislature. DEP and DCNR were doing good work and our Energy Center was busy paving inroads for alternatives and throughout those years, our funding from Heinz and Pew Foundations remained strong. In sum, the staff of PennFuture were laying the foundation of what would become a distinguished environmental organization in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>By 2008 we were celebrating our 10th anniversary with Vice President Al Gore in attendance to support us. Mr. Gore describe PennFuture as &ldquo;the only statewide environmental organization in the country with a three-tier focus of policy, legal and energy work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were riding high on successes until the chessboard pieces shifted. Hanger moved onto head DEP, Gov. Tom Corbett replaced Rendell, and the Marcellus Shale created new environmental challenges while gaining more influence on policy.</p>

<p>At the same time, PennFuture was going through what seemed like a revolving door of leadership. In hindsight, these were the most challenging years for the board. I give credit to the leadership of Chair David Lane for guiding the organization through several years of executive searches. For both the staff and the board members, it was our commitment to PennFuture&rsquo;s mission as &ldquo;the watchdogs of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment&rdquo; that we refreshed our efforts.</p>

<p>By 2014, I moved into the Chair&rsquo;s shoes and we were again searching for an Executive Director. In 2015 PennFuture was fortunate to hire Larry Schweiger who had recently stepped down from the National Wildlife Federation. To be frank, we felt we hit payday. And it turns out we did.</p>

<p>Larry brought new ideas and opened doors for the organization. It was Larry&rsquo;s leadership that began the conversation to partner with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, which has strengthened our policy and advocacy work and expanded PennFuture&rsquo;s influence.</p>

<p>Larry insisted he hire Jacquelyn Bonomo as his chief operating officer. Jacqui came with decades of environmental leadership and discipline, and she brought structure to the organization and always had an ear for my input, which made working with her one of the highlights of my tenure.</p>

<p>When Jacqui became President/CEO in 2017 and hired Matt Stepp as chief operating officer, they began restructuring PennFuture to meet the political, environmental, financial and personnel challenges of the time. This was hard work that required serious communication, organization and action. Throughout, the board was there to guide and support this transition.</p>

<p>During my time with PennFuture, I have witnessed the organization being transformed into a highly organized, focused and impressive instrument for change. Our reach throughout Pennsylvania has expanded beyond anything I could have imagined 16 years ago when I joined the board.</p>

<p>I leave PF confident and grateful. Confident that the executives are clear, dedicated and driven leaders. Grateful that climate change is now a main focus of PennFuture and grateful for my fellow board members who have always taken their position seriously and when needed, rolled up their sleeves, put in the time and got the work done with the understanding they are the caretakers of this important organization.</p>

<p><u><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Though she wouldn&rsquo;t admit it, Char Magaro was working on climate change issues long before anyone else was really aware of it. Her activism on this issue, and others, emanates from her early work advocating for rainforest protection.</p>

<p>Over the years, Char allowed PennFuture to use her restaurants for fundraisers and other events. We always knew that our guests would feel welcomed and really appreciate Char&rsquo;s high standards and hospitality.</p>

<p>Char was key to the success of PennFuture&rsquo;s 10th anniversary gala. She conceived the look and the style of the event so that it rose to fit the stellar line of speakers including Al Gore, Rebecca Rimmel of Pew Charitable Trusts, and Teresa Heinz of The Heinz Endowments. It was elegant, coordinated and it ran smoothly because of Char&rsquo;s attention to detail.</p>

<p>Char was essential in the transition and recruitment of PennFuture&rsquo;s CEOs, often a time consuming process, not once but twice. Hours of meetings and interviews were involved in this process.Char had great influence on the board, many times offering a point of view which was unique and creative. She blended well with all of the different personalities and thought big picture.</p>

<p>For 16 years Char been a significant part of the life of PennFuture, as we have been part of her life. She has supported us financially, offered wise guidance, floated many ideas, led the board ably as chair, and has been an inspiration and friend to many of us.</p>

Trump Administration Rolls Back Air Protections from Fossil Fuel Plants,6/5/2020,"<p>Recently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency rolled back protections under the federal Mercury Air Toxics Standards regulations for both coal refuse plants and oil- and gas-fired plants.</p>

<p>The MATS for coal-and oil-fired electric generating units (EGUs) were promulgated by EPA on February 16, 2012. MATS established acid gas hazardous air pollutant emission standards for all coal-fired power plants.</p>

<p>If you live in Cambria or Venango County and want to help us fight against increased air pollution in your community, please contact PennFuture&rsquo;s Vice President of Legal &amp; Policy, Abigail Jones, by Friday, June 12. She can be reached at<a href=""mailto:jones@pennfuture.org"">jones@pennfuture.org</a> or by calling 570-216-3313.</p>

<p><u>Coal Refuse Plants</u></p>

<p>On April 15, EPA finalized a subcategory for plants, which would impact six EGUs that burn waste coal from other coal mining operations and use the ashes of mine reclamation projects. Four of those units (at three plants) are located in Pennsylvania: Scrubgrass Generating Company (Kennerdell, PA); Colver Power Project (Colver, PA); and Ebensburg Power (Ebensburg, PA).</p>

<p>The problem with this new subcategory is that it allows for more acid gas pollution from these plants. But, these plants were already meeting or certified to EPA that they would meet the acid gas emission limits set under the MATS, indicating that a subcategory that allows these facilities to pollute more is unjustified for the safe and continued operation of these plants.</p>

<p><u>Oil and Gas Fired Plants</u></p>

<p>On May 22,EPA issued an about-face regarding its 2016 decision that it is &ldquo;appropriate and necessary&rdquo; to regulate hazardous air pollutants from oil-and gas-fired EGUs under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA now claims that it is not appropriate and necessary to regulate emission these air toxics because the costs outweigh the benefits.</p>

<p>EPA&rsquo;s reversal of its prior determination, however, is based upon fundamental legal errors, flawed reasoning (including the failure to consider all benefits from the regulation), and is unauthorized under the CAA.</p>

<p>In April 2019, <a href=""/Files/Admin/Comments-of-Environmental-Public-Health-and-Civil-Rights-Orgs_.pdf"">PennFuture joined others in submitting comments</a> in opposition to both the proposed subcategory rule and EPA&rsquo;s revised &ldquo;appropriate and necessary&rdquo; finding in April 2019.</p>

<p>Both of these rollbacks have the potential to negatively impact our air quality in Pennsylvania. Our communities have already been plagued by the onslaught of cuts by the Trump Administration to the fundamental protections of our water quality and environment, and now the EPA is working hard to cut much needed protections to our air quality. We cannot let these unsupported and illegal rollbacks stand. PennFuture will fight for our right to clean air and pure water in Pennsylvania.</p>

"PennFuture Launches the Our Water, Our Future Campaign to Unify Erie Around Clean Water Goals",6/4/2020,"<p>After years of careful and intentional planning, PennFuture recently opened a new office in Erie. We initially envisioned an opening that included an office in downtown Erie, a press conference with local media, and a meet-and-greet opportunity for community members to connect with PennFuture leadership.</p>

<p>Like every other organization, our best laid plans evaporated in mid-March with the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic that would completely shut down Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy and our ability to travel.</p>

<p>Instead of a new office space or the benefit of in-person introductions and conversations, I started my new role as a Campaign Manager for Clean Water virtually with many emails that began &ldquo;I am writing to introduce myself&hellip; I&rsquo;d love to set up a Zoom meeting with you.&rdquo; Not exactly how we envisioned PennFuture&rsquo;s entry into Erie, of course.</p>

<p>I was worried about being able to connect with people and organizations remotely, but I have been incredibly surprised by the positive responses I have received. I have met remotely with dozens of people in northwestern Pennsylvania and beyond through Zoom and phone calls. From citizens and non-profit organizations to government agencies and others, I have been amazed by the breadth of work being done and passion for protecting our water resources. I have also seen the need for that work and its importance to be communicated to a broader audience.</p>

<p>Erie is the fifth PennFuture office to open in Pennsylvania. We now cover all four corners of the state in addition to our strong presence in Harrisburg. By expanding into Erie with the &ldquo;Our Water, Our Future&rdquo; campaign, PennFuture seeks to increase and amplify the voices for the environment and citizens of Erie by developing a coalition of existing organizations dedicated to protecting our most important asset: our water.</p>

<p>The initial goal for PennFuture in Erie is to bring together organizations to develop a Common Agenda for Clean Water Advocacy. The process for developing this agenda has been taking shape with COVID-19, economic struggles, racial inequality, and social unrest in the background.</p>

<p>As I sit meeting with people at my computer to discuss this very specific goal, the world is changing outside my window. It would be na&iuml;ve to think that this endeavor will not be impacted by this changing world. But now more than ever people need to organize and stand up for what is right. It is right to stand against inequality and injustice. It is right to stand up for environmental protection. The two are not mutually exclusive and both are intimately connected with our mental and physical wellbeing.</p>

<p>The intersection between inequality, injustice, and environmental protection is well illustrated by the situation with Erie Coke Corporation. For decades this plant, which sits directly on Presque Isle Bay, continued operations despite routinely skirting environmental regulations. Coal and contaminated waste water escaped into the nearby waterways and emissions with benzene and toluene above DEP action levels were regularly spewed into the air. The community surrounding Erie Coke has a 49 percent poverty rate and its population is 54 percent minority. Clearly an injustice was occurring that was disproportionately born by people who were already disenfranchised.</p>

<p>Citizen activists banded together to demand justice for all of Erie, but especially for the community directly surrounding the plant. They formed a group called Hold Erie Coke Accountable (HECA) and asked citizens to share their experiences. Through these actions, HECA raised awareness of the injustices of Erie Coke and eventually, continuous pressure from citizens and the City of Erie led to the plant&rsquo;s closure.</p>

<p>By unifying around a common goal, citizens and decision makers earned a huge win for Erie and accomplished a step in the right direction to defend the citizens living closest to the plant. I hope to build off of this success on a broader scale and bring people together to continuously protect our water resources, and in doing so, protect our citizens and preserve resources for future generations.</p>

<p>In a time filled with great uncertainty and fear, bringing people together for a positive common goal of protecting water resources has offered me solace and purpose. I look forward to working with the passionate people of Northwest Pennsylvania to advocate for the clean water that our lives and livelihoods depend on.</p>

PennFuture partners with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania on new field organizing program,6/2/2020,"<p>PennFuture has long believed that grassroots engagement is a key part of fulfilling our mission to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s air, water, and land.</p>

<p>To that end, we work to educate community members and inspire volunteers to take action to help protect our environment. We do this through a variety of engaging opportunities, from educational forums to writing Letters to the Editor, contacting our legislators and plenty of actions in between.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, we have built up an <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFutures-Advocates-for-Conservation-and-the-Environment-ACE-Program"">Advocates for Conservation and the Environment (ACE) program</a>, which organizes teams of non-partisan volunteers to educate state and federal legislators about conservation and environmental issues. How can our elected officials vote the right way without knowing the background of the issues?</p>

<p>This year we are excited to announce that we have started a new phase in this important work by creating a joint field program that will work in tandem with our strategic partners at <a href=""https://www.conservationpa.org/"">Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania (CVPA)</a>. The colleagues of the Field Team will build on the great work of both organizations to empower the residents of Pennsylvania to use their voices to advocate for sustainable policies.</p>

<p>The PennFuture and CVPA Field Team aims to make it easy for people to get involved in environmental advocacy. Equally important, we want to connect with the local groups to lift up local voices and help to highlight the work they are doing. Finally, PennFuture and Conservation Voters of PA are two distinct organizations with diverse staff expertise, which allows for great flexibility and varying opportunities for our volunteers.</p>

<p>Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic has required our new field program to reevaluate our initial plans. We were proud to pivot quickly and offer a virtual way to honor the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day through our first joint project:<a href=""/Blog-Item-Thirty-Days-of-Action"">the Act For Our Earth Challenge</a>. We offered one quick meaningful daily action that folks could take right from home; check out the <a href=""/earthday2020"">Archive </a>of actions and join us. Earth Day should be every day, after all!</p>

<p>Our Field Team will continue to offer virtual programming and opportunities to get involved this year. We will keep a keen eye on how our elected officials are prioritizing our environment amidst this public health crisis. One of our first priorities was watching closely as state legislators <a href=""/Blog-Item-Pennsylvania-General-Assembly-Punts-on-State-Budget-Passes-Stop-Gap-Measure-with-Level-Funding-for-Environmental-and-Conservation-Priorities"">debated and passed a short-term budget last week</a> that holds steady funding for environmental and conservation agencies and programs.</p>

<p>To break it down for our members, we&rsquo;re hosting <a href=""https://secure.everyaction.com/K02pzgwvsEiNQJjusicDLw2"">astate budget overview webinar this Thursday, June 4th</a>. Our PennFuture and Conservation Voters of PA policy experts will dive into how the budget process unfolds and how the decisions they&rsquo;ve made will affect our environment.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re incredibly excited about the opportunities we can now provide our members and the strength that our joint Field Team will no doubt add to our vital environmental movement. We know that we won&rsquo;t achieve our goals of a pro-environment Pennsylvania without a strong grassroots movement of residents calling upon our elected officials to vote the right way.</p>

"Pennsylvania General Assembly Punts on State Budget, Passes Stopgap Measure with Level Funding for Environmental and Conservation Priorities",6/1/2020,"<p>Late last week, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a five-month stopgap budget package to fund most of the state government through November 2020. While the state’s education funding has been appropriated for a full year, all other lines, including conservation and environmental protection, were largely funded at flat levels from the current 2019-2020 fiscal year. </p>

<p>PennFuture recognizes this stopgap budget is necessary because of the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, but we are nonetheless pleased that the plan holds steady funding for environmental and conservation agencies that protect our natural resources. Now is not the time to slash funding or otherwise undermine the work being done by these critical agencies, which work every day on behalf of the millions of Pennsylvanians who cherish clean air, pure water and a healthy environment. In addition, it's imperative that our state government makes real and meaningful investments on behalf of our environment as the legislative session moves forward this year.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Five-Month Spending Plan</u></strong></p>

<p>The $25.8 billion spending plan of the budget package was moved by the general fund appropriations bill called House Bill 2387 (Saylor). The legislation unfortunately called for cutting essential funding to the river basin commissions that do critical water quality and quantity work, protecting and restoring our Commonwealth’s rivers and streams. Thankfully, this year’s budget bill did not call for raiding special or dedicated environmental and conservation funds that are restricted and statutorily set aside for conservation projects.</p>

<p>The House and Senate will have to return to the appropriations work in Harrisburg after the November 3, 2020 election for a ‘sine die’—or ‘lame-duck’—legislative session to hammer out a supplemental appropriations bill for the remainder of the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Pennsylvania hasn’t seen a sine die session for almost 15 years and proponents of “good government” are rightfully concerned; legislators voting on the supplemental budget may be retiring or may have been defeated, but would still retain their seats for this session. Because of this and the projected $5.2 billion budget shortfall for this and next fiscal years, climbing out of this hole for funding will be a challenge. Filling this hole and even moving Pennsylvania to adequate investment levels for conservation and environmental protection will be a steep climb. </p>

<p>Some Members of the legislature will call for draconian cuts to these resources agencies and will try to move austerity measures like gutting our dedicated funds, such as the Environmental Stewardship Fund, Keystone Recreation, Parks, and Conservation Fund, and more. We must remember that these areas are not fluff that we can cut indiscriminately, but these are core functions of our state government. We must protect these funds and move to invest more in these agencies that have been cut more than 40 percent since 2002.</p>

<p><u><strong>What About Code Bills?</strong></u></p>

<p>In addition to the appropriations bill, the General Assembly often passes associated “code bills” that implement the budget across different areas. These code bills are often used to move nefarious pieces of legislation that, by themselves, wouldn’t make it through the legislature.</p>

<p>This year we tracked and analyzed an administrative code bill and two fiscal code bills that were a part of the budget package. First was the administrative code bill called Senate Bill 1027 (Gordner). For the most part, SB 1027 was ‘clean’ of bad policy riders, but did include a requirement for the Governor and his administration to notify the legislature when regulations would be suspended (temporary or otherwise) along with the normal processes already in place. This may create increased work and bureaucracy for an already underfunded and understaffed agency.</p>

<p>What’s more, we typically see a fiscal code bill accompany the state budget bill to direct and implement the spending plan. Due to COVID-19, this year we had an additional fiscal code bill—House Bill 2510 (Turzai)—moving federal dollars that have been spent to Harrisburg per the CARES Act from earlier this spring for response efforts. Even more troubling was the passage of the regular fiscal code bill—House Bill 1083 (Sankey)—which we called on the legislature to oppose its passage.</p>

<p>HB 1083 contains a shell-game of moving money from the personal income tax (PIT) revenue to support the Environmental Stewardship Fund (ESF/’Growing Greener’); for the last few years we have seen transfers of money from the Oil and Gas Lease Fund to the Environmental Stewardship Fund, via the Marcellus Legacy Fund, but that move was blocked per the fiscal code of the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most concerning provision slipped into HB 1083 and approved by the General Assembly and signed into law by Governor Wolf is a dangerous paragraph extending ‘preemption’ language for another 12 months OR until six months after the expiration of Governor Wolf’s March 6, 2020 disaster declaration and any renewals, whichever is later.</p>

<p>The bill explicitly says that it “prohibits the General Assembly or a local government from enacting or enforcing a law relating to the use, disposition, sale, or prohibition or restriction of single-use plastics.” Another giveaway to the plastics and petrochemical industry from our legislative leadership; it’s also another thumb in the eye of local governments and environmental advocates trying to move forward sound policy and solutions for their communities.</p>

<p>We appreciate the work of our environmental champions on this issue in the legislature, especially Leader Costa and Minority Appropriations Chairman Hughes in the Senate and Minority Environmental Resources Chairman Vitali and Minority Appropriations Chairman Bradford in the House.  </p>

<p><u><strong>Budget Advocacy is Critical</strong></u></p>

<p>This year’s budget week was full of drama, and the budget process in Pennsylvania still isn’t anything close to transparent or inviting of public participation and input outside of a small circle of insiders and leaders in the “Peoples’ House.” Despite the pandemic restrictions put in place this year, PennFuture has remained a leader for the environmental community in the trenches of this year’s budget fight and worked hard to keep up environmental investments and keep out bad policy. Budget advocacy, it’s true, took a different form this time around, but our mission remained to ensure Pennsylvania’s budget is a ‘moral document’ and a values statement. </p>

<p>It’s been said, often tongue-in-cheek, that if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu. We will continue to make sure the voices of the environmental and conservation advocates are at the table as we wrap up legislative session in Harrisburg this spring and as we piece together the second half of our Commonwealth’s budget package in the fall.</p>

"Fundraising, Events, and COVID-19",5/18/2020,"<p>On Monday, March 9th<span mso-bidi-theme-font:="""" style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>what seems like a lifetime ago<span mso-bidi-theme-font:="""" style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>PennFuture and 35 other environmental groups from acrossthe state participated in the &quot;Fighting for Our Future: Pushing Back Against Taxpayer Subsidies for Fossil Fuels&quot; rally at the State Capitol.</p>

<p><a href=""/Blog-Item-Fighting-for-Our-Future"">More than 100 people turned out</a> to encourage Gov.Wolf&rsquo;s veto of House Bill 1100, which would have provided ridiculous incentives and billions in taxpayer subsidies to lure more petrochemical plants to Pennsylvania.We&rsquo;re very glad to say that the Governor did veto the bill, though the Legislature could still mount an attempt to override that veto. We are proud to have packed the room during the rally, but it&rsquo;s obvious that more people would have attended if not for fears about the coronavirus pandemic, which was just starting to spread in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>A week later on March 16,all PennFuture staff were working from home, and all PennFuture events had been either cancelled or postponed. It was up to us to improvise and find a way to still do our important work virtually, in accordance with quarantine and stay-at-home orders implemented in mid-March.</p>

<p>Our first effort at working within the new normal was partnering with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania. In that partnership, we were able to successfully pivot the in-person Earth Day events we had planned <a href=""/Blog-Item-Thirty-Days-of-Action"">into a 30-Day Challenge online</a> to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day virtually.</p>

<p>Other events were left in limbo, including our <a href=""/Event-PennFutures-Sixth-Annual-Celebrating-Women-in-Conservation-Awards"">6th Annual Women in Conservation Awards Dinner</a>. It was to be held on April 30th at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, and we were really looking forward to it! Each year, PennFuture honors the accomplishments of exceptional women conservationists in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The awards are designed to encourage continuing excellence in conservation and to forge a stronger network of exceptional women working to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment. Each year the event moves to a different part of the state to honor these women: this year to Southwest Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Before I continue on about the event, let&rsquo;s take a moment to congratulate the 2020 Women in Conservation Honorees:</p>

<p>With a list like this it would have been a night to remember. Having it at the National Aviary would have made it unforgettable. The Aviary is a bird-lover&rsquo;s treasure. Two years ago PennFuture hosted a fundraising party there to honor our retiring president Larry Schweiger. A bald eagle greeted our guests across from the check-in table. Cocktails were had with flamingos. Along with the amazing food and beverages served in view of the penguin exhibit, we also had visits to our dinner tables by an owl and a falcon. Combine that with family and friends coming together to celebrate these women&mdash;live events don&rsquo;t get much better than that.</p>

<p>We knew we had to postpone it. At first we thought we could schedule it for June, but quickly realized even that would be too soon. Now, we hope we can have the event safely at the Aviary on October 8th but know that it may not be possible to have a live event at all this year. Later this summer, if we determine we can still have the event live, we&rsquo;ll be sure to let everyone know and make tickets available for purchase. If instead we have to host a virtual event, we&rsquo;ll do so with enthusiasm and hope that you can join us in safely honoring these women, in whatever way we can.</p>

<p>The Women in Conservation event is a fundraising event for PennFuture. The funds it brings in from our generous sponsors and from tickets sales provide unrestricted support for our environmental watchdog work. Not having the event makes it more difficult for us to do this work.</p>

<p>Most of PennFuture&rsquo;s funds come from grants which are restricted to very specific projects which are planned out months, if not years, in advance. Unrestricted funds from events and from individual donors allow us to have the flexibility we need to respond to environmental threats in real time. For example, if not for the generosity of a handful of concerned donors this spring, we would not have been able to quickly organize the March rally against HB1100 and create the successful publicity campaign around it. Unrestricted dollars make a difference.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I want to give a special shout out to the corporate sponsors of the 2020 Women in Conservation Dinner who have stayed with us in their support during these difficult times. Thank you to NextEra Energy Resources, Signature Financial, MaherDuessel, and CLA (CliftonLarsonAllen)! If you are affiliated with a company that is interested in joining them in sponsoring the 2020 Women in Conservation Awards, please let us know.</p>

<p>Though it has been difficult for us, and all charities, to change and postpone our fundraising events, there has been some good news this spring for the nonprofit world. <strong>The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provides three new incentives for donors to contribute to their favorite charities this year:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>There is now a $300 above-the-line ($600 for couples!) charitable income tax deduction. What this means is that if you make a donation in 2020, and don&rsquo;t itemize on your 2020 taxes, then you can now give $300 to charity and get a full $300 tax break in addition to the standard deduction. That&rsquo;s right, your donation today is 100% deductible. There&rsquo;s never been an incentive like this before to give to the causes you care about!</li>
	<li>If you do itemize, then there is a benefit for you too! The new law allows for cash contributions to qualified charities such as PennFuture to be deducted up to 100% of your adjusted gross income for 2020. Ordinarily, the income tax charitable deduction for cash gifts is limited to 60% of your income. This 100% limit allows you to reduce your 2020 federal income tax to zero. Your charitable deductions in 2020 cannot exceed 100% of your income, but you may be able to carry unused charitable deductions forward to future years. Please check with your financial advisors to determine whether the 100% deduction makes sense for your specific circumstances.</li>
	<li>IRA donations: For 2020, there will be no mandatory distributions from retirement accounts (whatever the age of the owner), thus allowing those accounts to recover. The minimum age for making a tax-free transfer from an IRA to a charity remains at 70&frac12;, and the annual limit remains at $100,000. However, since cash gifts are deductible in 2020 to the extent of adjusted gross income (100%), a person could withdraw and then contribute a larger amount&mdash;with the deduction offsetting the taxable withdrawal. Again, please check with your financial advisor regarding this.</li>
</ol>

<p>We know that right now making a charitable donation may be the last thing on your mind, and perhaps something not even possible to consider. The pandemic has created unfortunate and worrisome economic conditions. If you or your family have been adversely impacted by workplace closures or furloughs, you have our deepest sympathies. We are thinking of you and hope to hear from you when things get better.</p>

<p>However, if you are in a position to make a donation to PennFuture, or to any other charity you care about this year, then because of the CARES Act it may be one of the most economically advantageous times to do so. Think of it as a stimulus donation.</p>

<p>These are difficult, unprecedented, and unpredictable times we are living in. Nothing can be done as it was before. Before we do anything we now first think &ldquo;how can I do this safely?&rdquo; And if we can&rsquo;t do it safely then how do we &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; and change our expectations so that we can be safe? It requires determination and flexibility to stay successful. And it requires trust and hope to make it worthwhile.</p>

<p>PennFuture is determined to be your environmental watchdog regardless of the challenging circumstances, and we are very grateful for the trust you have given us to support this work.<br />
We hope to see you at the National Aviary in October to celebrate the 2020 Women in Conservation honorees.</p>

<p>Stay safe!</p>

Pennsylvania Legislators Send Deregulatory Bill to Wolf’s Desk,5/15/2020,"<p>What was for the most part a quiet week in Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania State Senate and House of Representatives met for a few days to continue to move a suite of bills to reopen different sectors of businesses and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy. Both chambers also continued to move code bills preparing for the state&rsquo;s budget season, in earnest, with the House moving nine appropriations bills for varying boards, commissions, and agencies.</p>

<p>Equally concerning is that the legislative leadership at the State Capitol is still using the cover of the COVID-19 public health crisis to move deregulatory bills. Instead of increasing protections for Pennsylvanians, members of the General Assembly used this opportunity to approve blocking numerous environmental regulations.</p>

<p>On May 13, the State Senate met to amend and move Senate Bill 327 out of the Senate Rules Committee and push a concurrence vote before the entire Senate before heading back to the House. The bill received a party-line vote with a few members pushing back against the provision blocking regulations.</p>

<p>SB 327 seeks to undermine the regulatory authority of our agencies&mdash;environmental and other&mdash;that are tasked with safeguarding Pennsylvanians&rsquo; public health. This legislation would stop any proposed or final-form environmental regulation from being finalized until at least 90 days after the March 6th COVID-19 emergency declaration by the Governor is terminated. Specifically, this could drastically impact the ability for state agencies to continue their work protecting Pennsylvanians. This bill jettisons Pennsylvanians&rsquo; rights to environmental protection for what could be many months, and this is simply unacceptable.</p>

<p>Further, SB 327 moves to unnecessarily lengthen the regulatory review process and could delay implementation of regulations that are critical to keeping us safe. It is irresponsible to indefinitely abandon work that aims to keep our air and water clean.</p>

<p>This bill would affect: a proposed regulation setting water quality standards for harmful neurotoxin manganese; a proposed regulation establishing cleanup standards for PFAS water contamination; a final regulation to reduce deaths related to air pollution by reducing sulfur in heating oil; a proposed regulation redesignating the water quality protection for over 40 streams; a proposed carbon dioxide reduction program, and more.</p>

<p>The legislation puts in jeopardy hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government that aids in our state regulatory agencies&rsquo; ability to do their jobs. SB 327 may very well cause our Commonwealth to abdicate primacy and its own administration of federal programs and could result in the federal government taking over these programs.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny) spoke up in defense against SB 327. He made the case that this legislation would impact &ldquo;many regulations proposed by our agencies&hellip;[which] now will be tolled or stopped. Some of the most important regulations are environmental ones...we need to proceed with them.&rdquo; Leader Costa continued to advocate for moving these critical protections forward, getting public comment, and advancing the process for Pennsylvania to link its carbon emissions reduction program to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which would bring millions of dollars in proceeds to the Commonwealth that could be used for clean air projects and be reinvested in our workers, infrastructure, and more.</p>

<p>We thank Senator Costa for his comments supporting transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Due to the blocking of regulations in SB 327, Costa argued, &ldquo;this bill is inappropriate to move forward at this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On May 14th, in a surprise voting session that was called by Speaker Turzai the evening prior, the House leadership called up Senate Bill 327 for concurrence&mdash;the final vote in the House chamber before being sent to the Governor for his consideration. After robust debate and defense from environmental champions in the Legislature, SB 327 was approved by the House by a largely party-line vote (108-94). We appreciate Representative Todd Stephens (R-Montgomery) who joined the House Democratic caucus in opposing this bill in the final vote.</p>

<p>Rep. Kevin Boyle (D-Montgomery/Philadelphia) rose to speak against SB 327 during the floor debate and said that the bill was troubling and he urged a &lsquo;no&rsquo; vote because it &ldquo;suspends all new regulations during the entire duration of the emergency COVID-19 declaration.&rdquo; He continued to share that, &ldquo;Harvard University said that our current emergency could last until 2022&hellip;[Boyle] couldn&rsquo;t help but think [SB 327] was more about a deregulatory agenda instead of COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We also appreciate the salient remarks from House Environmental Resources Minority Chair Rep. Greg Vitali (D-Delaware) and House Minority Leader Frank Dermody (D-Allegheny) who posited that SB 327 would cause &ldquo;huge problems for the environment and will cost the Commonwealth millions of dollars in funding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before calling for a final vote to move the bill to Governor Wolf, House Majority Leader Rep. Bryan Cutler (R-Lancaster) made the troubling comment that &ldquo;if the Governor can suspend our economy, we can suspend regulations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are thankful that Governor Wolf has already committed to vetoing Senate Bill 327 when he receives the legislation and we are grateful for those in Harrisburg who continue to fight&mdash;even during this pandemic&mdash;against all the attacks on our protections and funding to keep our air and water clean.</p>

<p>We continue to work as your watchdogs in the halls of Harrisburg and take that duty seriously.</p>

It’s Time to Move the RGGI Rulemaking Process Forward,5/14/2020,"<p>It&rsquo;s been a little over seven months since Governor Tom Wolf&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/executive-order-2019-07-commonwealth-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change-through-electric-sector-emissions-reductions/"">Executive Order 2019-07</a> which instructed the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to develop a cap-and-invest program to control carbon pollution from power plants in Pennsylvania that aligns with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).</p>

<p>The concept of this rule is simple. Instead of letting power plants dump carbon pollution in our air for free, they will have to pay a price that is determined through an auction.Not only will that encourage more innovation in reducing emissions, but the money can be re-invested to further reduce air pollution.This has been very successful with the rest of the 10RGGI states seeing benefits of <a href=""https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">$1.4 billion in net economic benefits</a> from 2015 to 2017.</p>

<p>Having to pay to pollute isn&rsquo;t popular with polluters, and their friends began the attacks right away.The chronically ill-informed Rep. Metcalfe (R-Butler) went so far as to declare that the Governor&rsquo;s plan was illegal on the very day of the Executive Order&mdash;well before the actual plan was even written.Since then, the opposition has put a little more effort in their talking points, but the level of misinformation is still pretty high.</p>

<p>One common line of attack has been that the DEP is developing this program without the &ldquo;robust public outreach&rdquo; the governor promised&mdash;this couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth.As a member of <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Air/BAQ/AdvisoryGroups/Air-Quality-Technical-Advisory-Committee/Pages/default.aspx"">DEP&rsquo;s Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee</a> (AQTAC) I&rsquo;ve had a front row seat as the first drafts of the regulatory language were developed,but our meetings are always open to the public and always invite public comment either in person or in writing.More importantly, DEP has listened to the comments and responded by both making changes to their proposal and releasing more detailed information.It&rsquo;s true DEP hasn&rsquo;t adopted every suggestion (<a href=""/Blog-Item-DEP-is-Asking-Us-to-Pick-Up-the-Bill-for-Waste-CoalAgain"">mine included</a>), but they are still in the early stages.</p>

<p>Developing a regulation in Pennsylvania is a slow process guided by a law known as the Regulatory Review Act, <a href=""http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/resources/docs/Regulatory_Review_Process_Manual.PDF"">detailed in a 48 page manual</a> for those who want to dig deeper.This requires a formal public comment period and review by the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, the Legislature, and the Attorney General among other steps.When this is pointed out, opponents fall back on their second claim that this is just the &ldquo;bare minimum&rdquo; and therefore still not &ldquo;robust&rdquo; enough. </p>

<p>Of course that is also a lie.The law doesn&rsquo;t require that DEP go through the AQTAC review process, by doing that alone they are already doing more than the minimum. In fact, while some have raised concerns that COVID-19 would make transparency in regulatory development more difficult, virtual meetings are turning out to be a success.At its peak, our last AQTAC meeting had more than 200 attendees&mdash;far more than the capacity of our normal meeting room.</p>

<p>Public participation is a very important part of any rulemaking process. There are certainly voices that need to be heard and concerns that must be addressed to make sure the final rule is the best it can be, but I can say with confidence that the corporate complainers aren&rsquo;t interested in a better rule.They want to kill this rulemaking process by whatever means necessary and saying outreach hasn&rsquo;t been robust enough is nothing more than a convenient soundbite. How do we know this is true? The same people who are doing the complaining are also trying to stop the DEPs rulemaking process before the formal public comment period even starts.</p>

<p>Next week, on May 19th, the DEP <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/CitizensAdvisoryCouncil/Meetings/Pages/default.aspx"">is going to make a presentation</a> to the Citizens Advisory Council (CAC) and ask them to recommend that the package be sent to the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) for consideration.If approved by the EQB, the DEP will then open the formal public comment period and start the public participation process in earnest.</p>

<p>The opposition are sure to make their voices heard at the meeting. They may complain about the lack of outreach, but that&rsquo;s just a cover for their real ask of a gift for polluters.It&rsquo;s important that the people be heard as well, and that is what CAC should recommend.Unfortunately, that isn&rsquo;t a sure thing.</p>

<p>There are enough representatives on CAC tied to polluting interests that the &ldquo;Citizens&rdquo; Advisory Council could actually recommend not moving forward with the public comment period and, therefore, not giving any other citizens a voice in the matter. We need to let them know that opening a public comment period on the rule is the right thing to do.If you want your voice heard at the meeting, you can contact Keith Salador at ksalador@pa.gov or (717) 787-8171 to get on the list to testify.</p>

The Colors of a Pandemic,5/13/2020,"<p>I&rsquo;m writing this from southern Luzerne County, where I&rsquo;ve been working since March 16 when the whole of PennFuture&rsquo;s team went to a work-from-home policy to help us safely ride out this phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am grateful for those elected officials, community volunteers, and every frontline worker who is playing a part to help us weather this horrendous virus that has upended our communities, country and the world. I wish safety and good health to all.</p>

<p>The pain of loss and disruption caused by this virus is felt everywhere. But our Earth is breathing again, even as human lungs are under viral attack. The air is notably cleaner, lost hues are making it back into our sunrises and sunsets. The blue of our skies is amplified and crystal.</p>

<p>Wildlife is liberated as people hunker down. Songbirds are back and occupying new locales made quieter from the lack of traffic. They can hear each other sing to prospective mates, no longer drowned out by motors and jake brakes.</p>

<p>All that seems to be coming to an end. The people of the United States have found a way to let an insidious and indiscriminate killer like COVID-19 fracture us even further. The red, white and blue of the American flag has not emerged as the true colors of this national emergency as it did after the September 11, 2001 attacks. We&rsquo;ve not found a unity symbol of &ldquo;alone but together,&rdquo; at least not in my community.</p>

<p>Three weeks ago, we marked the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day, which was April 22, 1970.From the people&rsquo;s struggles against the Vietnam War, racism and poverty, alarms went up around a growing ecological crisis:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The unsustainable expansion of humans into all corners of, and habitats on, planet Earth;</li>
	<li>Pollution-induced profits increasingly lording over the welfare of the people; and</li>
	<li>Poisoning of our air, water and atmosphere.</li>
</ul>

<p>The emerging science and data of the COVID-19 pandemic is telling us that our inability to address the ecological and social issues of the last 50 years is driving the worst attributes of this virus&rsquo; origins and helping define many of its victims&mdash;the black, the brown, and the unhealthy, all made more vulnerable because of weaknesses in the natural systems that sustain life, most notably the air we breathe, the quality of the places we live and the kind of food we eat. And the virus is illuminating the weaknesses in the economic drivers in which we&rsquo;ve invested for decades.</p>

<p>We expect a different normal going forward. We understand that how we generate income, socialize, educate, recreate and coexist as communities will change and must change given the extent to which the past bad decisions and poor investments made, and &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve elected have gotten us to this moment in time. We must not fail in re-shaping these basic aspects of our future, having been given an unforeseen opportunity in the form of a horrible pandemic that is crushing every normal we know.</p>

<p>We must reinvent our society through the lens of equality and sustainability. But Pennsylvania has many Achilles Heels in regard to our ability to re-create a future where authentic resiliency of our economy, our environment and our people takes the lead. We have opposition here to livable wages; we have unions that are resistant to change, entrenched in old industries and mindsets; we have centuries of reliance on fossil fuel industries that have created jobs at the expense of workers&rsquo; health and the environment; diverse voices are suppressed in our civic systems and disparate viewpoints are suppressed in deliberative government bodies; and now, we have politicized a pandemic making bridging these dynamics&mdash;and so many others&mdash;an even harder undertaking.</p>

<p>But we have an unprecedented opportunity before us and cannot be deterred by these unflattering attributes of our state: The federal government has the capacity and power to create stimulus funding and programs that must salvage our tattered small businesses; create commensurate employment opportunities for workers and sectors where job loss is projected to be permanent or semi-permanent; and create jobs and training for the hardest hit, including our 2020 high school and college graduates and less skilled individuals. We must make a just and progressive mark on these funds and programs.</p>

<p>PennFuture has an important perspective to bring to the stimulus and recovery discussions, in the form of ideas for programs, projects and funding that can drive a rebuilding of our state centered on sustainability and equity. We will be sharing that soon.</p>

<p>The other opportunity is that we are in an election year, and it is critical that every eligible voter exercises their right to vote. Please vote for individuals who have articulated an unambiguous commitment to a very, very different future for Pennsylvania and our country.</p>

<p>Senator Gaylord Nelson&mdash;the father of Earth Day&mdash;called for &quot;a new national coalition whose objective is to put quality for human life on a par with Gross National Product.&quot;</p>

<p>Plainly said and still direly needed today. Let&rsquo;s activate and do our parts to ensure that our recovery leads to a green future.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get it right this time around, beginning with our home state of Pennsylvania.</p>

PennFuture Releases Updated Stream Redesignation Handbook: A Step-by-Step Guide for Local Stream Protection Efforts,5/11/2020,"<p>Across the state, local conservation and watershed groups are recognizing the superior water quality of their streams and are engaging in the process to upgrade stream protections. To support these grassroots efforts, PennFuture has released an updated version of our <a href=""/Files/Admin/PF_StreamHandbook2019_web_2.10.20.pdf"">Stream Redesignation Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>This 82-page manual serves as a guide for those looking to protect and maintain local stream quality by walking through the various steps of the official regulatory process, explaining the information needed for the petition, and recommending ways to garner support for the redesignation petition.</p>

<p>This can be a complicated process, so let&rsquo;s first take some time to explain the terminology and processes of state regulations currently in place.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is blessed with more than 86,000 miles of streams, and the quality of these waters is protected through Pennsylvania&rsquo;s water quality standards, which include a &ldquo;designated use&rdquo; for each and every surface water.&ldquo;Uses&rdquo; include classifications like aquatic life, recreation, and special protection waters.</p>

<p>Fewer than 5 percent of our waters, however, are designated as special protection waters<span mso-fareast-language:="""" mso-fareast-theme-font:="""" new="""" style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"" times="""">&mdash;</span>either High Quality (HQ) or Exceptional Value (EV)<span mso-fareast-language:="""" mso-fareast-theme-font:="""" new="""" style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"" times="""">&mdash;</span>which recognizes the most outstanding water quality in the state and confers the strongest protections. </p>

<p>Designated uses can be thought of as water quality goals of the state, and in some cases, they do not reflect the actual better water quality of a stream or stream segment. In those cases, it is appropriate to petition the PA Department of Environmental Protection to &ldquo;redesignate,&rdquo; or upgrade, the designated use of the stream so that more stringent protections will be in place to protect and maintain the better water quality. Check out Our Pocono Waters&rsquo; webinar <a href=""https://youtu.be/DBWr4aFUvgM"">&ldquo;Intro to Clean Streams Regulations in PA&rdquo;</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Our newly revised Stream Redesignation Handbook is the definitive guide for wading through the redesignation process in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In addition to promoting strong water quality regulations, PennFuture also monitors and opposes any efforts to undermine clean water protections, and so our Handbook also provides guidance on how to fight proposed rollbacks of designated use protections</p>

<p>Our state&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection should be swiftly acting on opportunities to upgrade the quality of our streams, expanding healthy fisheries, and areas where we can safely enjoy a summer swim. Successful efforts to increase stream protections include the redesignation of lower French Creek and Beaver Run in Chester County and Swiftwater Creek in Monroe County from HQ to EV.</p>

<p>Finally, these designations are not barriers to development. Antidegradation regulations still allow activities to be permitted in both HQ and EV watersheds, provided the discharges protect existing water quality.</p>

<p>For example, developments approved in the upper French Creek watershed following EV designation include the French Creek Golf Course Community in Warwick and East &amp; West Nantmeal Townships, as well as the Weatherstone development by Hankin Group in West Vincent Township. And in Monroe County, Kalahari Resort &amp; Conventions was built and the Poconos Springs Entertainment Village is being proposed along the banks of the EV Swiftwater Creek.</p>

<p>Upgrading stream protections is important to our environment and also our communities and local economies.The process to upgrade stream designations in Pennsylvania does not have to be confusing or overwhelming with PennFuture&rsquo;s Stream Redesignation Handbook as a guide.</p>

U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Attempts to Restrict the Clean Water Act’s Protections For Discharges Through Groundwater,5/7/2020,"<p>Last month, the Supreme Court of the United States issued arguably <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-260_5i36.pdf"">its most important Clean Water Act decision</a> in the past decade.</p>

<p>The issue in the case of <em>County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund</em> was whether the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) requires a permit when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters by a nonpoint source, which in this case isgroundwater.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ultimately held that a permit is required if the addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the &ldquo;functional equivalent&rdquo; of a direct discharge from the point source into navigable waters. While issuing no bright-line rule, the Supreme Court identified several factors for courts to consider when applying this functional equivalent standard in the future.</p>

<p>There is much to unpack in this decision, so a quick overview of the CWA requirements and definitions is helpful.</p>

<p>Section 301 of the CWA requires a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for the discharge of any pollutant from a point source into a waterbody.</p>

<ul>
	<li>&ldquo;Pollutant&rdquo; is defined by the CWA to include things like solid waste, heat, sewage, chemical wastes, and biological wastes.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Point source&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance...from which pollutants are or may be discharged,&rdquo; including for example, any &ldquo;container,&rdquo; &ldquo;pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, or conduit,&rdquo; or &ldquo;well.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Discharge of a pollutant&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters [including the territorial seas] from any point source.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>And while there&rsquo;s been much controversy lately over the Trump Administration&rsquo;s limiting of the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States,&rdquo; there is no argument that groundwater is not covered by the CWA. Rather, Congress left primary responsibility for groundwater protections to the individual states. For example, in Pennsylvania, our Clean Streams law explicitly includes groundwater in the definition of &ldquo;waters of the Commonwealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So back to Maui. In 2012, several environmental groups filed a CWA citizen suit in federal district court arguing that the County of Maui&rsquo;s wastewater reclamation facility&rsquo;s four underground injection wells used to dispose of treated wastewater required an NPDES permit since the injected effluent travels through the groundwater which flows into the Pacific Ocean. The district court agreed with the environmental groups, and the County of Maui appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>While the Ninth Circuit upheld the lower court&rsquo;s decision in 2018, it set forth a different standard than the district court as to why the indirect discharge (i.e., through groundwater) of a pollutant requires a NPDES permit in this case: a permit is required because &ldquo;pollutants are fairly traceable from the point source to a navigable water such that the discharge is the functional equivalent of a discharge into the navigable water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court agreed to hear the County of Maui&rsquo;s appeal of the Ninth Circuit decision. You can read about our former Senior Attorney Alice Baker&rsquo;s trip to the Supreme Court to hear the oral argument in the Maui case <a href=""/Blog-Item-A-Trip-to-the-Supreme-Court"">by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court focused on the word &ldquo;from&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;discharge of a pollutant,&quot; which led to some <a href=""https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/18-260"">interesting examples of spiking the punch</a> during oral argument.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the environmental groups argued that the Ninth Circuit standard is correct with the addition that the point source must be a &ldquo;proximate cause of the addition of pollutants to navigable waters.&rdquo; On the other hand, the County of Maui and the Trump Administration (an amicus curiae in the case) argued the very extreme opposite that basically the groundwater cuts off any liability under the CWA.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court rejected both of these standards as either resulting in requiring permitting in &ldquo;surprising, even bizarre circumstances&rdquo; or creating &ldquo;such a large and obvious loophole&rdquo; in the CWA&rsquo;s permitting structure.</p>

<p>Instead, the Supreme Court held that the CWA requires a NPDES permit when an indirect discharge of pollutants into navigable waters is the &ldquo;functional equivalent of a direct discharge,&rdquo; that is, when a discharge from a point source &ldquo;reaches the same result through roughly similar means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In coming to this standard, the Court recognizes the natural limits imposed by the CWA&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;from&rdquo; as it relates to the need for a &ldquo;point source&rdquo; and identifies some bookends to its test (e.g., a few feet of groundwater versus 50 miles). But the Court also recognizes that they have offered no bright-line test and instead offered seven factors to consider for the &ldquo;middle instances&rdquo; between the bookends:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Transit time</li>
	<li>Distance traveled,</li>
	<li>The nature of the material through which the pollutant travels,</li>
	<li>The extent to which the pollutant is diluted or chemically changed as it travels,</li>
	<li>The amount of pollutant entering the navigable waters relative to the amount of the pollutant that leaves the point source,</li>
	<li>The manner by or area in which the pollutant enters the navigable waters, and</li>
	<li>The degree to which the pollution (at that point) has maintained its specific identity.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Court states clearly that &ldquo;[t]ime and distance will be the most important factors in most cases, but not necessarily every case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision also seems to balance several policy considerations in developing this new standard for review, including the preservation of states&rsquo; primary authority to regulate groundwater, the CWA&rsquo;s inclusion of wells in its definition of point source, the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) longstanding practice of permitting groundwater discharges in some circumstances, and <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/npdes/interpretative-statement-releases-pollutants-point-sources-groundwater"">EPA&rsquo;s 2019 Interpretive Statement</a> on permitting requirements from groundwater.</p>

<p>The decision concluded with some additional guidance for lower courts since the Court is the first to admit that administration of its functional equivalent test may not be easy: as lower courts hear similar cases and may refine the principles set forth in Maui, such decisions must neither undermine state regulation of groundwater nor create loopholes that undermine the CWA&rsquo;s basic federal regulatory objectives.</p>

<p>The Maui case will go back to the Ninth Circuit to reconsider the case in light of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s new &ldquo;functional equivalent&rdquo; standard.</p>

<p>For now, however, I think that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s rejection of the extreme positions taken by the County of Maui and the Trump Administration is something to be celebrated. With the almost constant attack from the Administration on our bedrock environmental laws, this is just the boost that environmental groups&ndash;and the health of our Nation&rsquo;s waters&ndash;needed. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Clean Streams Law is strong, but a strong federal Clean Water Act is also needed to ensure the health of over 80,000 miles of streams in the Commonwealth.</p>

"PA House Leaders Push Bills to Thwart Environmental Protections, Attack Conservation Funding",5/5/2020,"<p>Anti-environmental legislators in the Pennsylvania General Assembly are using the COVID-19 public health crisis as a cover to move bills to block any proposed or final environmental regulations and to attack dedicated environmental and conservation funds.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen more than a dozen attempts just this legislative session to repeal and roll back critical protections, but now leadership in the House of Representatives is quickly moving two dangerous bills to halt critical environmental regulations that were in the works before the pandemic began.</p>

<p>On April 17, House State Government Committee Chair Garth Everett (R-Lycoming) introduced House Bill 2416, and on April 20, the committee approved the bill on party-line vote.</p>

<p>HB 2416 would stop any proposed or final environmental or other state agency regulation from being finalized until at least 90 days after the March 6th COVID-19 emergency declaration by the Governor is terminated. Everett&rsquo;s bill seems to fit the &ldquo;demands&rdquo; made by House Environmental Resources and Energy Chairman Daryl Metcalfe that the Department of Environmental Protection suspend or roll back environmental regulations during the ongoing pandemic. You can read more about <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/thebark2"">PennFuture&rsquo;s comments on this letter here.</a></p>

<p>The legislation also stipulates that no proposed regulation may be submitted in final form to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) or the House and Senate committees. The bill allows state agencies to petition appropriate standing committees of the Senate and House&mdash;solely controlled by House leadership&mdash;for a waiver from the prohibition against publishing regulations. Additionally, the bill blocks final regulations from being promulgated as regulations by the Department of Environmental Protection or any other agency.</p>

<p>HB 2416 provides no requirement for the committees to take any action on the request. This legislation seemingly raises noteworthy issues with the Pennsylvania Constitution, because the bill allows for indefinite tolling of regulations without employing the regular legislative process and other deliberative bodies such as the opposite chamber and the Governor&rsquo;s approval.</p>

<p>This legislation would have real implications on several protections and regulatory actions in the proposed or final forms of rulemaking including: increasing fees for unconventional oil and gas well permits, setting air emissions standards for oil and gas operations (such as volatile organic compounds and methane), establishing standards for cleaning up PFOS and PFOA contamination, redesignation for water quality protection for dozens of streams, and setting up a carbon dioxide reduction program, among others.</p>

<p>PennFuture and partners fought back against HB 2416 and was successful in blocking the bill from receiving third consideration and final passage votes last week, though it may come back as the House continues its legislative session. SB 327, an administrative code bill setting up a COVID-19 response task force, was amended two weeks ago to include a provision with regulatory tolling language identical to HB 2416. We&rsquo;ll continue to push back against both anti-regulatory bills in the House and Senate. HB 2416 remains on the House calendar and SB 327 is currently awaiting action in the Senate Rules Committee.</p>

<p>With the rapid action of these fast-tracked administrative code bills, PennFuture will remain vigilant and we call on members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly to oppose both House Bill 2416 and Senate Bill 327.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, those aren&rsquo;t the only bad bills we&rsquo;re watching in Harrisburg.</p>

<p>On April 21st, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives&rsquo; leadership took a bill&mdash;House Bill 1822&mdash;meant for giving small municipalities low-interest loans and financial support for COVID-19 response hostage and added a dangerous amendment that would freeze new expenditures for sixteen special funds, including eight funds related to conservation and the environment.</p>

<p>A few of those eight funds include the Environmental Stewardship Fund (Growing Greener), the Keystone Recreation, Park, and Conservation Fund, the Recycling Fund, and the County Conservation District Fund.The Pennsylvania House adopted this amendment from House Appropriations Chair Stan Saylor (R-York) and sent it to the Senate for its consideration, where it remains in the Senate Rules Committee.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more: on the morning of May 5, the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, chaired by Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R-Butler), held a voting meeting in Harrisburg to approve another attack on environmental and conservation funding, via House Bill 2004, sponsored by Rep. Jason Ortitay (R-Allegheny/Washington).</p>

<p>This legislation seeks to take control of allocating money in key environmental and conservation funds, such as Keystone Recreation, Parks, and Conservation Fund, from the executive branch agencies to the General Assembly. After Rep. Ortitay mentioned that the Keystone Fund should be opened to compete against other funding priorities, it&rsquo;s evident that legislators in Harrisburg are using this abnormal budget season as an opportunity to put a wildly popular thirty-year-old program at risk. What&rsquo;s being called a measure to &lsquo;tighten the belt&rsquo; of the Commonwealth is nothing more than an austerity measure.</p>

<p>We wholly reject this frame. Our natural resources are necessary and conservation, protection, maintenance of these are a core function of our government. We appreciate Minority Chairman Vitali&rsquo;s (D-Delaware/Montgomery) leadership against this bill in committee along with the steadfast advocacy from Reps. Leanne Krueger (D-Delaware) and Rep. Mary Isaacson (D-Philadelphia).</p>

<p>Rep. Krueger rightfully reminded her colleagues that, being in the middle of a pandemic, timing on moving HB 2004 was questionable. She made the case that the bill would significantly change how Pennsylvania funds our parks, trails, ballparks, and more. Rep. Krueger added that the Keystone Fund has worked for thirty years and now the legislature wants to put it in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Rep. Isaacson admonished the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee members, saying that the legislature needs to be careful: &ldquo;this is a restricted fund...this was created to protect treasures in our state that are for everyone. This fund is not to be subject to the will and whims of this General Assembly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unacceptable that these critical funds are being used as bargaining chips during this budget season and PennFuture wholly opposes HBs 1822 and 2004, which are nothing more than attacks on our clean air and water. Proponents of these bills are using libraries, historic preservation, recreation, conservation, and our state parks and forests as pawns - chess pieces for leverage in the budget fight, and as made clear by Chairman Daryl Metcalfe today, movement of these bills is tied to opposition to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s COVID-19 stay-at-home orders.</p>

Thirty Days of Action,5/4/2020,"<p>Sometimes, your best-laid plans evaporate in an instant and you&rsquo;re forced to improvise on the fly. So it was for the entire month of April, a time that was supposed to be spent outside with friends, family and colleagues celebrating the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.</p>

<p>Such a momentous occasion should have been marked with rallies, parades and parties. Instead, with the COVID-19 pandemic gripping the world, we were all forced indoors in front of our computer screens, wondering what to do next.</p>

<p>So, we improvised.</p>

<p>The result was a fantastic initiative between PennFuture and our partners at <a href=""https://www.conservationpa.org/"">Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania</a>. Called the Act For Our Earth Challenge, participants who signed up for the challenge received one meaningful action in their inbox for each day in April. Most actions only took ten minutes or less, while more involved actions included educational webinars or films.</p>

<p>The challenge was a great success. Over 700 people signed up for the challenge engaging in over 20,000 actions. Throughout the month we aimed to offer a variety of actions in order to find something for everyone. They can broadly be classified as advocacy, voting, education, lifestyle and movement building.</p>

Updated Climate Change Assessment Reveals Future Pennsylvania Water Troubles,4/30/2020,"<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection last week released the state&rsquo;s third <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Energy/Office of Energy and Technology/OETDPortalFiles/ClimateChange/2020ClimateChangeImpactsAssessmentUpdate.pdf"">Climate Change Impacts Assessment</a>, and the update tells us of a warmer future with more rain, floods and landslides than ever experienced in Pennsylvania history.</p>

<p>Heavier and more frequent storms will cause Pennsylvania rivers and streams to swell more frequently. Downstream, greater volumes of sediment will mix with farmland runoff and the pollution-filled stormwater of surrounding cities and towns, exacerbating water concerns for miles and miles.</p>

<p>The impacts will affect our local streams and be noticed far beyond Pennsylvania&rsquo;s borders. Left unchecked and unprepared, the climate crisis will further heighten the difficulty of cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>Challenges will be further intensified if regional agricultural trends continue. The assessment predicts a warmer Pennsylvania climate will attract greater investment in livestock farming across the state. In particular, poultry farming may double by 2050.</p>

<p>Given the unpredictability of severe weather, we must do whatever we can to preparenow. This is no time to back down on long-term <a href=""/what-is-green-stormwater-infrastructure"">investments in green stormwater infrastructure</a> and agricultural best management practices, as well as carbon-reduction policies such as <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fallacy-Fiction-and-Falsehoods-Debunking-RGGI-Myths-Part-1"">the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)</a>.</p>

<p>The dozens of Pennsylvania municipalities <a href=""/Files/Admin/PennFuture_StormwaterManual_web_3.20.17.pdf"">that collect stormwater fees</a> are already better prepared to fund improvements necessary to adapt to climate change and to meet the state&rsquo;s legal obligations under the federal Clean Water Act.</p>

<p>Among those obligations, under <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl"">the EPA&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Program</a>, regional states agree to Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) pollution goals for across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Pennsylvania is committed to prevent 34 million pounds of nitrogen and 756,000 pounds of phosphorus.</p>

<p>To meet the Chesapeake Bay clean-up goals over the coming decades, the assessment anticipates that Pennsylvania will need to exceed annual nitrogen-reduction targets by another 4 million pounds.</p>

<p>Plus, if projected shifts in livestock production were to come true, think of the impact from all that animal manure. In Lancaster County, for example, nitrogen and phosphorous levels are projected to grow by 38% and 58%, respectively.</p>

<p>Not only do we need to better incentivize agricultural practices that lessen water pollution, such as riparian forested buffers and soil health, we must also react to how climate change will affect these practices. To date, research on how climate change will alter their effectiveness is, according to the assessment, &ldquo;essentially nonexistent for Pennsylvania&rdquo;</p>

<p>The release of this year&rsquo;s assessment update, amid the COVID-19 crisis, understandably may be lost amid the news cycle. Still, the warnings should not be overlooked. Even during a time of crisis, we must not lose vision of the challenges lying ahead if we fail to take climate action.</p>

<p>As David Wallace-Wells <a href=""https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/the-coronavirus-is-a-preview-of-our-climate-change-future.html"">writes in New York Magazine</a>, &ldquo;The virus is a terrifying harbinger of future pandemics that will be brought about if climate change continues to so deeply destabilize the natural world: scrambling ecosystems, collapsing habitats, rewiring wildlife, and rewriting the rules that have governed all life on this planet for all of human history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, we need to stay focused.</p>

<p>Recent analysis finds that if the state were to follow Governor Tom Wolf&rsquo;s proposal and join RGGI, such action would allow Pennsylvania to <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Air/AirQuality/AQPortalFiles/Advisory Committees/Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee/2020/4-23-20/RGGI IPM Modeling Webinar.pdf"">reduce nearly 10 times the carbon emissions</a> than anticipated under current policies.</p>

<p>Despite that, leaders of the Pennsylvania Senate Republican Caucus are nonetheless <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/04/23/dep-projects-pa-could-cut-carbon-emissions-dramatically-as-part-of-cap-and-trade-effort/"">asking Wolf to rescind the order</a>, citing the pandemic as their excuse. In addition, certain factions within the General Assembly are in the process of trying to freeze funding that supports local parks, trails, environmental restoration projects, county conservation districts and other projects.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s emergencies do not justify creating more crises for future generations to bear. We must continue to work toward a stable climate. We must continue to prioritize clean water policies, and we must continue to fund programs and projects that protect our natural resources.</p>

<p>Otherwise, with the release of each impact assessment, we will find ourselves with less time to act and with diminished ability to avoid the worse to come.</p>

Fracked Gas and Petrochemical Industries Jockeying for Stimulus Recovery Funds,4/29/2020,"<p>In mid-April, the fracked gas and petrochemical industries&mdash;with the help of a contingent in the U.S. House of Representatives&mdash;<a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/04/22/natural-gas-companies-debt-loan-program-Fed-small-businesses-rate/stories/202004230017"">bombarded the U.S. Treasury Department</a> with letters begging the federal government for help paying back its loans.</p>

<p>Specifically, industry and its boosters want to use a program called the Main Street Lending Program&mdash;which is intended to provide a lifeline to small businesses struggling in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic&mdash;to pay back billions in debts accrued well before the current global health crisis unfolded.</p>

<p>As it currently stands, the government is prohibiting businesses from using these special loans to pay off debt, but an intense lobbying effort by the industry could change that.</p>

<p>Why, in the midst of an economic collapse not seen since the Great Depression, would this industry try to repurpose loans that are needed to keep thousands of small businesses afloat?</p>

<p>Because the industry knows it might collapse without them.</p>

<p>The headlines have been eye-popping. One outlet predicted that <a href=""https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/3/27/experts-see-a-future-for-shale-rocks-don-t-go-bankrupt"">as many as 70 percent</a> of the 6,000 shale drillers in America may go bankrupt in the near future. In late April, the industry <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/negative-oil-prices-what-does-that-mean/"">hit an unprecedented rock bottom</a> as the price for futures contracts went below zero for the first time ever.</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/energy-environment/pennsylvania-shale-gas-fracking.html"">the New York Times reported</a> in late March, some of the largest fracking companies in Pennsylvania&mdash;among them Range Resources, EQT and Southwestern Energy&mdash;have seen their stocks plummet and debts increase by a combined $7 billion since 2008.</p>

<p>Even Shell, the global behemoth that is building an ethane cracker plant in Beaver County, has seen its share prices drop by nearly half this year and <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lng-shell/shell-drops-out-of-major-u-s-lng-project-energy-transfer-delays-decision-idUSKBN21H2E9"">has stated its intent to pull out</a> of a major Liquified Natural gas project in Louisiana, citing market conditions.</p>

<p>The industry is facing more than $200 billion in corporate debt, and <a href=""https://www.ciel.org/news/pandemic-crisis-systemic-decline-new-report-warns-oil-gas-and-plastic-industries-are-an-unfillable-sinkhole-for-recovery-funds/"">one study published on April 16</a> warns of the dangers of dumping stimulus money into an industry that was already facing &ldquo;profound and pervasive risks&rdquo; before the pandemic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoveling money at the oil, gas, and petrochemical industries will not change the fundamental weaknesses they faced before this crisis began and will face moving forward,&rdquo; said report co-author Steven Feit.</p>

<p>That report makes clear an uncomfortable truth facing the industry: the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is accelerating its rapid decline, but it is not the sole cause or reason for the decline.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exceedingly clear that this industry was on shaky financial footing even before the current pandemic upended our economy. Coronavirus isn&rsquo;t the culprit behind poor money management, declining revenues and inherent weaknesses that have plagued the industry. It wasn&rsquo;t a global public health crisis that made the financial sector deeply wary and skeptical of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the chief executive officer of a Texas-based oil and gas exploration company <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/04/22/natural-gas-companies-debt-loan-program-Fed-small-businesses-rate/stories/202004230017"">who was quoted recently in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a> as saying &ldquo;no one wants to give (the industry) capital because we have all destroyed capital and created economic waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why, then, would the federal government&mdash;or any other government, financial institution, or other entity&mdash;be enticed to offer billions of dollars in bailouts to an industry that has consistently and routinely &ldquo;destroyed capital and created economic waste&rdquo; well before the current pandemic?</p>

<p>Carroll Muffett, the president of CIEL&mdash;the organization <a href=""https://www.ciel.org/news/pandemic-crisis-systemic-decline-new-report-warns-oil-gas-and-plastic-industries-are-an-unfillable-sinkhole-for-recovery-funds/"">that published the study</a> warning against dumping stimulus money into this failing industry&mdash;said it best by adding that there&rsquo;s &ldquo;overwhelming evidence that this sector has reached its end game,&rdquo; and that it did so even before coronavirus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No amount of government intervention or taxpayer money can save these companies in the long term unless they fundamentally transform their business models. For governments to continue dumping money into these industries is throwing money down a hole at a time when every moment and every dollar needs to be used effectively for the greatest possible public good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For fossil fuels, the writing was sprawled across the wall well before current events took hold, and the industry should not try to parlay the coronavirus into an undeserved, irresponsible and reckless attempt at a bailout.</p>

PennFuture taking holistic view of improving water quality around Philadelphia,4/28/2020,"<p>Last week, the Delaware River <a href=""/Blog-Item-Congratulations-to-the-Delaware-River"">was named the 2020 national &ldquo;River of the Year&rdquo;</a> by American Rivers. This honor recognizes the dramatic improvement of the Delaware River&rsquo;s water quality, which the organization credited to intergovernmental collaboration and effective environmental enforcement, coupled with innovative local water management.</p>

<p>Fish have returned to the urbanized portions of the river and the community is once again thinking of the lower Delaware River as a place of recreation!</p>

<p>PennFuture is happy to be part of that push for better water quality over the past several decades, especially in the Philadelphia region of the Delaware River Watershed, where we&rsquo;ve been advocating for a variety of ways to improve the water.</p>

<p>For example, our <a href=""/Blog-Category-KeepPhillyGreen"">Keep Philly Green &amp; Water Clean campaign</a> has been focusing on increasing green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) in the city. Philadelphia is increasing the use of GSI &ndash; such as rain gardens, tree trenches, and green roofs &ndash; through its Green City, Clean Waters program, which reduces the amount of polluted stormwater that enters the Delaware River and its tributaries through Philadelphia&rsquo;s combined sewer overflow (CSO) system. GSI has the added benefit of providing local communities with local jobs, cleaner air, more attractive parks, and streets, and an overall healthier community.</p>

<p>In 2018, <a href=""/Blog-Item-Philadelphias-Green-City-Clean-Waters-Needs-Funding-to-Achieve-Goals"">PennFuture submitted comments</a> in support of Philadelphia&rsquo;s Green City, Clean Waters program in which we detailed the importance of funding and grant incentive programs to achieve Philadelphia&rsquo;s GSI plan. In 2019, <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Opportunity-for-Green-Stormwater-Infrastructure-in-Philadelphias-Rebuild-Initiative"">we advocated for Philadelphia to combine</a> its GSI plan with the Rebuild Community Infrastructure (Rebuild) Initiative and petitioned the Philadelphia City Council to prioritize green stormwater infrastructure.</p>

<p>For the past two years in the fall, <a href=""/Blog-Item-Philly-GSI-Bus-tour"">PennFuture organizedbus tours</a> with members of City Council aimed at highlighting the social, economic, and environmental benefits of GSI in Philadelphia. Earlier this month, <a href=""/Blog-Item-Philly-Can-Achieve-a-Green-New-Deal-through-Green-Stormwater-Infrastructure"">PennFuture advocated for a Green New Deal</a> for Philadelphia through an emphasis on GSI projects which create jobs, improve our local communities, and increase community resiliency against the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>PennFuture is a proud supporter of Green City, Clean Waters and the work that the Philadelphia Water Department does to increase GSI and address pollution into the Delaware River while improving Philadelphia&rsquo;s communities. A cleaner Delaware River means we can all enjoy its benefits &ndash; drinking, fishing, and recreating!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why in March 2020, <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Petitions-DRBC-to-Recognize-Primary-Contact-Recreation-on-the-Mainstem-Delaware-River"">PennFuture and others petitioned the Delaware River Basin Commission</a> to upgrade the designated use of a portion of the lower Delaware River to reflect the community&rsquo;s use of the River for primary contact recreation sports.</p>

<p>And in late April, PennFuture joined with our partner organizations to educate conservation groups and community members about our <a href=""/Files/Admin/3.2.2020-Primary-Contact-PR---Petition.pdf"">&ldquo;Petition for a Safe and Healthy Delaware River.&rdquo;</a> This petition asks for the Delaware River Basin Commission to recognize what American Rivers and others have: that the lower Delaware River has improved and that people are using it for swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, jet skiing, and other water sports that put community members in the river.</p>

<p>But now we need your support of our petition. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKiNCkEg_QcEEHqSBhUwbhQiJjgzaKQX5UhAramPQO7nE8aA/viewform"">Share your story of how you recreate</a> on the lower Delaware River. Sign on to our petition &ndash; <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccmsyRjHIRemMq24UQVqGwpL7IYz1s4NsfFXnqpz4F9yd1sw/viewform"">whether you&rsquo;re a conservation organization</a> or a <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/supportdelawarepetition"">concerned community member</a>. Your stories matter to the health of the Delaware!</p>

<p>We know that there are many different ways to protect water quality, and in the Philadelphia region, PennFuture has been utilizing many of our legal and advocacy tools to achieve a holistic vision for improvement of the water quality of the lower Delaware River watershed!</p>

<p>We have fought hard to stop polluters and to find innovative ways to improve water quality of the Delaware River, and now we&rsquo;re advocating to protect the advances we&rsquo;ve made over the years.<br />

Model shows participation in RGGI would reduce pollution by 180 million tons,4/27/2020,"<p>On April 24, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) held a joint web conference to present <a href=""https://www.icf.com"">recent modeling completed by ICF</a> on the potential impact of Governor Wolf&rsquo;s plan to implement a cap-and-invest program in cooperation with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).</p>

<p>The results show the plan marks a significant step toward reaching our carbon pollution goals by saving 180 million tons of carbon pollution while maintaining Pennsylvanias status as a significant energy generator and exporter.</p>

<p>While this is great news on its own, ICF focused its modeling on the impacts of putting a cap on carbon admissions. The RGGI program also has an &ldquo;invest&rdquo; component where we can see even more benefits, but those weren&rsquo;t modeled. When Abt Associates <a href=""https://www.abtassociates.com/insights/publications/report/analysis-of-the-public-health-impacts-of-the-regional-greenhouse-gas"">looked into these broader impacts</a> seen in the other RGGI states they found it saved hundreds of lives, tens of thousands of hours of lost work, led to strong net job creation, and resulted in an overall total of $5.7 billion dollars in benefits.</p>

<p>Of course, no matter the benefits, you can&rsquo;t talk about reducing carbon pollution without generating attacks from polluters and their friends.</p>

<p>One of their top-line arguments is that RGGI is going to kill coal. As we&rsquo;ve said before, coal generation in Pennsylvania is already on its last legs without RGGI&mdash;it went from 47 percent of our generation in 2010 to just 17 percent last year, and ICF predicts it will continue to drop to just 3 percent of our generation by 2030 even without RGGI.</p>

<p>This is not surprising since there are few remaining large coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania, all of them are rapidly approaching retirement, and no one is planning to build new plants. When RGGI is added to the mix, coal retirement speeds up a little bit to just over 1 percent of our generation by 2030. With RGGI making less than a 2 percent difference in overall coal generation, it&rsquo;s clear whatever problems the industry is facing, it is not RGGI that is killing coal.</p>

<p>The next line of attack is asserting that RGGI will raise prices. It&rsquo;s true that ICF&rsquo;s modeling shows a slight increase in energy prices by 1.1 tenths of a cent a kilowatt-hour over business-as-usual. While this works out to less than $1 per month on the average household bill, when adjusted for inflation energy prices are predicted to be lower with RGGI than they are today.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that there is a big difference between the price of energy and what consumers actually pay. If gas prices go up, people respond by driving less or buying a car with better gas mileage&mdash;the same thing happens with your electric bill. Consumers can invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy to reduce their bills. Better still, the fees generated by the RGGI program can go into programs that make those investments even cheaper, and this wasn&rsquo;t considered in the ICF modeling.</p>

<p>The last big attack comes in a lot of different forms, but it&rsquo;s that RGGI isn&rsquo;t going to fix the climate change crisis on its own, so it&rsquo;s not worth doing at all. Any elementary school student would probably realize that saying &ldquo;other people litter, so why not throw my trash out the window too?&rdquo; is a cop-out.</p>

<p>We all have a responsibility to act but Pennsylvania, as a huge source of the emissions that created the crisis, may have a greater responsibility than others to solve the problem. The investments and actions we take today will have long-lasting impacts well beyond 2030 and play a significant role in meeting our climate goals.</p>

<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us to avoid the worst effects of climate change we need to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. With electric generation being the largest source of carbon pollution in Pennsylvania, it&rsquo;s clear that we are not going to reach that goal, or even the lesser Paris goals, without doing all we can.</p>

<p>Failing to adopt the RGGI program means that we need to find a way to reduce 180 million extra tons of carbon pollution from some other source, and it&rsquo;s very likely that source isn&rsquo;t going to provide over a billion dollars in net benefits as we would see from RGGI.</p>

<p>These are not the last of the attacks we are going to see. Representatives from DEP did a great job at the briefing responding to these attacks, but as we go forward they are going to increase in frequency and intensity.</p>

<p>Be sure that PennFuture will be there every step of the way, pushing back against fallacies and mistruths, and doing what we can to keep you educated, informed and engaged with this long process.</p>

Earth Day 2070,4/21/2020,"<p>I truly believed this week, Earth Week, could be a magical one, when the world would come together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the first Earth Day.</p>

<p>Many months ago, when I began thinking about how we would be marking this momentous anniversary, I envisioned everything that happened in 1970 on behalf of &ldquo;Mother Earth.&rdquo;The decade of the anti-establishment 1960&rsquo;s actually peaked in 1970. Millions of people were in the streets in peaceful and turbulent protest; colleges students mounted teach-ins or occupied administration buildings; multiple generations were caught in the mod fashion of the day but they were also turned onto activism and issues. Earth Day 1970 and the &ldquo;ecology movement&rdquo; lead to a suite of sweeping legislation to protect our environment.</p>

<p>Last summer, it seemed reasonable to think that on Earth Day 2020 in the midst of the existential climate crisis, the people of our earth would want to gather with even more urgency and turn out in bigger numbers than 1970 to change the condition of our planet&mdash;a planet besieged by anti-environmental policymakers, dark money billionaires and our own unsustainable lifestyles.Earth Day 2020 could be a catalyst to: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Energize the myriad of people across the globe who are experiencing climate impacts who care deeply about addressing the climate crisis, who want to do something about it but don&rsquo;t know how; </li>
	<li>Give birth to a new environmental movement&mdash;one that reorients itself to not only climate matters, but to the concerns of so many diverse and underserved communities who are dealing also with impacts from chronic pollution and other forms of environmental degradation;</li>
	<li>Raise up our youth climate strikers, and their courage and persistence; and</li>
	<li>Mobilize caring citizens everywhere into an unstoppable political force to once and for all change the politics, in order to change the fate of our common climate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can COVID-19 take this dream away? It sure has put a dent into the tactic of turning out great numbers of people, in public, demonstrating against climate inaction, demanding accountability of elected officials and celebrating climate solidarity.</p>

<p>But COVID-19 has not taken away our common humanity, interconnectedness, and reliance upon planetary health as foundational to our personal safety and well-being. If anything, this pandemic puts a finer point on these attributes. And, grimly, this public health emergency has deepened the disparities between underserved individuals and communities of color, and their ability to survive this deadly pandemic.</p>

<p>My hat is off to the organizations and activists everywhere that have quickly retooled plans for Earth Day 2020, including PennFuture and Conservation Voters of PA&rsquo;s 30-Day Earth Challenge, and the Pittsburgh Earth Week Teach-In and 24-hour Climate Strike.</p>

<p>And while digital platforms are uniting us, I propose three actions&mdash;more surgical in nature&mdash;to ensure this momentous Earth Day does not come and go with only a whimper or sound tone from our smart phone:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Run for Office. Nothing will change our political system faster than a new crop of climate-forward candidates. Once elected, you can effect real change. And the threat of an onslaught of challengers will threaten incumbent elected officials who have grown stagnant, entrenched in a broken system and to the influence of political action money;</li>
	<li>Vote. Make sure you are registered to vote, and that you actually vote. And make sure that everyone you know who is eligible to vote, is registered to vote, and that they actually vote. Here is everything you need to know about voting in Pennsylvania in 2020.</li>
	<li>Contact your elected officials and demand they declare a climate emergency for their respective jurisdictions. Request they develop a climate change action and response plan. Contact Governor Wolf and request that funds for this local climate planning&mdash;and implementation of existing climate action plans and projects&mdash;are included in any stimulus or economic recovery package that emerges as a result of the pandemic.</li>
</ol>

<p>Come with me to the date April 22, 2070&mdash;now the 100th anniversary of the first Earth Day.Will our Earth Week 2020 be one in which we found a way to rise up and break out, and break through the walls of our respective isolations, and despite the oppression of the pandemic, to find a way to recommit to the fight to save our planet, and our futures?</p>

Congratulations to the Delaware River!,4/20/2020,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">The resurgence of the Delaware River has received well-deserved recognition. Beating out river basins all across the United States, the Delaware was named River of the Year for 2020 by national environmental group American Rivers.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">With much of Eastern Pennsylvania flowing into the Delaware watershed, PennFuture takes seriously our charge as a clean water watchdog for the river. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Our legal team and community organizers defend the Delaware against illegal polluters and from efforts to undermine legal protections. As award-worthy as the Delaware is today, we take nothing for granted, continuously advocating for greater progress.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The source of drinking water for 13.3million people, the Delaware is now relied upon as a clean water resource. But, 50 years back, the water quality we enjoy today was nearly unimaginable. Polluters recklessly dumped raw sewage and chemicals straight into the river, making it near impossible to sustain even the most basic forms of aquatic life.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;The quality of water in the Delaware has dramatically improved, fish and wildlife have returned in tremendous numbers, and the mainstem of the Delaware remains the longest free-flowing river in the eastern U.S., with the most extensive National Wild and Scenic River protection of any watershed in the country,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.americanrivers.org/2020/04/river-of-the-year-for-2020-the-delaware-river/"">writes American Rivers</a> VP of Communications Amy Souers Kober. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">American Rivers credits the revitalization to intergovernmental collaboration and effective environmental enforcement, coupled with innovative local water management. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">PennFuture is proud of the role our volunteers and campaign staff have played in leading these efforts. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">For example, PennFuture is a lead convener for groups such as <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.org/"">Our Pocono Waters</a>, a coalition of businesses and conservationists advocating for protection of the Exceptional Value headwaters of the Delaware. <a href=""/Publication-PennFuture-and-Brodhead-Watershed-Association-Earn-Legal-Victory-for-Exceptional-Value-Streams-in-the-Poconos"">A recent campaign successfully thwarted</a> well-heeled owners of resorts and other large developments from weakening regional stream protections.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>PennFuture also holds the state lead seat for the Coalition of the Delaware River Watershed, a four-state coalition made up of over 150 members nongovernmental organizations. This coalition is dedicated to &ldquo;protecting and restoring the Delaware River, its tributaries, and more than 13,500 square miles of forests, wetlands, communities, and other distinctive landscapes in the Watershed, so that clean water and valued resources can be here for generations to come.&rdquo;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Last month, PennFuture attorneys <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Petitions-DRBC-to-Recognize-Primary-Contact-Recreation-on-the-Mainstem-Delaware-River"">co-led a draft petition to upgrade water quality standards for a portion of the Delaware River</a>. The petition demands regulators ensure the safety of all who engage in direct contact recreation &ndash; such as jet skiing and kayaking, swimming, stand-up paddleboarding and tubing. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In addition to advocacy work across the watershed, PennFuture keeps watch on individual polluters. Earlier this year, PennFuture placed two Philadelphia scrap metal facilities on notice for operating without necessary stormwater pollution controls. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">When scrap metal contacts with stormwater, pollutants such as motor oil, grease, lead, chromium, cadmium, copper, mercury and zinc may flow into the Delaware River. Our actions are deterring scrap yards and other industrial facilities who may otherwise operate with inadequate pollution control measures.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Let&rsquo;s continue to celebrate and protect the Delaware River. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Throughout the year, we will pair volunteers with their elected officials, educating leaders on the benefits of clean streams. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/ourpoconowaters/index.html"">Join us</a> to help ensure the steady flow of clean water progress. <o:p></o:p></p>

"PennFuture, partners to celebrate PA Clean Water Week",4/13/2020,"<p>The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has fundamentally changed most aspects of our lives in the last several months, but one thing that&rsquo;s changed for the positive is our connection to nature and the outdoors.</p>

<p>Here at PennFuture, we&rsquo;ve always taken seriously the need to appreciate Pennsylvania&rsquo;s natural resources, which is why we do everything we can to protect and preserve them. Part of that work, however, involves highlighting all of our beautiful streams, rivers and waterways throughout Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why this week, in conjunction with groups like the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed and the Choose Clean Water Coalition, we are officially celebrating the first ever &ldquo;PA Clean Water Week.&rdquo; During this period, we are celebrating not only the waters of Pennsylvania, but advocating for their preservation and health, and for funding from our state and federal governments for restoration and maintenance projects.</p>

<p>Each day this week, we will feature a different watershed in Pennsylvania and will use social media like Facebook and Twitter to communicate with supporters.</p>

<p>On Monday, April 13, we will celebrate the Delaware River watershed. On Tuesday, we will highlight the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which includes the Susquehanna &amp; Potomac Rivers. Wednesday will include a celebration of the Ohio River watershed, which includes the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers. Thursday will include a celebration of the Lake Erie and Genesee River watersheds. Friday will wrap up PA Clean Water Week with a virtual webinar to celebrate all of these wonderful watersheds!</p>

<p>Every day of the week, you can celebrate Pennsylvania&rsquo;s streams and rivers by sharing photos of your local waterways, posting a short video on why clean water matters to you, writing a poem or short story, or posting on social media. Please be sure to tag PennFuture on both Facebook and Twitter or use the hashtag #PaCleanWaterWeek, so we can share your contributions during the celebration webinar on Friday, April 17!</p>

Five Environmental Consequences of the Covid-19 Pandemic for Pennsylvania,4/8/2020,"<div>The environmental, economic, and social impacts of Covid-19 are profound and are reshaping how we work, recreate, and live our daily lives. While the impacts of this crisis will continue to shift and grow with each passing week, a number of critical environmental observations relevant to Pennsylvania are becoming clearer:</div>

<div></div>

<p><strong>1. The importance of our outdoor and green spaces is vital now more than ever.</strong> Governor Tom Wolf issued a &ldquo;stay-at-home&rdquo; order to compel citizens across the Commonwealth to limit their daily interactions with others to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The order allowed engaging in outdoor activities as long as safe social distancing guidelines were followed. Pennsylvanians have responded by visiting their state parks, state forest lands, and municipal parks <a href=""https://www.fox43.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/pa-dcnr-shares-guidelines-for-those-who-want-to-spend-time-outdoors-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/521-239d4182-88e9-4827-b5f9-4fcaf7393e69"">in record numbers</a>. The opening of trout season <a href=""https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/fish-and-Boat-Commission-Details.aspx?newsid=316"">was pushed up by a week</a> to provide anglers more access to fish stocked streams. Whether for exercise, taking in the warm weather, getting our children outside, or wholesome recreation, it&rsquo;s clear that connecting&mdash;or for many re-connecting&mdash;with the historic trails, forests, streams, and lakes of Pennsylvania has been an important escape from the pandemic. The health crisis is re-teaching us how important our green spaces&mdash;and by extension the conservation of these special places&mdash;are to our mental and physical wellbeing. While for terrible reasons, new and old generations of hikers, anglers, birders, walkers, boaters, hunters, and runners are experiencing the state&rsquo;s natural beauty, which could have long term positive impact on the use and conservation of our public lands.</p>

<p><strong>2. Covid-19 is exacerbating the equity and justice gap between communities impacted by pollution and those that are not.</strong> Much reporting has been done on how the pandemic is impacting people differently. While blue collar workers are filing for unemployment, poor, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/coronavirus-race.html"">immigrant</a>, and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/coronavirus-race.html"">black and brown neighborhoods</a> are experiencing <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coronavirus-and-inequality-meet-in-detroit"">higher levels of infection</a> and death than those that are more affluent. The pandemic is not necessarily an equal opportunist as its consequences are being felt more acutely by those without access to healthcare, those who can&rsquo;t work from home, and those with underlying health and morbidity conditions, such as those <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/climate/air-pollution-coronavirus-covid.html"">caused by chronic pollution</a>. According to new research from Harvard University, Covid-19 patients in areas with high levels of air pollution had a higher likelihood of death. Chronic air pollution from traffic, factories, and fossil fuel power plants cause more cases of asthma, lung disease, and cardiovascular disease that, when combined with severe lung inflammation caused by Covid-19, is often fatal. It brings into clear view the long-term damage caused by chronic pollution to our environmental justice communities and how reducing pollution should now more than ever be a top public health priority.</p>

<p><strong>3. The Commonwealth&rsquo;s boom-and-bust fossil fuel economy is unsustainable.</strong> Even before the pandemic, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fossil fuel economy was on its heels. Oil and gas company stock prices are down 60 percent this year irrespective of the pandemic and companies <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/business/energy-environment/coronavirus-oil-companies-debt.html"">are now drastically cutting</a> project costs and their workforce. <a href=""https://www.industryweek.com/supply-chain/planning-forecasting/article/21125045/covid19-is-coming-for-the-chemical-industry-in-2020-basf-frets"">Petrochemical companies worry</a> that Covid-19 will result in yet another year of falling profits and production. And any recession caused by the Covid-19 crisis <a href=""https://grist.org/beacon/covid-is-killing-coal/"">could mark the end</a> of already struggling coal plants and coal mines. In other words, the pandemic is laying bare an unfortunate truth many already know&mdash;the Commonwealth&rsquo;s fossil fuel industry has no clothes. The economic hopes hung around fracked gas, petrochemical facilities, and coal plants are a boom-and-bust mirage. It&rsquo;s what makes the state legislature&rsquo;s <a href=""/Blog-Item-Why-Does-Pennsylvania-Insist-on-Offering-Subsidies-to-Fracked-Gas-and-Petrochemicals-The-Industries-Would-Collapse-Without-Them"">attempts to provide billions</a> in taxpayer subsidies to the petrochemical industry even more unsettling. It puts into question why the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) would want to provide waste coal plants <a href=""/Blog-Item-DEP-is-Asking-Us-to-Pick-Up-the-Bill-for-Waste-CoalAgain"">yet another subsidy</a>. And it is inconceivable why the state Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) has made supporting a natural gas and plastics buildout <a href=""https://dced.pa.gov/key-industries/"">its top economic priority</a>. It&rsquo;s clear that Pennsylvania needs a new economic development strategy that doesn&rsquo;t rely on fossil fuels because our reliance on that industry is destroying not only the health of our communities, but their opportunity for long term, sustainable prosperity.</p>

<p><strong>4. The anti-environmental movement continues to advance even during a public health crisis. </strong>While the rest of the country and Commonwealth is focused on their safety and health during the Covid-19 crisis, the anti-environmental movement continues to advance its agenda. The Trump Administration made a stunning announcement <a href=""/Publication-PennFuture-urges-DEP-to-continue-enforcement-during-pandemic"">to suspend enforcement</a> of environmental and public health rules during the pandemic. The EPA is <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-eases-emissions-rules-make-cars-safer-but-ignores-facts-2020-4"">finalizing a rollback</a> of fuel efficiency standards that the car manufacturers originally helped write and celebrated. The Pennsylvania Senate waited until the health crisis was in full swing <a href=""/News-PennFuture-reacts-to-House-Bill-1100-being-sent-to-Gov-Wolf"">to send to the Governor House Bill 1100</a>, which would have provided open-ended subsidies for petrochemical plants (he vetoed it). And right now, a group of state legislators <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2020/04/analysis-conservative-republicans.html"">are pushing legislation</a> to strip funds from environmental programs that conserve public land (see #1) <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2020/04/republicans-on-house-committee-report.html"">as well as limit environmental protections</a>. These efforts unveil how little regard the anti-environmental movement has for conservation, public health, and sustainable communities.</p>

<p><strong>5. Post-Covid-19, the Commonwealth has a generational opportunity to reshape the economy toward sustainable economic development.</strong> I&rsquo;m an eternal optimist. Pennsylvania will make it through this health crisis. A new normal will set in, but our policymakers will need to get to work to restart the economy. The federal government already passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus to provide a 2-month bridge for workers and businesses and they already know that isn&rsquo;t enough to make it through the economic recession we&rsquo;re settling into. Federal, state, and municipal governments will need to enact a series of stimulus and economic recovery packages to get us through the economic inactivity caused by the crisis and then get everyone back to work. But it&rsquo;s clear we can&rsquo;t just restart what we were doing pre-pandemic for the reasons described above. The Commonwealth&rsquo;s economy was already on unsettled ground and throwing more money at unsustainable fossil fuel businesses puts our communities back in the same fear of boom-and-bust industries and fear of pollution impacts. Policymakers needs to get this right and invest in sustainable, shovel-ready projects that provide family-sustaining wages as well as invest in industries that create jobs without harming our air, water, land, and climate. This crisis should be a wake-up call to get moving on a stronger, better, more sustainable economy.</p>

Philly Can Achieve a Green New Deal through Green Stormwater Infrastructure,4/1/2020,"

<p>Since the coronavirus pandemic hit Philadelphia, nearly half a million people have filed for unemployment, and that number will continue to rise. Nationwide the number of people who&rsquo;ve filed for unemployment has reached 6.6 million. We&rsquo;re observing a great depression in the making that will extend long after the pandemic crisis is over.</p>

<p>Last month, a group of climate and social experts in academia and civil society <a href=""https://medium.com/@green_stimulus_now"">released a letter laying out</a> a green stimulus proposal and called on the federal government to take action, a more robust policy plan to the Green New Deal resolution introduced by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and U.S. Sen. Ed Markey (D., M.A.).</p>

<p>Philadelphia should develop the institutional infrastructure now to prepare for a Green Stimulus package, while at the same time calling on the federal government to pass a medium-term stimulus package that invests in communities, workforce development, and protecting natural resources.</p>

<p>Despite an increase in jobs over the past ten years, Philadelphia has offered too few upward mobility pathways for residents in search of family-sustaining jobs. Of all jobs created since 2009, only 26 percent are in sectors paying more than $35,000 per year.</p>

<p>To achieve clean energy, clean water and community resiliency goals, a Green Stimulus promises to unleash millions in infrastructure investments that would produce thousands of dignified, high-wage jobs and stimulate the economy. These include construction and maintenance opportunities that reduce water pollution across the region.</p>

<p>The city&rsquo;s elected leaders are already advancing some of the climate change and economic policies described in the Green Stimulus letter. Among newly inaugurated City Council members, 11 of 17 members support creating a local Green New Deal, per a survey PennFuture conducted with other groups.</p>

<p>Yet Philly&rsquo;s largest green jobs initiative does not receive enough attention. To lay the groundwork for a local Green Stimulus, we need to refocus attention on the Philadelphia Water Department. The Philadelphia Water Department and its related operations employs thousands of Philadelphians. <a href=""/about-philadelphia-water-dept-green-city"">The Green City, Clean Waters program</a> is one of those programs, which is creating jobs and taking PWD into the water utility of the future green economy.</p>

<p>Green City, Clean Waters funds public and private projects across the city that filter stormwater through rocks, soil and plants, limiting the release of pollution into regional waterways caused by sewer system overflows. Beyond cleaner water, these green stormwater infrastructure projects create jobs, improve our local economy and prepare our communities for the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>To maximize the workforce-redevelopment potential of Green City, Clean Waters, Philly leadership needs to renew the city&rsquo;s dedication to the program. By addressing current barriers to green stormwater infrastructure, including obstacles within city-led programs such as Rebuild, we can address our water pollution challenges while producing hundreds of new jobs.</p>

<p><strong>From Factory Jobs to Stormwater Careers</strong></p>

<p>After losing 263,000 jobs from 1970 to 2010, Philly <a href=""https://www.centercityphila.org/uploads/attachments/ck24wk9av08l08lqdv2nmwekd-19-jobs-report-web-update.pdf"">had recently been adding jobs</a> at a faster rate than the country&rsquo;s 25 largest cities.</p>

<p>That said, as of 2018, the city still offered 23,000 fewer jobs compared to 1990. This is despite a 69,000-person increase in <a href=""https://www.philaworks.org/philadelphias-population/"">&ldquo;prime working age&rdquo;</a> residents over the same period. And the new jobs were mostly for entry-level work&mdash; most have been in sectors that pay on average $35,000 or less.</p>

<p>The rise in predominantly low-wage jobs contrasts with the opportunities available designing, installing or maintaining green stormwater infrastructure. <a href=""https://gsipartners.sbnphiladelphia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBN_FINAL-REPORT.pdf"">A 2016 study estimates</a> Green City, Clean Waters then supported 430 local jobs and $27 million in annual labor income. Over its 20-year period, the program has been forecasted to produce 1,000 jobs per year.</p>

<p>Such work is generally accessible, well-paying and protected, with many employees offered meaningful advancement opportunities.</p>

<p>Green stormwater infrastructure operations and maintenance jobs typically require a high school diploma or less. Workers earning entry-level wages are, in all likelihood, collecting near minimum wage. But once workers are trained and experienced, they often receive higher wages as they transition from entry-level jobs to roles that require more training and certification. <a href=""https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/greenforall/pages/1562/attachments/original/1412187831/Staying-Green-and-Growing-Jobs-April-2013.pdf.pdf?1412187831"">National data suggests</a> work experience, a high school diploma and additional job-related course work can offer wages upward of $20 per hour.</p>

<p>Workers involved in public projects are even more likely to earn living wages and benefits. Unionization rates in green stormwater infrastructure occupations are likely higher than the nationwide rate of 10 percent. Examples of high union representation among green stormwater infrastructure roles include jobs within the plumbing (20 percent), construction (18.5 percent) and landscape maintenance (15 percent) trades.</p>

<p><strong>Unlock More Green Stormwater Infrastructure Work</strong></p>

<p>As Philadelphia City Council&rsquo;s environmental leaders discuss what a Green Stimulus means for the city, their legislative agendas must start by addressing current barriers to implementing Green City Clean Waters, including within other city programs such as the <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/programs/rebuild/project-sites/"">Rebuild Community Infrastructure Initiative.</a></p>

<p>Through Rebuild, Philly continues to break ground on much-needed renovation of parks, recreation centers and libraries. At PennFuture, <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Opportunity-for-Green-Stormwater-Infrastructure-in-Philadelphias-Rebuild-Initiative"">we have advocated that Philadelphia leaders</a> combine the goals of Green City, Clean Waters and Rebuild. In doing so, Philadelphia can align two major infrastructure investments and multiply the workforce development impact of these important programs.</p>

<p>In 2020, <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/2020-01-17-14-rebuild-projects-to-get-excited-about-in-2020/"">Rebuild is set to break ground</a> at six refurbished playgrounds. Green stormwater infrastructure does not currently appear to be included in any of these projects.</p>

<p>Green jobs attract a diverse workforce. Including more green stormwater infrastructure projects within Philadelphia&rsquo;s capital improvements could be a means to increase minority participation.</p>

<p>Rebuild, once estimated to reach $500 million in spending, pledged to award at least a third of construction contracts and a quarter of professional services contracts to minority- and women-owned firms. So far, <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WBSxQ_1OGEXdIA7fPeHA2Mn6wRhxXHX_/view"">less than 28 percent</a> of Rebuild construction contracts and 24 percent of professional services have been allocated toward minority-owned firms.</p>

<p>A study of <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/2019-06-06-office-of-economic-opportunity-releases-fy18-disparity-study/"">Fiscal Year 2018 contracts</a> found minority-owned firms were included on $1.45 billion of city-issued and quasi-public contracts. About 30 percent of this spending went directly to minority-owned firms, a slight decrease from FY17 and short of the city&rsquo;s 35 percent goal.</p>

<p><strong>Our Message to City Council</strong></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not stop at Rebuild. Philly should require consideration of green stormwater infrastructure in every public capital project &mdash; just like developers must now install green stormwater infrastructure in larger new construction projects.</p>

<p>From school playgrounds and recreation center ballfields to streets and sidewalks, we need city leadership to join together and share responsibility for these stormwater initiatives. That includes funding a Clean Water Act Task Force coordinator position within the Managing Director&rsquo;s Office to develop a strategic plan that addresses interagency coordination.</p>

<p>Finally, to invest in jobs and infrastructure to address climate change, city leaders should call on PWD to plan for sustainable funding for GSI maintenance to ensure long-term success of green stormwater infrastructure.</p>

<p>If we take the Green New Deal seriously, green stormwater infrastructure is an opportunity for City Council to rise to the challenge and to transform Philadelphia&rsquo;s economy while creating jobs, protecting clean water and building climate resilience.</p>

DEP is Asking Us to Pick Up the Bill for Waste Coal...Again,3/23/2020,"<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-First-Glimpse-PennFuture-analyzes-draft-of-DEPs-cap-and-invest-program"">developing a CO2 trading program</a> compatible with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-First-Glimpse-PennFuture-analyzes-draft-of-DEPs-cap-and-invest-program"">first draft of the program</a> would establish a state-wide cap on carbon emissions and require generators of electricity with a rated capacity of at least 25 megawatts (MW) to obtain allowances for each ton of CO2 they emit. Under the RGGI program, most of these allowances will be obtained through an auction, but it also allows a certain number of credits to be <a href=""https://www.rggi.org/sites/default/files/Uploads/Allowance-Tracking/States_Set-Aside_Accounts.pdf"">set aside for special purposes</a>. This provides for policy flexibility, but also opens the door to bad decisions that will limit carbon reductions.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet=""""><u><strong>The Proposed Waste Coal Set Aside</strong></u></p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">DEP is proposing one set aside&mdash;reserving 7.9 million tons worth of allowances to be given away for free to electric generators that burn low-quality coal that mining companies dumped in huge piles all over the state&rsquo;s mining regions and left communities to deal with its hazards.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Pennsylvania has hundreds of millions of tons of waste coal piles and some have been leaching pollution into our streams and rivers for over a hundred years&mdash;in the worst cases, these piles can catch on fire and pollute the air as well. The companies that caused this pollution have often long-since gone out of business so, if the waste is going to be cleaned up, the state will either need to appropriate the funds to pay for it or find some other solution.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Digging up this coal and transferring it to appropriately-sited and designed disposal facilities is an expensive proposition. In some cases, it&rsquo;s possible to stabilize the piles in place by planting beach grass or other vegetation; that is much cheaper but it would still require the state to appropriate clean-up funds. Compared to paying for cleanup, it&rsquo;s not surprising our leaders see burning this waste in power plants as an acceptable alternative.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">While new technology makes it possible to use this fuel in power plants, it&rsquo;s still a low-quality fuel. This means that waste coal plants tend to produce more air pollution than most other types of generation. In fact, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waste coal plants are up to thirty percent more carbon polluting than some conventional coal plants and more than twice as carbon polluting as natural gas plants. By choosing to burn this waste, we are trading pollution of our land and water for increased emissions of air toxins, greenhouse gases, and other pollutants.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Proponents of waste coal argue that the environmental and public health benefits of cleaning up the waste piles more than make up for the added air pollution. Whether or not that is true in any particular case is not only a difficult technical problem, it&rsquo;s also a challenging ethical issue&mdash;for all the benefits on one end, someone else will be paying the price with adverse health impacts. We all support clean water and pristine landscapes, but is it fair for the most vulnerable to be asked to pay the price?</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">By and large, our leaders don&rsquo;t appear to have spent a lot of time worrying about the ethics or the technical details. Leaching waste coal piles are obvious sources of pollution everyone in the community can see, whereas air pollution is often invisible and the health impacts happen miles away and maybe years later, making it easier to ignore.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Proponents also argue that waste coal is a good financial deal for the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s far from true and their need for consistent taxpayer subsidies, even though waste coal is a mature technology, is proof enough. The fact that this is low-quality fuel means the plants that burn it have difficulty competing with more efficient generation and are constantly on the lookout for subsidies that help them remain profitable. The federal government effectively built this industry through subsidies resulting from the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) which allowed these plants to sell power at above-market rates. Since that time, more subsidies have followed.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) program includes waste coal in its &ldquo;Tier II&rdquo; category under which facilities collectively received over $2.5 million in subsidies in 2018. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Coal Refuse Energy and Reclamation Tax Credit already provides $10 million in annual subsidies and a new subsidy bill (SB 618) would, if passed, increase that to $45 million. In addition to direct subsidies like these, we also see repeated efforts at the state and federal level to roll back environmental protections to benefit these plants.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">In addition to all these existing subsidies, 7.9 million tons of free allowances will amount to another gift worth about $40 million. The DEP will effectively be saying that most plants must pay something to offset the damage their carbon pollution is causing, but the rest of us will pick up the tab for waste coal. Worse yet, when dirty energy is subsidized, that makes it that much harder for cleaner and better alternatives to compete in the market.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet=""""><u><strong>DEP Should Rethink its Waste Coal Policy</strong></u></p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Pennsylvania policymakers should also take a hard look at the costs vs. benefits from waste coal, including a thorough assessment of the public health and climate damage it is causing. If the state decides to accept the public health risks and continue subsidizing these plants, it must narrowly target those subsidies to prevent paying for more pollution.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">At a minimum, that means the DEP should insert basic criteria into its CO2 credit trading rule that ensures the citizens of Pennsylvania will see a net benefit. For example, when Maryland gives plants allowances through their Limited Industrial Exemption Set-aside Account (<a href=""http://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/comarhtml/26/26.09.02.06.htm"">LIESA</a>), they require plants to submit a climate action plan demonstrating that they have employed reasonably available methods to reduce their CO2 emissions. Similarly, the DEP could require waste coal operators receiving additional subsidies to document that:</p>

<ul font-size:="""" style=""padding: 0px 40px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">
	<li>we are remediating the most damaging waste piles first;</li>
	<li>we are not overlooking cheaper solutions to stabilize particular waste piles;</li>
	<li>plants are operating as cleanly and efficiently as possible;</li>
	<li>plants are in compliance with all environmental regulations;</li>
	<li>And, we are not subsidizing polluting plants more than is absolutely necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet=""""><u><strong>Planning for the Retirement of Waste Coal</strong></u></p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">The DEP&rsquo;s should also address a significant issue with how it reduces set aside allowances as power generation reduces over time.When DEP sets the initial carbon cap, it will consider the amount of electricity generation we expect to consume and the carbon intensity of our available generation mix. Multiplied together, that will give us the amount of CO2 allowances needed to satisfy demand. If the cap is too high, the credits will be devalued and won&rsquo;t drive emissions reductions. If the cap is too low, there is a risk that the cost-containment reserve will be triggered and more allowances will be added to the pool.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Because <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/emissions/"">waste coal emits</a> about 1.3 tons of CO2 per MWh of generation, the 7.9 million tons of allowances equates to about 5.9 million MWh of generation. Nobody is building new coal or nuclear plants in Pennsylvania, so when that waste coal retires, it&rsquo;s likely to be replaced with some natural gas generation, some clean renewable generation, and efficiency improvements.Natural gas&mdash;the dirtiest of the likely alternatives&mdash;produces about half a ton of CO2 per MWh and the other options produce zero, so the worst-case scenario would be that the lost generation from waste coal can be replaced with just 3.0 million allowances. The other 2.9 million allowances are unneeded, but added to the pool anyway which will depress allowance prices and allow emissions growth.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Reaching net-zero carbon pollution by 2050 will continue to be a challenge and what to do with waste coal is part of that question.While we work to solve that problem, it&rsquo;s vital we don&rsquo;t make the situation worse. Governor Wolf&rsquo;s plan to institute a carbon cap is an important step, but creating loopholes for polluters is a dangerous precedent.</p>

<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1rem; position: relative; line-height: inherit; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(58, 58, 58); font-family: Hind, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">If it becomes law, HB 1100 will enable this highly polluting industry to grow and expand with the use of subsidies financed by Pennsylvania&rsquo;s taxpayers for the next 30 years. If not stopped, this legislation will write Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economic future and tie us more deeply than ever to fossil fuels, fracked gas, petrochemicals and plastics. </p>

<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1rem; position: relative; line-height: inherit; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(58, 58, 58); font-family: Hind, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Along with our many allies across the state, we have mounted a fierce fight. We believe HB 1100 is rooted in corporate greed and preys not only on the largesse of taxpayers, but on the desperation of regions like northeast Pennsylvania, where family-sustaining wages and jobs are dwindling. It&rsquo;s created an environment where any economic salvation, even giveaways to petrochemical manufacturers, are being embraced, despite the impacts this industry will have on our communities, health, land, air and water.</p>

<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1rem; position: relative; line-height: inherit; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(58, 58, 58); font-family: Hind, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">On March 9, we stood in the State Capitol with our allies in the legislature. We stood with other organizations, including grassroots folk from as far away as western Pennsylvania&rsquo;s frontline communities, who are dealing with chronic pollution and are now standing against any further suffering this industry will bring if allowed to expand. We stood on behalf of over 30 co-sponsoring organizations to &ldquo;Fight for Our Future.&rdquo;</p>

<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1rem; position: relative; line-height: inherit; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(58, 58, 58); font-family: Hind, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">And while we stood, representatives from other interests stood over us&mdash;literally watching from the balcony of the rotunda&mdash;where an hour later they were to mount their own media event, in favor of HB 1100. Point, counterpoint.</p>

<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1rem; position: relative; line-height: inherit; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(58, 58, 58); font-family: Hind, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">What our diverse coalition of 35 groups and legislative allies did not see coming was what happened two days later. In Wilkes-Barre, 100 miles north of Harrisburg, political champions of HB 1100, representatives of specific labor unions, and friends of frackers, rallied in favor of the jobs they are being promised if HB 1100 becomes law. Jobs that will foul our air and water, kill our climate, and soak our communities in toxins, but jobs nonetheless. Our opponents&rsquo; messaging&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;re for jobs&rdquo;&mdash;went unanswered that day by those of us who also stand for jobs&mdash;jobs that also will sustain families&mdash;but jobs that will not pollute our environment and health. Jobs that center on clean manufacturing and renewable energy instead of petrochemicals.</p>

<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1rem; position: relative; line-height: inherit; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(58, 58, 58); font-family: Hind, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">HB 1100 has captured the imaginations and support of Republican, Independent and Democratic elected officials alike, including those beyond northeast Pennsylvania. But it&rsquo;s the northeast delegation who are carrying the lion&rsquo;s share of industry&rsquo;s water on this fight. How is it that those same imaginations are not able to dream of a different future for Pennsylvania, one that makes major investments in renewable energy and clean manufacturing rather than relying on us fracking and cracking our way into a paycheck?</p>

Part of that ad can be seen above. These elected officials must be held accountable for this taxpayer giveaway, and whatever harm this greedy industry causes to our future.</p>

Tom Wolf, who is expected to veto. Next, very possibly, could be a vote to overturn the veto. Who will support the Governor&rsquo;s veto to kill HB 1100&rsquo;s petrochemical subsidy, and who will not?</p>

If there was truly to be a powerful and impactful response to House Bill 1100, it would have to be a coordinated effort amongst partners to not only spread the word, but to pack the steps of the rotunda in a show of force.

Why Does Pennsylvania Insist on Offering Subsidies to Fracked Gas and Petrochemicals? The Industries Would Collapse Without Them,2/19/2020,"<p>Harrisburg policymakers are, again, debating whether to give more taxpayer-funded handouts to the fracking and petrochemical industries. It continues a quiet truth about Pennsylvania&rsquo;s so-called fracking miracle&mdash;without taxpayers padding industry profits, its presence in the Commonwealth would collapse. It&rsquo;s high time we tell our elected officials to stop propping up the fracking and petrochemical industry in Pennsylvania and instead build a diverse, long-term sustainable economy.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, state legislators approved House Bill 1100 which, if signed by the governor, would provide billions of dollars in taxpayer handouts over the next 30 years to a suite of petrochemical, plastics, and cracker plant facilities.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a new idea. It is modeled after a $1.6 billion tax handout generously given to Royal Dutch Shell in 2012, which is underpinning the construction of a massive factory along the Ohio River in Beaver County that will turn fracked gas into plastics feedstock.

It&rsquo;s also an astronomical price to pay for an economically and environmentally unsustainable industry.</p>

<p><u>Natural Gas Industry Teetering on a Financial Cliff</u></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to attain a clear picture of the financial woes facing the fracked gas and petrochemical industries and why they need a taxpayer bailout.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.eenews.net/stories/1061136849"">According to E&amp;E News</a>, the fracked gas industry is headed for a financial cliff because the initial generation of fracked wells are falling in productivity. In order for companies to grow and provide shareholders profits, they need to drill more wells in less ideal locations, increasing their costs for declining benefit.</p>

<p>This is having devastating impacts on fracking companies. According to a study <a href=""http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Q4-2018_More-Red-Flags-on-Fracking_March-2019.pdf"">by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis</a>, a group of 29 large shale gas companies in 2018 had their spending outpace reported income by $6.7 billion. From 2010 to 2018, those companies recorded a cash flow totaling negative $181 billion.</p>

<p>Since 2015, there have been 172 gas <a href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/2019/06/23/former-shale-gas-ceo-says-shale-revolution-has-been-disaster-drillers-investors"">&ldquo;exploration and production&rdquo; company bankruptcies</a> involving nearly a hundred billion dollars of debt, including 42 &ldquo;E&amp;P&rdquo; <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bankruptcies-in-Fracking-Sector-Mount-in-2019_January-2020.pdf"">bankruptcies in 2019</a>. Given the massive wave of debt facing the industry, more bankruptcies <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bankruptcies-in-Fracking-Sector-Mount-in-2019_January-2020.pdf"">are all but certain</a>.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania natural gas players are at the center of this financial cliff. In the largest write-down by an energy producer in years, <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/chevron-facing-fossil-fuels-glut-takes-10-billion-charge-11576012579"">Chevron reported recently</a> it is cutting the value of several properties, notably its shale holdings in Appalachia, by more than $10 billion. According to the Wall Street Journal, this move represents a &ldquo;concession that...some of its holdings won&rsquo;t be profitable anytime soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More proof can be found in CNX Resources, a <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/01/31/Marcellus-shale-gas-reserves-CNX-EQT-Chevron-pennsylvania/stories/202001300154"">Washington County-based shale gas company</a> that is writing down $446 million in assets in central Pennsylvania. The move means that oil and gas reserves in that area are no longer considered economic and will not be developed in the near future.</p>

<p>Perhaps most important is Pittsburgh-based EQT Corp., the largest fracked gas producer in the country. <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/01/31/Marcellus-shale-gas-reserves-CNX-EQT-Chevron-pennsylvania/stories/202001300154"">The company recently announced</a> it will write down between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion in assets. In total, EQT, Range Resources, and CNX <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/pittsburghs-fracking-industry-cut-more-than-400-jobs-in-2019-with-more-cuts-likely-on-the-way/Content?oid=16477996"">have cut a combined total</a> of more than 400 jobs since January 2019.</p>

<p>Former EQT CEO Steve Schlotterbeck <a href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/2019/06/23/former-shale-gas-ceo-says-shale-revolution-has-been-disaster-drillers-investors"">put it succinctly in June 2019</a> to a crowd of petrochemical industrialists that, &ldquo;The shale gas revolution has frankly been an unmitigated disaster for any buy-and-hold investor in the shale gas industry with very few limited exceptions.&rdquo; Schlotterbeck ended, &ldquo;The industry is self-destructive.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u>Fossil Fuel Industries Require Taxpayer Handouts to Stay Afloat</u></p>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise then that fossil fuel companies like fracking and petrochemical companies require taxpayer handouts to be successful. And during the modern day history of these industries, federal and state governments on behalf of taxpayers have fronted that bill.</p>

<p>Our federal government provides both direct and indirect subsidies to the fossil fuel industry at an alarming rate. <a href=""https://www.eesi.org/files/FactSheet_Fossil_Fuel_Subsidies_0719.pdf"">According to a report</a> from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, conservative estimates put direct U.S. subsidies to the fossil fuel industry at about $20 billion per year, with about 80 percent of that allocated to the fracked gas and crude oil segments.</p>

<p>The situation is similar in Pennsylvania. <a href=""/Files/News/FossilFuelSubsidyReport_PennFuture.pdf"">According to a PennFuture report</a>, taxpayers provided more than $3.2 billion in fossil fuel subsidies during fiscal year 2012-2013, which equals $794 per Pennsylvania taxpayer. Approximately 92 percent ($3 billion) of these subsidies came in the form of tax breaks.</p>

<p>Adding billions more in state taxpayer largesse through House Bill 1100 would be more of the same for both the industry and Pennsylvania. In fact, groups like <a href=""https://www.theintelligencer.net/news/top-headlines/2018/06/shale-crescent-usa-wants-to-rebrand-region/"">Shale Crescent USA</a> and the <a href=""https://www.pachamber.org/media/2516/Forge_the_Future_Phase_2_Report_101118/"">PA Chamber of Business and Industry</a> are pitching the so-called Appalachian Storage Hub&mdash;a sprawling, multi-state complex of petrochemical cracker plants, plastics manufacturing, compressor stations, pipelines, and underground storage facilities&mdash;as a sort of savior to the failing fracking industry.</p>

<p>The so-called economic miracle of fracking is now being replaced by the promise of plastics, except the petrochemical industry requires the same subsidies and deregulation that the fracking industry did to stay afloat. We&rsquo;re simply replacing one failing industry with another, both leaders in polluting our air, water, and climate.</p>

<p><u>Regions that Tie Their Economic Future to Subsidized Industries are in Trouble</u></p>

<p>Those pushing billions in subsidies to the industry frame them as necessary for economic expansion and prosperity in areas that desperately need both. Family-sustaining jobs are promised as our leaders shell out tax breaks and subsidies at an alarming rate to executives and shareholders.</p>

<p>The problem with that thinking is that geographic areas that have linked their economic futures to fracked gas and petrochemicals are still experiencing population losses. For instance, from the period of 2010 to 2018, the Pittsburgh metropolitan area - which includes all of southwestern Pennsylvania, experienced a population loss of -1.4 percent.</p>

<p>In comparison, <a href=""https://www.coalfieldjustice.org/blog/2020/2/14/fracking-and-petrochemicals-good-for-our-economic-future"">metropolitan areas that don&rsquo;t link</a> their economies to fracking and petrochemicals have done much better: Columbus, Ohio had its population increase by 13.1 percent, Lexington, Kentucky saw a 9.4 percent increase, and Indianapolis experienced a 5.7 percent increase.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear the industry relies on government intervention to stay afloat, even in the face of statistics that show population and jobs losses in the areas where the industry is most prominent.One last example hammers home that point: like Pennsylvania, Louisiana offers generous taxpayer handouts to the fracked gas and petrochemical industries, <a href=""https://twitter.com/RyanDeto/status/1228007439695581184?s=20"">but the state has lost</a> 40,000 manufacturing jobs in the last 20 years.</p>

<p>All of this information begs a question: if the industry is performing this poorly here and nationally despite taxpayer subsidies, where would it be without government intervention? And why are our leaders in Pennsylvania relying on such an unstable and uneconomic industry?</p>

<p><u>Pennsylvania Should Reject Fossil Fuel Subsidies Once and For All</u></p>

<p>This ongoing push for a bailout should put industry priorities in clear view: they&rsquo;re trying to squeeze as much profit out of the state as they can before packing up and leaving Pennsylvania. Like the coal and oil barons before them, the fracking and petrochemical industrieswill leave taxpayers withdebt, orphaned wells, brownfields, environmental clean-up, and an unstable economy.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania should reject the taxpayer bailout charade of House Bill 1100 and instead plan and invest in a more strategic, long-term sustainable, and environmentally positive economy that won&rsquo;t put taxpayers and communities in harms way.</p>

What is the Transportation and Climate Initiative?,2/11/2020,"<p>Gov. Tom Wolf&rsquo;s administration has released an initial proposal for how Pennsylvania might cap carbon emissions from the state&rsquo;s electricity sector, the first step in <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-First-Glimpse-PennFuture-analyzes-draft-of-DEPs-cap-and-invest-program"">potentially joining a regional emission trading system</a>.</p>

<p>At PennFuture, we have long called for Pennsylvania to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But we know the electricity sector only accounts for a third of U.S. carbon emissions. That&rsquo;s why Pennsylvania and other Northeast and Mid Atlantic states exploring another &ldquo;cap-and-invest&rdquo; approach&mdash;to address transportation-related carbon pollution&mdash;is equally important.</p>

<p>Transportation accounts for <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=41093"">37 percent of energy consumed</a> in the United States and about an equal share of the greenhouse gas emissions from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.</p>

<p>State leaders recognize that more aggressive action is needed to halt the rise in transportation-related pollution and to empower a cleaner future. Pennsylvania is among 12 states and Washington, D.C. now considering a proposed approach to raise up to $68 billion over 10 years to modernize our public transportation systems, expand electric vehicle charging networks and transition fleets of heavy-duty vehicles to run on cleaner fuels.</p>

<p>The program is calledthe <a href=""http://www.transportationandclimate.org/"">T</a><a href=""https://www.transportationandclimate.org/"">ransportation and Climate Initiative (TCI)</a>, a coalition of state regulators who recently proposed a cap-and-invest framework for the transportation sector. The proposal sets a goal to reduce carbon emissions 20&ndash;25 percent below 2005 levels by 2032. As a cap-and-invest policy, regulated entities would be provided annual carbon pollution &ldquo;allowances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unlike the power, industrial, or building sectors, the transportation sector is <a href=""https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/10/everything-you-need-know-about-fastest-growing-source-global-emissions-transport"">far more distributed and complex</a>. Across the region, more than 52 million tailpipes&mdash;from cars, light duty trucks, and other vehicles&mdash;spew gasoline and diesel-based exhaust and contribute to climate change. That said, like the other sectors of the economy, technology solutions are emerging and getting cheaper every year, including electric vehicle technologies, new charging infrastructure, and new vehicle efficiency technologies and materials, among others.</p>

<p>To catalyze these investments, state regulators have considered a range of policy approaches. Options include tightening vehicle fuel efficiency standards, placing a carbon tax on fuel consumption, or enacting carbon regulations on the country&rsquo;s 1,400 crude oil producers.</p>

<p>The TCI coalition is looking seriously at the latter of these options. The<a href=""https://www.transportationandclimate.org/main-menu/tcis-regional-policy-design-process-2019"">draft framework would limit pollution</a> from entities who supply fuel directly to the TCI members. Fuel distributors would need to stay within an overall pollution limit beginning at 254 million metric tons per year in 2022. Distributors would purchase allowances proportional to their contributions to regional transport emissions. Allowances would decrease over time, drawing down total emissions.</p>

<p>There are 14 large oil refineries located in the TCI states. These and other regional suppliers would potentially be regulated by the framework. Owners of terminals and pipelines may also be included under future rules.</p>

<p>Pollution allowances would be auctioned by the states and the proceeds would be invested into cleaner, more resilient, more equitable low-carbon transportation systems that not only reduce pollution but also mitigate the costs to consumers. Initial estimates forecast that allowance prices of about $22 per ton would be necessary by 2022 in order to reach the 25 percent emission-reduction target. If prices reached such levels, the framework would raise about $5.6 billion per year.</p>

<p>Within this &ldquo;pay to pollute&rdquo; model, TCI is considering an alternative for distributors who may not wish to buy allowances. A potentially more affordable option would be to purchase carbon offsets. These projects would have to demonstrate verifiable, voluntary carbon reductions from investments in various sustainable forestry, agriculture or clean energy activities.</p>

<p>TCI states have yet to adopt their rules or to announce their proposed emission limits. Until then, the cost of the program is unclear, with ranges that depend on the aggressiveness of allowance caps. Initial studies predict gasoline consumers may be charged 7&ndash;29 cents more per gallon over 12 years, but consumers can control costs through the use of more efficient vehicles, public transportation, reducing unnecessary trips through telecommuting, or other cleaner transportation policies. Potential investments made in infrastructure projects and more efficient technologies would offset these costs and give consumers even more choices.</p>

<p>In fact, if spread across the transportation economy, the framework&rsquo;s benefits far outweigh potential program costs. <a href=""https://www.georgetownclimate.org/files/report/GCC-Reducing_GHG_Emissions_from_Transportation-11.24.15.pdf"">A TCI analysis estimates</a> net economic savings of $28.7&ndash;$54.5 billion for businesses and $3.6&ndash;$18 billion for consumers over a 15-year period. A cleaner, more efficient transportation system would also help avoid more than 1,000 premature deaths, prevent 1,300 asthma attacks and dodge 1,700 traffic injuries&mdash;resulting in up to $10 billion in public health benefits per year.</p>

<p>Recent polls suggest strong support among both urban and rural commuters. A <a href=""https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/TNC_TCI_Survey_2019_Public.pdf"">November 2019 survey found</a> 63 percent of Pennsylvania respondents would be willing to pay up to $20 per month to fund cleaner transportation choices across the state.</p>

<p>It is critical for Pennsylvania to consider the transportation sector when determining how we can best address climate change. PennFuture will continue to closely follow the Transportation Climate Initiative and fight for ambitious and equitable policies to transition our carbon-based economy. Stay tuned for more updates as proposed regulations take shape.</p>

"Fallacy, Fiction, and Falsehoods: Debunking RGGI Myths Part 1",2/4/2020,"<p>On January 31st, 2020 the Department of Environmental Protection <a href=""http://On January 31st, 2020 the Department of Environmental Protection released its proposal to advance a cap-and-invest program to reduce carbon emissions in Pennsylvania that is compatible with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Facing the prospect of actually having to pay for their pollution rather than being allowed to dump it in the air for free, polluters and their friends are mobilizing to oppose the proposal with fallacies and mistruths.  Check out PennFuture’s primer on the RGGI process and its role in cutting the Commonwealth’s carbon emissions as well as an assessment of why efforts by the legislature to limit the Governor’s climate authority are misguided  Below are three of the most inaccurate statements made so far by polluter-friendly elected officials in Pennsylvania, along with responses debunking these dubious and misleading claims.   1. Legislative approval is required to execute a carbon cap-and-trade program. On Jan. 16., state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe sent a letter to the executive committee of RGGI, asking them not to move forward with Pennsylvania’s proposed entry into RGGI. In his letter, Metcalfe claimed Pennsylvania has a “rogue governor” and that “Pennsylvania law requires that in order for the governor to execute a carbon cap-and-trade program such as RGGI, explicit approval is required from our Commonwealth’s legislative branch.”  Response:  Legislative approval is not required. Pennsylvania’s Air Pollution Control Act gives the DEP, through approval of the Environmental Quality Board (EQB), very clear authority to set limits on pollution and, where necessary, cooperate with other states to do so. The DEP’s proposed rule couldn’t be more clear that interstate compact is required. It says “The Department will determine whether to participate in multistate CO2 allowance auctions in coordination with other participating states or to conduct Pennsylvania-run auctions…”—the proposal also contains specific provisions for a Pennsylvania-run program and says that we will only participate in a multi-state auction if the DEP determines there is one that is compatible with our program and the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs.  Article I § 27 of Pennsylvania’s Constitution says that our “public natural resources are the common property of all the people” and that the Commonwealth acts as trustee to “conserve and maintain” those resources. Instead of questioning the governor’s authority to act, Rep. Metcalfe should ask himself why he thinks it’s acceptable for polluting industries to dump their waste products into our air for free. How is that consistent with his oath of office?  2. Pennsylvania is already a leader in cutting carbon emissions, so joining RGGI is not needed. In an Oct. 16 edition of the Pennsylvania Business Report, Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman argued that “Pennsylvania is out ahead of many states when it comes to reducing carbon emissions through the RGGI compact...But joining a compact where you give up state independence, in an area where we are already making improvements, seems shortsighted and leaves us open to the possibility of being stuck with the poor decisions and outcomes for others in the agreement.”  Similarly, in a news release issued on Oct. 3, the House Republican Caucus argued that “Pennsylvania’s energy sector is currently reducing greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 30 percent in recent years, according to some estimates, and the industry is doing this without burdensome regulations.”  Response: Of course Senator Corman and the House Republican Caucus know they are comparing apples and oranges—they just hope you don’t notice. For all its “progress,” Pennsylvania is the fourth-highest emitter of carbon pollution in the nation behind California, Texas, and Florida. New natural gas plants have driven most of our coal generation out of business reducing our emissions, but we started with about one and a half times the coal generation as all of the other RGGI states combined. This is a case of being so far behind, the Senator thinks we are in first place. The real issue though is not what we did, but how we move forward.  We don’t have enough coal left for the trends of the past to continue and neither the Senator nor the Republican Caucus have a plan to solve our emissions problem. Rather than reducing emissions, they are working on a package of bills to further subsidize fossil fuel generation. Gas has likely already become a bigger source of carbon pollution than coal in the state and replacing additional lost generation with gas will result in net increases in pollution—we can’t drill our way to a clean and healthy environment.    Instead of more fossil fuel subsidies, we need to implement a program like RGGI to cap carbon pollution and invest in carbon-free alternatives like clean renewable energy and energy efficiency. A recent report by The Analysis Group shows CO2 emissions in the RGGI states have dropped from over 180 million tons per year to under 80 million tons per year while providing over $1.4 billion in net economic benefits. That is the kind of progress we need. 3. Joining RGGI will increase electricity prices and result in job losses. In a June 24 article published by the Commonwealth Foundation, the author implies that RGGI will result in a 64 percent increase in the price of electricity, while it will also result in a loss of between 7,000 to 11,000 jobs per year.  Response:  To come by those shocking numbers, the Commonwealth Foundation relies on a “working paper” by David Stephenson of the Caesar Rodney Institute. Both organizations are part of a Koch-funded umbrella organization called the State Policy Network that actively opposes climate change regulations, so it shouldn’t surprise anyone that they are cherry-picking data to try and make their point. What is surprising is that the Commonwealth Foundation found it necessary to cherry-pick data from a report that already cherry-picked data. The underlying report actually says prices in RGGI increased less than the average in the US, they just increased more than “comparison states.” If you skip their alternative facts altogether and go directly to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) report on average state prices (the authority they cite) you get a much different picture. Average price per megawatt hour (MWh) across all sectors in RGGI did rise 7% from 2007 through 2016, but the prices in Pennsylvania and the U.S. as a whole rose more than 12% over that same time period. If you update the data to 2018 (the most current available) RGGI is even better with a 6.6% increase from 2007 compared to an 11.2% increase in Pennsylvania and 15.3% for the U.S. as a whole. The other critical factor groups like this purposely ignore is that the cost per MWh is only one part of your bill. If a family or business installs solar generation or invests in energy efficiency, their monthly electric bills can drop substantially even if the retail price of power goes up. The RGGI states take advantage of this by investing in efficiency and renewable—far more than Pennsylvania. To make their claims on job losses, the Commonwealth Foundation resorts to another report from a State Policy Network affiliate, this time from Rhode Island. The really surprising thing about this report is that it doesn’t pretend to be about RGGI at all—this is a report about renewable energy portfolio standards that tries to claim investing in clean renewable generation though programs like Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) causes job losses. What we know for a fact is that the remaining large coal plants in Pennsylvania are all nearing retirement age and no plans are on the table to build more. These plants will eventually close with or without RGGI—we need to plan for what is next. Adding more natural gas is a climate killer so we need better choices. Right now, far from being sources of job losses, the largest job growth sectors in the U.S. are solar installers and wind technicians. Pennsylvania in particular has over 68,000 energy efficiency jobs and over 9,000 renewable energy jobs. Clean and renewable energy has more potential job growth than dirty fossil fuels. Next steps The title of this blog says it’s “Part 1” of a series debunking lies, myths, and misconceptions about RGGI and carbon pricing. While it would be nice if a “Part 2” was not required, the people who are making these claims are not likely to stop. Back in 1710, Jonathan Swift wrote that “if a lie be believ’d only for an hour, it has done its work, and there is no farther occasion for it.”  Unfortunately, that is just as true today.

<p>What is surprising is that the Commonwealth Foundation found it necessary to cherry-pick data from a report that already cherry-picked data. The underlying report actually says prices in RGGI increased less than the average in the US, they just increased more than &ldquo;comparison states.&rdquo; If you skip their alternative facts altogether and go directly to the Energy Information Administrations (EIA) <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/avgprice_annual.xlsx"">report on average state prices</a> (the authority they cite) you get a much different picture.</p>

<p>Average price per megawatt hour (MWh) across all sectors in RGGI did rise 7% from 2007 through 2016, but the prices in Pennsylvania and the U.S. as a whole rose more than 12% over that same time period. If you update the data to 2018 (the most current available) RGGI is even better with a 6.6% increase from 2007 compared to an 11.2% increase in Pennsylvania and 15.3% for the U.S. as a whole.</p>

<p>The other critical factor groups like this purposely ignore is that the cost per MWh is only one part of your bill. If a family or business installs solar generation or invests in energy efficiency, their monthly electric bills can drop substantially even if the retail price of power goes up. The RGGI states take advantage of this by investing in efficiency and renewable&mdash;far more than Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>To make their claims on job losses, the Commonwealth Foundation resorts to another report from a State Policy Network affiliate, this time from Rhode Island. The really surprising thing about this report is that it doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be about RGGI at all&mdash;this is a report about renewable energy portfolio standards that tries to claim investing in clean renewable generation though programs like Pennsylvanias Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) causes job losses.</p>

<p>What we know for a fact is that the remaining large coal plants in Pennsylvania are all nearing retirement age and no plans are on the table to build more. These plants will eventually close with or without RGGI&mdash;we need to plan for what is next. Adding more natural gas is a climate killer so we need better choices. Right now, far from being sources of job losses, the largest job growth sectors in the U.S. are solar installers and wind technicians. Pennsylvania in particular has over 68,000 energy efficiency jobs and over 9,000 renewable energy jobs. Clean and renewable energy has more potential job growth than dirty fossil fuels.</p>

<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>

<p>The title of this blog says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Part 1&rdquo; of a series debunking lies, myths, and misconceptions about RGGI and carbon pricing. While it would be nice if a &ldquo;Part 2&rdquo; was not required, the people who are making these claims are not likely to stop. Back in 1710, Jonathan Swift wrote that &ldquo;if a lie be believ&rsquo;d only for an hour, it has done its work, and there is no farther occasion for it.&rdquo; Unfortunately, that is just as true today.</p>

First Glimpse: PennFuture analyzes draft of DEP's cap-and-invest program,2/4/2020,"<p>On February 13th, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Air/AirQuality/AQPortalFiles/Advisory%20Committees/Air%20Quality%20Technical%20Advisory%20Committee/2020/2-13-20/AQTAC%20PA%20CO2%20Budget%20Trading%20Program_February%202020.pdf"">will be presenting the first draft</a> of the regulatory language for a <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Air/AirQuality/AQPortalFiles/Advisory%20Committees/Air%20Quality%20Technical%20Advisory%20Committee/2020/2-13-20/Draft%20PRN%20CO2%20Budget%20Trading%20Annex%20A%201-30-20.pdf"">&ldquo;CO2 Budget Trading Program&rdquo;</a> to the Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee (AQTAC), a <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-So-Pennsylvania-Might-Join-RGGI-What-Comes-Next"">positive next step</a> in a long 18 to 24 month regulatory process. The draft provides some key details&mdash;and questions&mdash;on the Governor&rsquo;s intention to create a state cap-and-trade program to cut electricity sector carbon emission.</p>

<p><strong>How does Cap-and-Invest Work?</strong></p>

<p>Cap-and-invest is a longstanding carbon reduction tool with a very straightforward concept: the state sets a carbon limit for an industry that declines over time and provides annual &ldquo;allowances&rdquo; to carbon polluters.</p>

<p>In the case of Pennsylvania, the Governor intends to enact a cap-and-invest program for power plants with a capacity over 25 megawatts (MW). Power plant owners must obtain allowances for each ton of pollution they emit in any given year. As the carbon cap decreases, the cost of allowances will increase and polluters will be incentivized to invest in lower-carbon technologies. For those generators that continue to emit, the costs of pollution will be better reflected in the wholesale price of the energy they sell.</p>

<p>Economically, this is the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle in action&mdash;rather than subsidizing the cost of pollution for dirty plants, we will monetize the costs of that pollution and let the market make better-informed choices about what power to buy. The proceeds from power plant owners buying allowances would be invested back into efforts to reduce air and carbon pollution.</p>

<p>When this rule goes into effect in Pennsylvania, the DEP will issue a specific number of allowances, each one representing one ton of CO2 emissions. To emit carbon pollution, power plants will need to obtain sufficient allowances. For example, a reasonably modern natural gas plant will require about one allowance for every two and a half megawatt hours (MWh) of generation. Coal plants, which produce significantly more carbon pollution, will need around twice as many allowances per MWh. Of course, carbon free generation like nuclear, wind, and solar won&rsquo;t need any allowances at all.</p>

<p><strong>What Choices will Polluters Have?</strong></p>

<p>Given a choice, carbon polluters would want to keep the status quo where they get to dump pollution in the air for free. While this proposal closes that particular candy store, companies still have a number of options to make compliance easier and less costly.</p>

<p><u><em>Pollution Prevention</em></u>: Investing in efficiency improvements or changing their operations so they emit less pollution. When pollution is no longer free such changes will be more cost-effective.</p>

<p><u><em>Permit Conditions</em></u>: Power plant units supplying electricity to industrial facilities that don&rsquo;t send a significant amount of power to the grid or other facilities may be able to make minor changes to their operating permits and be exempt from the program entirely.</p>

<p><em><u>Offsets</u></em>: Power plant units may also be able to reduce their need for allowances by offsetting their pollution with verifiable reductions from other projects. This could be capturing landfill methane, sequestering carbon through reforestation, avoiding methane through better agricultural practices, or&mdash;and this is particularly important in Pennsylvania&mdash;plugging abandoned oil and gas wells.</p>

<p><strong>Where do Companies get Allowances?</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, many electricity generators are going to need to obtain at least some allowances and, for that, the proposed rule sets up an auction program.</p>

<p>An auction program could be developed in several different ways, but the draft doesn&rsquo;t specify which would be prefered. Pennsylvania could provide a &ldquo;clearing price&rdquo; auction where participants submit sealed bids for the number of allowances they want and the price they will pay, and everyone pays the price in the lowest winning bid. It could also create a &ldquo;pay-as-bid&rdquo; auction where all the winners pay what they bid. Or, it could be a multi-round auction where participants can adjust their bidding strategy between rounds. The mechanics may differ, but the goal is to discover what the market thinks is a fair price for allowances rather than a &ldquo;command and control&rdquo; system where the DEP sets the price entirely on its own.</p>

<p>While DEP can run the auction entirely on its own, it also has the option of joining a multi-state market&mdash;like RGGI&mdash;if it determines that there is an appropriate market to join and the benefits outweigh the costs. It is expected they will. Economies of scale with a bigger market will reduce our share of the administrative and support costs, a multi-state market can lessen concerns about cross-border effects, and large markets can even lower the cost of compliance for participants. This is where RGGI comes into play. If we do join a multistate market, RGGI is the logical choice.</p>

<p><strong>Features of DEP&rsquo;s Proposal</strong></p>

<p><u><em>Guardrails Around Allowance Prices</em></u>:Preventing price shocks for consumers is always an important concern and spikes in fossil generation caused by severe weather could cause problems. Like all of the RGGI states, DEP proposes to mitigate this concern with a cost containment reserve (CCR). The CCR will make additional allowances available to keep costs down if the auction price is higher than a specified trigger price. On the other hand, unexpected retirements of polluting plants could make demand for allowances drop sharply. While lowering emissions is a good thing, a sharp fall in prices may make the program less effective at incentivising further emissions reductions. For that reason, DEP is proposing an emissions containment reserve (ECR). Similar to the CCR, the ECR would withhold allowances if the cost of reductions is much lower than expected.</p>

<p><u><em>Free Allowances for Waste Coal</em></u>:The proposal also uses free allowances as a policy tool. The draft program proposes to give away free allowances to further subsidize waste coal generators&rsquo; continued pollution. Waste coal proponents claim that they are providing an environmental service by cleaning up abandoned waste coal piles that are polluting our land and water. While burning these coal piles is one way of removing them, this proposal doesn&rsquo;t require the DEP to first determine that burning the coal is the best option available, it doesn&rsquo;t attempt to prioritize removal of the most problematic waste piles first, and it doesn&rsquo;t require any analysis to ensure the benefits these plants provide to justify the value of all the subsidies they are getting. This is a detail of the draft proposal that needs further attention by DEP moving forward.</p>

<p><strong>Improvements DEP Should Consider</strong></p>

<p><u><em>Planning for retirement of waste coal generation</em></u>:If subsidies for waste coal remain part of the plan, more work should be done to plan for their eventual retirement. Currently, the proposed rule says that when sufficient waste coal retires for the set-aside to be reduced or eliminated, the allowances return to the auction pool. Because waste coal produces significantly more carbon pollution per megawatt-hour than the likely alternatives, this will add unneeded allowances to the market, depressing allowance prices, and making our carbon targets harder to reach. A better choice would be to retire these allowances from the auction pool entirely. If any allowances are returned to the auction pool, they should be discounted to reflect the fact replacement generation will likely be much cleaner.</p>

<p><u><em>Protecting Voluntary Purchases of Renewable Energy</em></u>:One set-aside DEP should consider adding to the draft rule is for voluntary purchases of renewable energy. Having a cap on carbon emissions is vital, but unless we are careful, a cap can also backfire and act as a carbon floor. If households or businesses choose to purchase clean renewable generation to fight air pollution and climate change, they want to ensure that they are getting real emissions reductions. As the rule is written, however, a voluntary purchase of clean generation leaves more room under the cap for others to buy more dirty power. DEP could fix this problem by keeping a pool of credits out of the auction and retire them for each ton of emissions avoided when individuals or businesses choose to buy clean renewable generation. Without this addition, the only way an individual could ensure they were making a difference is to not only buy clean energy but also buying the allowances. Making clean-energy consumers pay twice is the exact opposite of the polluter pays principle.</p>

<p><strong>What Happens Next?</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the most important regulatory actions we have seen during the current administration, and DEP&rsquo;s proposal is a good start, but there are still opportunities to make it better. For the next few months DEP will present their ideas and get input from various advisory committees before formally proposing the rule this summer. After that, the public will have the opportunity to send in written comments and testify at hearings.</p>

National Gas Industry Plans to Spend Big to Advertise Mistruths in Western Pennsylvania,1/29/2020,"<p>Western Pennsylvania is about to be center stage in a new million-dollar public relations campaign spearheaded by the fracked gas industry&rsquo;s largest national lobbying group. But, as has been the case previously, the industry isn&rsquo;t telling the whole truth about its environmental impact and contributions to climate change.</p>

<p>The American Petroleum Institute <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/08/Oil-gas-industry-fracking-shale-drilling-Pittsburgh-messaging-campaign-pennsylvania/stories/202001080044"">recently announced that western Pennsylvania</a> will be one of several locations it will highlight as having benefited significantly from the extraction of fracked gas. The lobbying group will spend in excess of one million dollars on print and social media advertisements.</p>

<p>Specifically, the campaign is expected to hammer home a blatant mistruth consistently put forth by the industry: fracked gas is enhancing our environment, and the industry is doing its part to help combat the climate crisis.</p>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, API President and CEO Mike Sommers called fracking &ldquo;one of the most important environmental achievements in this country.&rdquo; He added that the fracked gas industry is &ldquo;stepping up to the plate to address the issue of climate change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only days later, <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/01/13/Range-Resources-DEP-order-methane-gas-leaking-Marcellus-well-Lewis-Lycoming/stories/202001130117"">another story appeared</a> in headlines that directly contradicts that assertion: a gas well drilled by Range Resources has been leaking gas into groundwater in central Pennsylvania for the last eight years. That&rsquo;s nearly 3,000 consecutive days of leakage.</p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Protection has alleged that this single well &ldquo;caused methane gas to seep into 11 drinking water supplies, nearby streams and a farm field pocked with spots of dead grass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the last eight years, DEP regulators have been met with &ldquo;sporadic cooperation&rdquo; from Range Resources, which has refused to accept responsibility and is instead claiming that the methane is naturally occurring.</p>

<p>The DEP earlier this month finally ordered the company to fix the leaking well, noting that inaction from Range Resources will &ldquo;no longer be tolerated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as if this is an isolated incident. <a href=""https://www.fractracker.org/2020/01/fracking-in-pennsylvania-in-2019/"">According to a recent report</a>, during the most recent 12-month period for which data are available, the industry was cited for 13,833 violations in Pennsylvania. The most common violation involved failure in properly storing, transporting or disposing of residual waste, while the second most common violation concerned jeopardizing clean water.</p>

<p>Does that sound like an industry that is enhancing our environment? If you need more proof, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/climate/methane-leak-satellite.html"">look to another example</a> that came in February 2018, when a blowout at a single gas well in Ohio&mdash;about 70 miles southwest of Pittsburgh&mdash;resulted in more than 60 kilotons of methane escaping into the atmosphere over a 20-day period.</p>

<p>To put it into perspective, this single incident resulted in more methane leaking into the atmosphere <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/ohio-exxon-mobil-methane-leak-satellite-climate-change/index.html"">than most countries release in an entire year</a>, all while the gas industry has worked with the Trump administration <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/climate/epa-methane-greenhouse-gas.html"">to roll back modest federal rules</a> that limit methane leaks in gas infrastructure. This doesn&rsquo;t sound like something an industry &ldquo;stepping up to the plate&rdquo; would do.</p>

<p>Still not convinced? This recent investigative report by Rolling Stone notes that <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/oil-gas-fracking-radioactive-investigation-937389/?fbclid=IwAR3dBg9Wz1bD2S_aGlPdI4R64hmuqUtkCzBym57_RY5YxeqWtI30AMKcsys"">oil and gas wells produce nearly a trillion gallons</a> of toxic waste per year. The author conducted hundreds of exhaustive interviews with scientists, regulators, industry workers and environmentalists, and he uncovered a &ldquo;sweeping arc of contamination&rdquo; to our environment, the public, and the industry&rsquo;s own employees.</p>

<p>In trying to spin and change the narrative surrounding fracked gas, the industry touts the fact that its product is a cleaner alternative to coal, which is true. But that is a far cry from saying that fracked gas on its own is a solution to climate change. To the contrary, the buildout of natural gas infrastructure <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-14/emissions-set-to-jump-on-gas-fueled-industrial-boom-study-says"">could add as much as a half billion metric tons</a> per year of carbon emissions into our atmosphere.</p>

<p>There are dozens of other instances of <a href=""https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/fracking-and-health-2/"">claims of tainted water supplies</a>, of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-OMydfBGvk&amp;feature=youtu.be"">families who allege sickness</a> stemming from nearby fracked gas operations, and of <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/news/20190829/revolution-owners-fined-319000-for-pipeline-violations"">environmental damage to streams</a> and wetlands from drilling and pipeline operations.</p>

<p>In the coming months, you might see slick advertisements on television or expensive billboards along the highway. You might hear the upbeat radio ads or see glossy ads online.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled.</p>

<p>The American Petroleum Institute is about to spend seven figures to try to convince Pennsylvanians that it is environmentally friendly and is addressing climate change. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

"The Dangers of Senate Bill 790, Part II",1/14/2020,"<p>In December, PennFuture Director of Policy Ezra Thrush<a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Dangers-of-Senate-Bill-790"">wrote a blog detailing the dangers</a> of a new piece of legislation called Senate Bill 790. Legislators left Harrisburg for the holidays without voting on the bill but, in the coming days, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives is poised to vote on it, albeit in an amended form.</p>

<p>Though it was recently amended in the House, Senate Bill 790 still representsa substantial rollback of environmental protections governing the conventional oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This bill, promoted by some legislators as a lifeline to the struggling conventional oil and gas industry, rolls back public health protections, allows for significant oil and gas spills to go unreported, and opens the door to more drilling operations across Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Other controversial provisions of the bill were amended earlier this week by the House Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committee, in an effort to garner more support from moderate Republicans and Democrats. A provision that would have allowed for drilling wastewater to be used as a road brine was eliminated, while thresholds for spill reporting were reduced.</p>

<p>The amended version of Senate Bill 790 is being touted in Harrisburg as an environmentally-sound compromise, but that&rsquo;s far from the truth. This remains a dangerous bill that would weaken environmental regulations on the oil and gas industry at a time when we need exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>This bill could receive second consideration in the House of Representatives this week, and could receive final consideration votes early next week. Gov. Tom Wolf has said he intends to veto the legislation if it reaches his desk, but PennFuture is working tirelessly to ensure this terrible legislation never makes it there.</p>

<p>You can do your part too, by contacting your local state representative and urging them to vote no on Senate Bill 790. Tell your elected leader that now is not the time to weaken regulations on the oil and gas industry.</p>
