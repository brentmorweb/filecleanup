2025 Supreme Court Environmental Decisions Recap: Limiting EPA’s Use of “End-Result” Provisions in NPDES Permits,12/31/2025,"<p>As we look forward to 2026, we wanted to share with you a series of blogs to recap of some of the worst U.S. Supreme Court decisions that will shape our ability to protect our environment for decades to come. (Blog 4/4)&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Supreme Court Limits EPA&rsquo;s Use of &ldquo;End-Result&rdquo; Provisions in NPDES Permits&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-753_f2bh.pdf"">City &amp; Cty. of S.F. v. EPA, 145 S. Ct. 704 (2025)</a>, the Supreme Court struck down certain narrative (as opposed to numeric) standards that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had included in San Francisco&rsquo;s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit under the Clean Water Act (CWA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>NPDES permits are required for discharges of pollution from a point source into waters of the United States. In this case, the San Francisco&rsquo;s wastewater treatment plant had a permit issued by EPA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Typically, an NPDES permit specifies discharge limits or treatment requirements, whether they be numeric (e.g., pH) or narrative (e.g., &ldquo;no visible sheen&rdquo;) limits. If the permit holder complies with those requirements, the &ldquo;permit shield&rdquo; provision in the CWA deems them in compliance with the Act. This approach provides regulatory certainty: following the permit&rsquo;s explicit terms should protect the permittee from additional liability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, in 2019 the EPA added two provisions to San Francisco&rsquo;s wastewater treatment permit that imposed liability if the water receiving the discharge failed to meet certain quality standards, regardless of whether the City had met all other permit conditions. One provision prohibited any discharge that &ldquo;contributes to&rdquo; a violation of applicable water quality standards. The other prohibited any discharge that &ldquo;creates pollution, contamination, or nuisance&rdquo; under California law. These types of limits are quite comment in NPDES permits, and can allow the permittee the flexibility on how to create the most cost-effective way to comply with these requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court, in overturning the permit, created a new term &ldquo;end-result provision&rdquo; and held that the CWA authorizes the EPA to impose limitations that are within the permittee&rsquo;s control, such as limits on the facility&rsquo;s own discharges, not broad results that depend on downstream conditions influenced by many other factors (e.g., the end result). By requiring San Francisco to ensure downstream water quality regardless of other pollution sources, the Supreme Court held that EPA exceeded its statutory authority. This decision unnecessarily removed a tool from the EPA&rsquo;s regulatory belt, one that will likely make it harder to keep our waters clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This case illustrates how <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PA-and-a-Post-Chevron-World"">Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</a> continues to shape judicial review of agency actions. In <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Court ended the <em>Chevron</em> doctrine, meaning courts no longer defer to an agency&rsquo;s reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutes. Instead, judges independently interpret the law&rsquo;s meaning. Here, the Court analyzed the Clean Water Act and concluded that Congress only empowered the EPA to regulate a permittee&rsquo;s own discharges not to hold it responsible for the condition of the water body as a whole. Under <em>Chevron</em>, the Court would have analyzed whether the EPA&rsquo;s interpretation of the Clean Water Act was reasonable, and if it was, they would give their interpretation deference, most likely siding with them over these provisions. Now under <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Court is given the final say in how the EPA, and other agencies, are allowed to fulfill their statutory charges. In this case, determining that the EPA&rsquo;s long-used &ldquo;end-result provisions&rdquo; are not authorized.&nbsp;</p>

2025 Supreme Court Environmental Decisions Recap: Agencies Don’t Have to Chase Every “What If”,12/31/2025,"<p>As we look forward to 2026, we wanted to share with you a series of blogs to recap of some of the worst U.S. Supreme Court decisions that will shape our ability to protect our environment for decades to come. (Blog 3/4)&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Supreme Court Says Agencies Don&rsquo;t Have to Chase Every &ldquo;What If&rdquo; in Environmental Reviews&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>When the federal government wants to build or permit something big, like a railroad, pipeline, or highway, it has to follow the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA&rsquo;s main rule is simple: before starting, the agency has to study how the project could affect the environment and determine whether that impact is &ldquo;significant.&rdquo; If so, it must write up an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), looking at those impacts and mitigation that could lessen them. But NEPA doesn&rsquo;t tell them what decision to make. It just makes sure they have&nbsp;&ldquo;taken a hard look&rdquo; before moving forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-06/23975sevencountyfinal.pdf"">Seven Cty. Infrastructure Coal. v. Eagle Cty., 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1507 (2025)</a>, seven Utah counties wanted to build an 88-mile railroad in the Uinta Basin. The agency in charge, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, put together a huge 3,600-page EIS. It looked at everything from wildlife to air quality. They also mentioned other possible mining and refining projects nearby, but since those were just ideas and not actual plans, they didn&rsquo;t go into detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A federal appeals court in D.C. said that wasn&rsquo;t good enough they wanted a deeper dive into all those &ldquo;what if&rdquo; future projects. But the Supreme Court stepped in and said: hold on. NEPA doesn&rsquo;t require agencies to analyze every hypothetical project that might someday exist. They just need to focus on the project they&rsquo;re actually reviewing and its reasonably foreseeable effects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, it&rsquo;s harder for opponents to argue that an EIS is incomplete. A challenger will need to prove that the EIS didn&rsquo;t include reasonably foreseeable effects. This bar is incredibly high as the Court emphasized;&nbsp;the agency gets a fair amount of discretion in constructing its EIS, and its length or level of detail are up to the Agency&rsquo;s discretion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This ruling sheds light on an area where <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PA-and-a-Post-Chevron-World"">Loper Bright</a>&rsquo;s power shift does not reach. In <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Supreme Court said judges, not agencies, get the final say on how federal laws are interpreted. That means courts can now take a closer look at the legal framework behind an agency&rsquo;s decisions. But here, the Court still made it clear: when it comes to the nitty-gritty details of something like an EIS, agencies get a lot of discretion. In other words, <em>Loper Bright</em> may have shifted power toward judges on what powers a statute grants, but where the statute is clear as to what it requires of an agency, the technical contents are still up to the agency experts. Even if that deference allows agencies to severely limit the allowable scope of impacts under NEPA review, as they did in <em>Seven County</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But like the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; post-<em>Sackett</em>, NEPA is also being eroded by Presidential and executive agency actions. Earlier in 2025, the Council for Environmental Quality, the agency tasked with implementing NEPA, revoked its NEPA regulations, allowing agencies to rescind and weaken their own NEPA regulations, including by replacing regulations with non-binding guidance. And just like the protection of our nation&rsquo;s wetlands, environmental impact review is now going to fall under the states, many of which do not have the laws set up to allow for this kind of review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

2025 Supreme Court Environmental Decisions Recap: Sackett v. EPA and the Clean Water Act,12/30/2025,"<p>As we look forward to 2026, we wanted to share with you a series of blogs to recap of some of the worst U.S. Supreme Court decisions that will shape our ability to protect our environment for decades to come. (Blog 2/4)&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Where the Water Flows: Sackett v. EPA and the Clean Water Act&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In 2023, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a major decision in <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-454_4g15.pdf"">Sackett v. EPA, 598 U.S. 651, 143 S. Ct. 1322 (2023)</a>, redefining the scope of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and reshaping how federal jurisdiction over wetlands is determined. While not as headline-grabbing as some other recent cases, <em>Sackett</em> has quietly redrawn the map of environmental protection in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The case began when Michael and Chantell Sackett purchased a plot of land in Idaho to build a home. Part of their property contained wetlands, which they backfilled during construction. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claimed this action violated the CWA, which prohibits &ldquo;the discharge of any pollutant&rdquo; into &ldquo;navigable waters.&rdquo; 33 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1311(a), 1362(12)(A). This prohibition applies to &ldquo;the waters of the United States&rdquo; (WOTUS) a term that sounds straightforward, but, as Justice Alito asked in his opinion, what exactly does that mean?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before <em>Sackett</em>, the EPA interpreted WOTUS broadly. In addition to traditionally navigable waters, it claimed jurisdiction over waters with a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; to navigable waters, a standard that allowed regulation of wetlands and other features connected to navigable waters in ways not always obvious to the naked eye.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court rejected this &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; test as inconsistent with the CWA&rsquo;s text and as granting the EPA jurisdiction far beyond what Congress intended. In its place, the Court adopted a narrower two-part test: First, the party asserting jurisdiction over an adjacent wetland must prove that the adjacent body of water constitutes a &ldquo;water of the United States.&rdquo; Second, the party must show that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to distinguish where the water ends and the wetland begins. This holding significantly restricts the reach of the CWA, limiting jurisdiction to wetlands that are physically and visibly connected on the surface to covered waters. Wetlands that are nearby but separated by barriers such as roads, even if hydrologically connected underground, are now outside the EPA&rsquo;s regulatory reach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The decision has two immediate effects. First, it narrows the federal government&rsquo;s authority under <a href=""https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=code+of+federal+regulations&amp;f=treesort&amp;num=4317"">33 U.S.C. &sect; 1344(g)(1)</a> and <a href=""https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-2007-title33-section1362&amp;num=0&amp;edition=2007"">&sect; 1362(7)</a>, redefining &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; in a way that excludes many wetlands previously covered. Second, it shifts regulatory responsibility for those excluded wetlands to individual states, creating the possibility of a patchwork of protections that vary widely across the country&mdash;the very thing the CWA was developed to protect against.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <em>Sackett</em> was just the beginning. This November, EPA released its new definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; that is even more restrictive than the Supreme Court directed in <em>Sackett</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/Wetlands_Report_R_25-03-B_05_locked.pdf"">recent calculations by our friends at NRDC</a>, this rule could remove federal protections from a majority of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s wetlands. Wetlands not only ensure cleaner water flowing downstream, they also:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduce flooding &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Filter harmful pollution &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Provide essential fish and wildlife habitat&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Store carbon&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Without streams and wetlands to serve as natural buffers, floodwaters rise faster and hit harder, leaving homeowners, businesses, and taxpayers with massive bills for damage, cleanup, and emergency response. Communities across Pennsylvania&ndash;both big and small&ndash; will face increased infrastructure and water treatment costs if protections are removed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And while Pennsylvania is lucky to have strong state-level water quality protections, we are not immune from the impact of the &ldquo;Polluted Water Rule.&rdquo; We must <a href=""https://secure.everyaction.com/DySHjxuLw0ivAE9lyrxzbw2?emci=1a89d85c-90df-f011-8194-000d3a1ec8c6&amp;emdi=4c09cddc-20e0-f011-8195-000d3a1d58aa&amp;ceid=6532780"">act now and speak up</a> against the gutting of the Clean Water Act!

2025 Supreme Court Environmental Decisions Recap: Loper Bright in Action: NRC v. Texas,12/29/2025,"<p>As we look forward to 2026, we wanted to share with you a series of blogs to recap of some of the worst U.S. Supreme Court decisions that will shape our ability to protect our environment for decades to come. (Blog 1/4)&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Loper Bright in Action: NRC v. Texas (June 2025)&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s recent decisions have fundamentally reshaped the way federal law is interpreted and applied. In our earlier post, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PA-and-a-Post-Chevron-World"">PA and a Post &ldquo;Chevron&rdquo; World</a>, we discussed the landmark case <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf"">Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024)</a>, which overturned the 1984 precedent of <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/resource/usrep.usrep467837/"">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984)</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under <em>Chevron</em>, when Congress left gaps or used vague language in a statute, courts would defer to an agency&rsquo;s reasonable interpretation&mdash;trusting the &ldquo;masters of the subject&rdquo; to apply their technical expertise. This approach recognized that Congress cannot predict every future development. For example, in the Clean Air Act, Congress avoided creating a closed list of pollutants, leaving room for agencies to address newly discovered threats to public health and the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But in <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Court shifted that responsibility to the judiciary. Now, judges, not agencies with knowledge and expertise, decide the meaning of ambiguous statutory terms. While agencies can still offer expert perspectives, their interpretations no longer receive automatic deference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On June 18, 2025, the Supreme Court applied this post-Loper approach in <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-1300_b97c.pdf"">NRC v. Texas, 145 S. Ct. 1762 (2025)</a>. The Court held that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) lacked authority under the Atomic Energy Act to license private interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. Reading the statute closely, the Court found that Congress assigned responsibility for long-term nuclear waste storage to the Department of Energy, not private licensees, and that, absent clear congressional authorization, the NRC could not grant such licenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The decision has sweeping implications for the nuclear energy sector. It removes a key tool, the ability of private entities to store spent fuel, and shifts the entire burden of storage to the federal government, even though federal capacity is already stretched thin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Supporters of the Court&rsquo;s shift may welcome the move as a check on agency overreach and a reaffirmation of Congress&rsquo;s role in lawmaking. Critics, however, warn that it could undermine long-standing regulations that protect public health, safety, and the environment. Without agency deference, well-established rules could be challenged, and potentially dismantled, by parties seeking to avoid compliance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In theory, Congress could respond by updating laws to meet evolving challenges. In practice, a politically divided legislature may lack the capacity or will to act quickly. For decades, expert-driven agency interpretations have helped bridge that gap, freeing Congress to address other pressing national needs. Time will only tell just how far <em>Loper Bright</em> will go in eroding federal protections, and this case was just one of the first examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Introducing PennFuture's Fall 2025 Interns,11/10/2025,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognize that we need to be more involved with cultivating the people that will continue to support our mission. Our staff have a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation. &nbsp;<br />
With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting Pennsylvania as well as to further their potential environmental careers. We&rsquo;ve seen success on this front as many of our legal interns have found work in the Pennsylvania environmental legal space. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere. &nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Over the past five years, our interns have made it possible for PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team to do more, faster, and better! They have supported our litigation efforts against water polluters and fracked-gas facilities, they have drafted comments in support of stronger regulatory protections across the Commonwealth, and they have helped our attorneys strategize and execute impactful legal actions. We are grateful for all of the hard work, passion, and dedication of our legal interns. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;<br />
This fall, we have two fantastic students, including a returning intern, joining us who bring their unique backgrounds and experiences to our mission. We&rsquo;ve asked our interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:&nbsp;</h3>

My spring internship opened my eyes to the complexity of these issues, and I realized there was so much more to learn. Motivated by this realization and the sweeping effects of the policy changes from the new administration, I was eager to return and contribute my skills to the organization during a dynamic and challenging time for energy and environmental advocacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My several years of experience in energy law makes me well-suited to support PennFuture as it navigates new challenges in this field, particularly with issues involving large load integration and the growing impact of data centers. I am grateful for the invaluable support and mentorship I have received from the legal team and look forward to supporting PennFuture&rsquo;s mission of protecting the Commonwealth&rsquo;s natural resources, promoting sound public policy, and advancing a sustainable clean energy economy.&nbsp;</p>

Widespread smog, droughts, and wildfires all plague the Los Angeles basin regularly. Spending many weekends and every summer outdoors, I knew I wanted my career to be spent fighting to protect our natural world. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In college, I majored in Environmental Thought and Practice, which deepened my interest in environmental issues, particularly the legal and policy aspects that affect our natural world. At Penn State Dickinson Law, I serve as president of the Environmental Law Society, and I hope that in this role, I can encourage more students to pursue the critical field of environmental law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This fall, I am thrilled to be part of the team at PennFuture, where I can contribute to advancing environmental policy and protecting communities and natural spaces in my new home state of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture Commends Pocono Municipalities for Preparing for Data Centers,8/28/2025,"<p>This summer has brought a flurry of activity from municipalities across the Poconos as they adopt new zoning ordinances to prepare for potential data center development. You can learn more about data centers <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/datacenters"">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Poconos&rsquo; recent experience with rapid warehouse/distribution center growth has taught the region the importance of getting zoning ordinances on the books to address this next wave of highly-impactful development. Ordinances give municipalities the power to control where data center development occurs and under what conditions. Without them, municipalities lose this control. That is especially true in Pennsylvania because our Supreme Court has held that the Pennsylvania constitution requires every municipality to allow for every legitimate land use somewhere within its borders. This means municipalities do not have the option of saying &ldquo;no thank you&rdquo; to data centers, and a municipality that fails to address data centers in its zoning ordinance runs the risk of a data center developer bringing a legal challenge against the ordinance. If the developer wins that challenge, they must be allowed to develop wherever they please. Municipalities whose ordinances do not allow for data centers remain vulnerable to these challenges up to the moment they formally announce their intention to adopt an ordinance to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; the exclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One township that learned this the hard way is Clifton Township, Lackawanna County. This spring, the township learned of a developer&rsquo;s desire to build a 17-building data center campus on approximately 500 acres in the township, along with another 500 acres in neighboring Covington Township. Much of this property is located in a residential zoning district, and nearly all of it contains uncut forest and Exceptional Value streams and wetlands. Clifton Township&rsquo;s existing zoning ordinance did not address data centers, so the township quickly drafted an amendment that would limit data centers to its Industrial District and impose commonsense restrictions on them. However, mere hours before the township publicly announced its intention to adopt this ordinance, the data center developer submitted a legal challenge to the existing ordinance. By doing so, the developer &ldquo;beat the clock,&rdquo; and Clifton Township now must defend against the challenge. If it loses, it must allow the data center developer to build in the residential zone, regardless of what the new ordinance says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clifton Township&rsquo;s experience can serve as a warning to all Pennsylvania municipalities&mdash;do not wait until a developer is at your door to update your zoning ordinance. Decide NOW how your municipality should regulate these uses if and when they come knocking. PennFuture commends the municipalities in the Poconos that have done just that, including Coolbaugh, Jackson, Chestnuthill, Polk, Clifton, and Covington Townships, and other townships like Kidder, Tobyhanna, and Smithfield that are quickly working toward doing the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As several of these municipalities have acknowledged, their first efforts at data center regulation may not be perfect. Data centers are new uses for most Pennsylvania municipalities, and technological innovations are occurring at a rapid pace. It is very likely that the ordinances adopted this summer will need to be revised and amended in the future as we learn more about how this development will take shape in Pennsylvania. But, municipalities should not let the perfect become the enemy of the good. An imperfect ordinance is better than no ordinance at all!&nbsp;</p>

<p>And municipalities do not have to go at it alone! PennFuture is here to help! Our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Model%2DData%2DCenter%2DOrdinance%281%29.pdf"">model data center ordinance</a> and<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdnx39zyNTg""> video series</a> can help municipalities get up to speed and take action quickly to ensure data center growth is appropriately regulated. We&rsquo;ve done the leg work necessary to produce a thorough and considerate ordinance, reviewing ordinances from PA and other states, considering the impacts of this type of land use, and ensuring sufficient local authority over where this new land use should go.

Here Comes the Sun: PennFuture’s Guide to Planning for Grid-Scale Solar Development,7/9/2025,"<p>Grid-scale solar (large, ground-mounted solar arrays, often referred to as solar farms) is the fastest-growing and least expensive form electric generation in the United States. Pennsylvania has increased its solar power generation by 370% over the past decade, and the future undoubtedly holds even more of this clean, renewable power source. In fact, nearly all of the energy generation projects awaiting approval from PJM, the organization that controls which energy generators can connect to the grid, are grid-scale solar projects.</p>

<p>As the level of government tasked with the job of choosing good locations for all types of land development, municipalities have an important role in ushering in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s bright new energy future. However, many municipalities are considering grid-scale solar for the first time and are in need of information about this type of development in order to make good siting decisions.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why PennFuture created <em>Here Comes the Sun: A Municipal Guide to Grid-Scale Solar Siting</em>. This isn&rsquo;t another model ordinance. Many model ordinances for solar already exist. Instead, this publication aims to give municipalities the background and tools they need to evaluate potential ordinance provisions, learn the truth behind common objections to solar, and appropriately plan for grid-scale solar development.</p>

<p><em>Here Comes the Sun</em> is a comprehensive guide that covers a number of topics of interest to municipalities planning for solar.&nbsp;<br />
These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is grid-scale solar?</li>
	<li>Parts of a grid-scale solar system</li>
	<li>What makes a good site for grid-scale solar</li>
	<li>Tips for improving the legal landscape for grid-scale solar, including analysis of common solar ordinance provisions</li>
	<li>The reality of solar on brownfields, warehouse roofs, and parking lots</li>
	<li>Objections based on grid-scale solar&rsquo;s lack of direct connection to local energy consumers</li>
	<li>The truth behind common myths about grid-scale solar.</li>

We are grateful for all of the hard work, passion, and dedication of our legal interns.&nbsp;<br />
This summer, we have three fantastic students joining us who bring their unique backgrounds and experiences to our mission. We&rsquo;ve asked our new interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</p>

My admiration for our environment began at a young age. Growing up on the Maryland Chesapeake Bay provided me with the opportunity to be immersed in local wildlife and habitat. Observing Great Blue Herons, Bald Eagles, and the notorious Blue Crab was one of my favorite hobbies growing up. This passion inevitably influenced my future.<br />
I pursued law school intending to have a career in environmental law. My interest was solidified through my experiences at Delaware Law. Serving as Treasurer and Co-Founder of the Environmental Law Society and participating as a Clinic Student Attorney in the Environmental and Natural Resources Law Clinic.<br />
PennFuture&rsquo;s fight for &ldquo;clean air, pure water, and climate change solutions&rdquo; encompasses the work I want to be involved in, and I&rsquo;m grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to this mission. I&rsquo;m looking forward to a rewarding summer learning from the environmental legal advocates at PennFuture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Growing up, I have always had a passion for environmentalism. From advocating for the reduction of disposable styrofoam trays at school board meetings to helping organize and operate an e-waste recycling drive, it was always something that I considered my duty as a member of my community.<br />
In college, I majored in chemistry at The College of New Jersey, focusing on sustainable chemistry. I was lucky enough to research solutions to make pharmaceutical storage, transport, and administration more efficient and environmentally conscious. As a rising 3L student at Rutgers Law School in Camden, I have considered environmental law as a career that will enable me to properly serve the public as a whole.<br />
Environmental law is the intersection of many things I enjoy: science, law and policy, and environmentalism. A summer at PennFuture allows me to explore this niche field in a way that is both rewarding and productive!</p>

As a native Pennsylvanian who grew up next to the decommissioned Three Mile Island, I appreciate the balancing of productivity with protecting our environment. I did not enter law school thinking that I would be pursuing Environmental or Energy Law, but their ability to have a direct positive impact on my community by creating a cleaner, safer, and more reliable future makes them a rewarding field.</p>

<p>I am excited to contribute to PennFuture&rsquo;s mission of improving Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment by learning from their esteemed team and helping them tackle the rapidly changing environmental and energy fields. By figuring out how to navigate the shifting regulations, we can make sure that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and citizens can continue to prosper.<br />
At the Columbus School of Law, I have the pleasure of serving as the Treasurer of both the First Generation Law Student Union and the Law and Technology Student Association, where I hope to be able to leverage the ever-adapting technologies to the preservation and improvement of our environment.</p>

Introducing PennFuture’s New Spring Term Legal Intern!,2/18/2025,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.<br />
But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognize that we need to be more involved with cultivating the people that will continue to support our mission. Our staff have a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.&nbsp;<br />
With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting Pennsylvania as well as to further their potential environmental careers. We&rsquo;ve seen success on this front as many of our legal interns have found work in the Pennsylvania environmental legal space. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.&nbsp;<br />

My childhood experiences with frequent power outages in the Philippines sparked my interest in energy and environmental law. The paradox of unreliable electricity and high costs, caused by aging infrastructure, natural disasters, and growing demand, fueled my curiosity. These early challenges inspired my current passion for addressing complex issues at the intersection of energy policy and environmental protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to law school, I worked as a paralegal for several years at one of the nation&rsquo;s leading firms in energy law. That role enabled me to develop a deeper understanding of the federal energy landscape and provided me with invaluable insights into the electric, gas, and oil industries by assisting in sophisticated regulatory matters. As an aspiring litigator, I am eager to apply this practical knowledge to PennFuture&rsquo;s impactful work in creating a more sustainable future for Pennsylvania and learn more about environmental advocacy and policymaking to advance clean energy solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Penn State Dickinson Law, I am actively involved in my community by serving as President of the Women&rsquo;s Law Caucus; Secretary of OutLaw; member of the Moot Court team; Legal Analysis and Writing Teaching Assistant for Prof. Martin; Admissions Ambassador; member of the Student Bar Association Social Committee; and member of the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I was a child I loved to be outdoors and loved helping any animal I came across. It was for this love for the environment and wildlife that I knew from a young age that I wanted to do my part in helping to protect and conserve the environment.</p>

<p>It was this passion that drove me to obtain my undergraduate major in Environmental Science and Policy from the University of South Florida. From courses taken in my undergraduate education and from my strong passion to protect the environment, I was motivated to attend Widener University Commonwealth Law School with the hopes to pursue a career in Environmental Law after graduation. At Widener University Commonwealth Law School, I am a member of the Animal Legal Defense Fund and I am pursuing a Certificate in Environmental Law.</p>

<p>I was drawn to apply as an Intern with PennFuture because I related to PennFutures&rsquo; dedication to protecting the environment and fighting for sustainable communities for generations to come.&nbsp; I also really admired PennFutures&rsquo; efforts to educate and outreach to citizens in Pennsylvania to help empower them to fight for change in our communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interning with PennFuture has given me the ability to expand my knowledge in Environmental Law by sharpening my research and writing skills as well as providing me with opportunities to learn first-hand about the litigation process surrounding current Environmental issues affecting Pennsylvania residents. PennFuture has solidified that Environmental Law is the field of law that I want to go into and has given me the opportunity to work with an organization that prioritizes advancing an environmentally friendly and sustainable community.</p>

<p>Growing up in Lancaster County, I have seen drastic changes in our local environment as forests and farms have been turned into parking lots and strip malls time and time again. Growing up in such a dynamic environment piqued my interest at a young age into environmental issues and political issues in my local community.</p>

<p>These two passions guided my educational journey, enrolling in a dual degree program which coalesced my interests. I received a Bachelor of Arts from the Paris Institute of Political Science and a second bachelor&#39;s degree from Columbia University in Sustainable Development. I never lost sight of home though, for my senior honors thesis I examined the socio-economic impacts of hydraulic fracturing on Pennsylvania&#39;s Northern Tier and continued to be involved with local issues.</p>

<p>After undergrad I joined my municipality&#39;s Sustainable Advisory Committee and became a technical consultant for the private sector helping businesses to achieve and keep compliance with environmental regulations. For two and a half years I inspected factories, collected field samples, wrote reports, and gave staff trainings to help ensure businesses were keeping our environment clean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was ultimately this exposure to environmental regulations that sparked my interest in the law and led me to attend Penn State Dickinson Law where I am currently in my second year. I am tremendously excited to be at PennFuture where all of my passions in life&mdash; the environment, Pennsylvania, and the law come together!&nbsp;</p>

What You Need to Know About Being a Poll Worker,9/24/2024,"<p>Your community needs you! By serving as a poll worker, you will ensure that the voting process runs smoothly on Election Day. It&#39;s an excellent opportunity to connect with your neighbors and play a vital role in the democratic process. Regular citizens who volunteer as poll workers are passionate about civic engagement and get firsthand participation in the inner workings of our electoral system.</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture&rsquo;s Managing Attorney for Litigation Jessica O&rsquo;Neill</strong> shares her experience as an election worker for the past 8 years and <strong>PennFuture&rsquo;s Advocacy Manager Michael Mehrazar</strong> shares his background as a poll worker trainer below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But first, please review the Pennsylvania poll worker criteria:</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Q. Who can be a poll worker?&nbsp;</strong><br />
There are a few requirements to becoming a poll worker in PA.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Generally, poll workers must be registered voters in their county.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Must not hold any public office, appointment or employment in the government.</li>
	<li>Must not be a candidate running for public office on the ballot in precinct (exceptions for Judge and Inspector of elections).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Must be completely non-partisan while serving in the precinct (not campaigning, handing out literature or wearing political items), and must work to keep the rest of the room where voting occurs a &ldquo;campaign free zone.&rdquo; The &ldquo;campaign free zone&rdquo; in the polling place is to ensure that voters are free to cast ballots without influence or intimidation.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You must be patient and a good listener for those showing up to cast a ballot.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>*Special skills like language interpretation or ASL fluency are critical to making the polls and voting as accessible as possible for all.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. I am under 18 years old. Can I be a poll worker?</strong><br />
It varies by location. To check to see if your location accepts student poll workers, please enter your zip code here: <a href=""https://powerthepolls.com/search"">https://powerthepolls.com/search</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. How do I apply to be a poll worker?&nbsp;</strong><br />
You can submit your interest at this link: <a href=""https://powerthepolls.com/cvpa&amp;pf"">https://powerthepolls.com/cvpa&amp;pf</a></p>

<p><strong>Q. When is the deadline to apply to be a poll worker?</strong><br />
Most election administrators accept applications on a rolling basis. Once you submit your interest, your county or jurisdiction will reach out to you on dates for training.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. Do I need to go through specific poll worker training?</strong><br />
Yes. Local jurisdictions can host both in-person and online training events ahead of Election Day and will fully prepare you for your shift. For example, in Pittsburgh, training typically lasts up to 2 hours for new poll workers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. What specific duties&nbsp;are available to poll workers?</strong></p>

<p>The jobs will depend on the county. For example, in <a href=""https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Poll-Workers"">Allegheny County</a>, you can be assigned as Judge of Election, Inspector, or Clerk of Election depending on your skill set.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Will I get paid to be a poll worker?&nbsp;</strong><br />
Many jurisdictions in PA provide compensation for poll workers on election day and for training. Compensation varies by jurisdiction and you can review by submitting your zip code here https://www.powerthepolls.org/search<br />
For example, in Philadelphia, a poll worker who works the full day can receive $200 to $205 for Election Day, and $30 to $50 for training.</p>

<p><strong>Q. When do polls open and close?</strong><br />
In Pennsylvania, the polls open at 7:00 am and close at 8:00 pm.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>I&rsquo;M A POLL WORKER</strong></h2>

<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""align-left"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Jessica.jpg"" style=""width: 480px; height: 580px; float: left;"" /></strong></p>

<p><strong>Q. Why did you want to be a poll worker?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 2016 general election, my polling place was overwhelmed with 3+ hour-long lines to vote. The neighborhood&#39;s population had changed, and many more voters would vote that year using antiquated voting machines and procedures. The few poll workers just couldn&#39;t keep up. They were doing their best, but it was just too much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I watched potential voters leave the lines because they were so long. I vowed to get involved to make sure that even if I couldn&#39;t fix the infrastructure problems, I could help use my skills to make things more efficient and secure and ensure no one would ever walk out of a polling line again.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What was your poll worker training like? How long was your training?</strong></p>

<p>In Philadelphia County, there is in-person and online training. I recommend doing both if you can (both are about a half hour long). Many of the other poll workers will have a lot of experience &mdash; talk to them to learn how everything works! Make sure that you show up an hour before voting begins so you can have time to get the polling place set up and get ready.</p>

<p><strong>Q. On election day, when did you show up to your shift and how long did you work?</strong></p>

<p>There are no shifts &ndash; get ready for a long day! I show up an hour before polls open, which is usually at 5:45 am. As the judge of elections, I am bringing some of the election materials from the county with me, and I want to be there first to be ready to greet my workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a lot to do to set up the polling place, so we launch right into it. I appreciate having poll workers who are willing to just get straight to work even if they have never worked an election before. There are many set up tasks that anyone can do with a little direction!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Polls open in Pennsylvania from 7 am to 8 pm. Anyone who is still in line at 8 pm can vote, and we do not start closing the polls until after 8 pm even if there is no one in line. I usually can excuse my poll workers by 9 pm, but if there is a line, then we are all there longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the judge of elections, I am responsible for the election materials. A police officer comes and picks up the ballots sometime after 8 pm, and I am responsible for bringing other election materials back to the board of elections after we are all closed up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. What did you wear?</strong></p>

<p>Comfortable clothing is a must! Supportive footwear and layers, as the temperature will change a lot through the day depending on how many people are in line in the room! No shirts or other attire supporting a candidate is allowed. I always wear a pin that says &ldquo;Vote!&rdquo; and I have another poll worker with amazing &ldquo;go vote!&rdquo; socks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. Are you allowed to bring anything with you / should you bring something with you (ie. lunch, a book)?</strong></p>

<p>You may get a break so it&rsquo;s a good idea to bring a book or magazine. In Philadelphia, there are various organizations that try to make sure that meals are provided to poll workers throughout the day. It often ends up being a bunch of donuts in the morning and a pizza at dinner. Different counties might have different procedures on meals.</p>

<p><strong>Q. How would you describe your poll worker job on election day? What were your specific tasks?</strong></p>

<p>As the judge of elections, I manage the entire polling place. I ensure that the poll books are correct, that the machines are working, and that my poll workers understand and can do their jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also make sure that election laws are followed &mdash; that folks distributing campaign literature stay the appropriate number of feet outside the polling place, that no voter is being harassed or intimidated, and that election watchers are permitted as provided by law and are following the rules.</p>

<p>Most importantly, though, my job is ensuring registered voters can cast their ballots! If they need to show ID, I make sure they understand why and help them meet the requirements under the law. If they are at the wrong polling place, I help them figure out what polling place they are supposed to be at and make sure they know where to find it. Suppose they aren&rsquo;t permitted to vote on the voting machines (for example, they were issued a mail-in ballot or their name isn&rsquo;t in the poll book). In that case, I make sure they understand why, give them the provisional ballot and the receipt, and follow the appropriate steps to get that provisional ballot in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>My goal is for a registered, eligible voter coming into the polling place can walk out trusting the electoral system and be confident that their vote will be counted.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. Did any problems occur that you helped to solve?</strong></p>

<p>Countless! It&rsquo;s what I do all day long.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What did you like about your job as a poll worker?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I like knowing my neighbors and knowing that they know me as a trustworthy person who helps them vote. My favorite moments throughout the day are when someone brings in their 18-year-old kid to vote for the first time: someone yells out, &ldquo;First-time voter!&rdquo; and all the poll workers cheer and applaud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also have a voter in his 90s who never misses an election, and I get such a kick out of seeing him come in and cast his ballot. My work is a bright spot that makes me feel good about our democracy.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>I WAS A POLL WORKER TRAINER</strong></h2>

<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""align-left"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Michael.jpg"" style=""width: 480px; height: 580px; float: left;"" />Q. Why did you want to be a poll worker?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Ever since childhood, I have been fascinated by the electoral process. I vividly remember my dad taking me into the polling booth when I was eight. This early experience sparked my interest, and it should be no surprise that I went on to study political science in college.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after graduating, I applied for and was fortunate to receive a job at the Anne Arundel County Board of Elections in Maryland. I was honored to secure a position so closely involved with the administration of our electoral system just after completing my studies. This experience helped me lead the way to future electoral and government work, including my role as Advocacy Manager at PennFuture today.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What was your poll worker training like? How long was your training?</strong></p>

<p>I was hired as a trainer to help train citizens interested in becoming Election Judges. Our training program consisted of an intensive two-week overview of all aspects of electoral laws and procedures in Maryland. This involved lectures, written components, and hands-on familiarity with the various election equipment.</p>

<p>After the initial training, we spent another two weeks manually reviewing the voting machines to catch any potential flaws or issues. (2014 was the last election in which Maryland used a touchscreen voting system rather than the more secure paper record voting system. <a href=""https://elections.maryland.gov/voting_system/learn_about_the_new_voting_system.html"">More information here</a>)<br />
We would then spend the remaining time leading up to the election training citizens to become certified election judges. Following the election, we spent several weeks completing the necessary post-election work, including ballot counting, post-operation review, and other administrative tasks.</p>

<p>The training sessions we ran typically lasted around 2 hours. During these sessions, we would review the election judge manual, review the various judge roles (check-in judge, voter judge, provisional judge, and chief judge), and cover the opening procedures, during-the-day procedures, and closing procedures. We would also incorporate role-playing exercises to help prepare the judges.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe our judges were well-trained and equipped to handle their responsibilities on election day.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Any question that you recommend new poll workers ask during training?</strong></p>

<p>I suggest reading ahead of time to ensure you have a sense of the basic procedure during the training. Try to inquire about any potential edge cases or nuances that may arise on Election Day. I&#39;d also recommend asking questions about the measures in place to secure the voting process, as many unfounded concerns are circulating about election integrity, and it would be great to know the accurate information to help mitigate those fears.</p>

<p><strong>Q. On election day, when did you show up to your shift and how long did you work?</strong></p>

<p>As a trainer, my role on election day was to observe multiple polling places and ensure proper procedures were followed. I was also on call in case any serious issues arose. My day began at 6:00 am and did not end until close to midnight, as I was responsible for processing all the materials, including the computer cards that held the votes.</p>

<p>For most polling workers, however, the day typically started about half an hour before the polls opened and ended about half an hour after the polls closed (roughly 6:30 am to 8:30 pm).</p>

<p><strong>Q. What did you wear?</strong></p>

<p>We had a uniform, which included a black polo and khakis. I don&rsquo;t think most places have a specific dress code for election judges, but I&rsquo;m not sure. Whatever you wear, make sure it&rsquo;s comfortable &mdash; it&rsquo;s a long day!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. Are you allowed to bring anything with you / should you bring something with you (ie. lunch, a book)?</strong></p>

<p>I believe you&rsquo;re allowed to bring food. Books would be fine too, as long as they weren&rsquo;t political in nature or in favor of any of the candidates. I would certainly ask your trainers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. How would you describe your poll worker job on election day? What were your specific tasks?</strong></p>

<p>Back in 2014 in Maryland, there were four different poll worker roles:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Check-in Judges: These judges check voters&#39; names against the registration list to verify they were at the correct polling location. They would also help direct voters to the appropriate polling place or inform them if they needed to cast a provisional ballot.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Voting Judges: These judges would guide voters to the voting machines and assist them with any questions or issues they encounter during the voting process.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Provisional Judges: These judges would staff the provisional ballot station, handling ballots for voters who faced eligibility issues that prevented them from casting a regular ballot. If the voter&#39;s eligibility was later confirmed within the allotted time frame (typically 10 days), their provisional ballot would be counted.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Chief Judges: The chief judges were responsible for managing the overall operations of the polling place. Typically, they are election day veterans, having run many elections before. They are required to be bipartisan, with one Democrat and one Republican serving together. On election night, the chief judges would also be tasked with delivering the voting equipment to the Board of Elections.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. Did any problems occur that you helped to solve?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there were various logistical issues, such as signs not being placed in the right locations, people campaigning too close to the polling places, and check-in computers needing to be fixed. No matter how much training is provided, things rarely go perfectly on election day.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. What did you like about your job as a poll worker?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides the camaraderie I had with my team, I found it fascinating to learn about the significant behind-the-scenes efforts that go into securing our elections. These efforts, often unnoticed by the general public, involve numerous security measures such as tamper-evident seals, serial number matching, locked bags, and the presence of bipartisan poll watchers. This learning experience has deepened my understanding of the integrity and fairness of our elections.</p>

Kidder Township Adopts PennFuture Model Logistics Ordinance Over Objections of Distribution Center Developer,9/16/2024,"<p><img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Route%2D940%2DKidder%2DTwp%2DWarehouse%284%29.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px; float: right;"" />Kidder Township is the quintessential Poconos community. It is home to Hickory Run State Park, Jack Frost and Big Boulder ski resorts, Lake Harmony, thousands of acres of state game land, and countless Special Protection waters and wetlands, including the headwaters of the Lehigh River. But, in recent years, residents have witnessed an unwelcome shift in the landscape. It began in 2023 with the construction of a 1.1 million square foot distribution center that converted 45 acres of woodland in the Lehigh River watershed to impervious surface. Later that year, the Township approved a second massive distribution center along the same road. Within weeks of that approval, the Township received plans for a third project, a 420,000 square foot warehouse across the road from the first building that would pave over an additional 46 acres of forest.</p>

<p>With no end to the destruction of their precious natural resources in sight, Kidder Township residents sprung into action. Local advocacy groups LOVE Kidder Township and Save Carbon County rallied concerned community members to stop the unrestrained development of massive logistics facilities. They waded into the complex world of local and state land use approval processes and organized members to attend meetings and communicate their concerns to local and state decision-makers. They engaged an engineer to review the most recent warehouse proposal and identify key environmental issues. Most importantly, they did not just offer resistance and antagonism&ndash;they offered solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As LOVE Kidder Township and Save Carbon County quickly realized, the explosion of massive logistics facilities in Kidder Township was facilitated by the Township&rsquo;s overly-permissive zoning ordinance. Under the existing ordinance, warehouses, distribution centers, and truck terminals (as these types of facilities are variously called) were all allowed as permitted uses in the Township&rsquo;s commercial and business/light industrial zoning districts. Few, if any, restrictions applied to these uses beyond basic lot size and setback requirements. The absence of more stringent requirements or a public review process meant that Township officials had little ability to reign in massive logistics development, even if they and the residents wanted to. The advocacy groups came to understand that, if residents and the Township wanted more say in what was built in their community, they needed more robust zoning regulations. For help in crafting those regulations, Kidder Township residents turned to PennFuture.</p>

<p>Through the advocacy of LOVE Kidder Township and Save Carbon County, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Publications/PennFuture_Ordinance_Manual_7.pdf""><em>Living with Logistics</em></a>, PennFuture&rsquo;s model logistics use ordinance and guidebook, became the blueprint for Kidder Township&rsquo;s reconsideration of its zoning ordinance, and on September 12, 2024, the Board of Supervisors adopted a zoning ordinance amendment that imposes new, more appropriate restrictions based on PennFuture&rsquo;s model.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""align-left"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Route%2D940%2DKidder%2DTwp%2DWarehouse%281%29.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px; float: left;"" /><strong>Perhaps the most significant change to the Kidder Township zoning ordinance is that all logistics uses are now conditional uses and allowed only in the Business Development/Light Industrial District.</strong> Designating these uses as conditional uses instead of allowing them &ldquo;by-right&rdquo; means that applicants will now have to prove, at a public hearing before the Board of Supervisors, that their proposed warehouse/distribution center/truck terminal satisfies the requirements of the zoning ordinance. These hearings will also provide an opportunity for the public to question applicants about their proposals and, if they so desire, to present their own evidence. The conditional use process also allows the Board of Supervisors to impose conditions upon approval, an option that is not available for &ldquo;by-right&rdquo; uses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kidder Township&rsquo;s new ordinance also adopts many of the other provisions suggested in PennFuture&rsquo;s model. For example, using language provided by PennFuture, the ordinance prohibits the removal of more than 50% of the woodland on any given site, creates riparian buffers, requires developers to submit Environmental Impact Statements, and obligates developers of high traffic-volume facilities to provide overnight parking and other driver facilities. Township officials also made changes to the model ordinance language as they saw fit, as was entirely appropriate. For example, the Township reduced the suggested building setbacks and opted to forgo language offering developers credit for using impervious pavement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The path to adoption was not without obstacles. Blue Ridge Real Estate (BRRE), the entity that developed the existing 1.1 million square-foot distribution center and seeks approval for a second facility across the street (and owns dozens of additional parcels in the Township) vehemently opposed the ordinance amendment. Realizing that the ordinance amendment would spell the end of relatively unconstrained warehouse and distribution center development, BRRE incorrectly branded the amendment as unconstitutional and erroneously claimed that it would render some of its properties undevelopable. The Board of Supervisors was not swayed by these scare tactics, however, and concluded that the new ordinance strikes an appropriate balance between the Township&rsquo;s economic interests and protecting its sensitive environmental areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As LOVE Kidder Township and Save Carbon County have shown, residents who join together and present solutions to local environmental concerns can make big changes in the shape of their community. Kidder Township now joins the growing number of municipalities to adopt PennFuture&rsquo;s model ordinance or portions thereof, including Palmer Township, Northampton County, and Coolbaugh Township, Monroe County. PennFuture is proud to offer the resources to help municipalities in this important work.</p>

Shifting the Paradigm for a Sustainable Pennsylvania Economy,8/12/2024,"<p>Climate change is the greatest existential threat to humanity and the worst market failure of our time. Economic volatility and environmental degradation are inherent to the fossil industries, whose greenhouse gas emissions caused the climate crisis that impacts us today. Pennsylvania has been uniquely impacted as these extractive industries established a dysfunctional economy driven by boom and bust cycles, which leads to instability and uncertainty for workers and communities across the state. This situation is unsustainable.</p>

<p>How do we transition Pennsylvania to clean energy sources after centuries of dependence upon fossil fuels? What would the necessary transition and resulting economy look like?&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s explore the notions of sustainability and sustainable economics.</p>

<h3><strong>What is &quot;sustainability&quot;?</strong></h3>

<p>&quot;Enough for everyone forever&quot; is considered the guiding principle of sustainability. The concept demands that we meet the needs of now without sacrificing future generations&#39; quality of life and opportunities. It is both a challenge and a hopeful sentiment of what is possible. It is something enshrined in <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/environmental-rights-amendment"">our constitutional environmental rights as Pennsylvanians</a> and something to fight for.</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Sustainability%2DCompass.jpg"" style=""width: 340px; height: 285px; float: right;"" /></p>

<p>According to sustainability expert Alan AtKisson: &quot;Sustainability is a concept, a way of thinking, a way of analyzing and understanding&quot; (<a href=""https://sforeveryone.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sustainability-is-for-everyone-alan-atkisson.pdf"">Sustainability is for Everyone</a>). It includes two important aspects - (1) long-term thinking and (2) systems thinking. Long-term thinking requires careful consideration of data, information, and trends with a specific plan or goal in mind. It requires us to have a vision. This thinking differs significantly from the short-term, profit-driven motivations driving our economy. While the sustainability framework asks, &quot;Will this help us to have enough for everyone forever,&quot; our current economic approach instead asks, &quot;Will this maximize profits for shareholders now?&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Systems thinking acknowledges the connectedness of sustainability. Our society and economic well-being rely upon complex and nuanced systems - planetary ecosystems and the economy - which we tend to collapse and oversimplify. We have learned to separate economies from ecosystems as if our lives do not depend upon both. One provides income, goods, and services. The other includes air, water, and food. Inevitably, the choices made and actions taken in one of these realms impact other parts and functions of the system. Analyzing data and considering trade-offs carefully provides opportunities to mitigate the severity of any potential consequences, like pollution or economic volatility. It ultimately allows us to make more informed choices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One final piece of the sustainability puzzle is diversity, which enhances resilience amid shocks and disruptions. For example, when a local economy relies upon a single industry - like a coal-fired power plant - and that industry collapses, so does the community. Consequently, that community is hard-pressed to bounce back after such a shock and economic loss because its workforce, tax base, and way of life were structured around that industry. But when a local economy is diverse - it may include outdoor recreation, hospitality, small contractors, research and development, higher education, etc. - the shock can be absorbed because other employment opportunities, sources of tax revenue, and cultural identity exist. Similarly, a diverse economy can also be more resilient to natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, or wildfires. As the old saying goes, you shouldn&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket.</p>

<h3><strong>What makes an economy sustainable?</strong></h3>

<p>A sustainable economy serves current society&#39;s social and economic interests while protecting the natural environment. By striking this balance, future generations will have ample access to economic opportunities. They will not be robbed of health, well-being, and the stable planetary ecosystem necessary for society to function. Sustainability means stability. Stability is vital to sustainability because, without it, economic decisions narrow down to a short-term framework that can lead to reactionary policies and actions. We lose the vision and goals that keep us focused on not just the now but on the future.&nbsp; In other words, for sustainable economics and long-term thinking and planning to be successful, some level of economic stability must be achieved.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Green%2DEconomy.JPG"" style=""width: 387px; height: 281px; float: right;"" /></p>

<p>Because a sustainable economy balances social and economic interests, it values quality of life, work, and health outcomes for communities. This valuation asks questions like &quot;Whose needs are being considered?&quot; and &quot;Whose needs are being ignored?&quot;; and &quot;Which variables are considered &quot;costs&quot; in the decision-making process?&quot;. In other words, sustainability aims to reduce the negative externalities (harms) while elevating and enhancing the positive externalities (benefits) created by decisions made.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frequently, companies and businesses argue that regulations hurt their bottom line. Yet, it is rare for them to admit when policies and regulations allow them to &quot;externalize&quot; costs, or in other words, place their business&#39;s physical and economic burdens onto the workforce and local communities rather than preventing or mitigating those harms in the first place. Such externalities include poor air quality, water pollution, or low wages. Here in Pennsylvania, a clear example of industry externalizing their costs is how oil and gas drillers abandon their wells when they are no longer &quot;productive&quot;, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-Environmental-Groups-Sue-Pennsylvanias-General-Assembly-and-Governor-Josh-Shapiro-for-Not-Holding-Oil-Gas-Companies-Accountable-for-Abandoned-Wells"">leaving the taxpayers on the financial hook</a> to clean up their mess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, sustainable businesses would enhance quality of life by reducing pollution, improving air quality, and providing quality jobs that offer opportunities for professional growth and higher wages. Ideally, the cycle continues - <a href=""https://www.pawildscenter.org/programs-and-services/studies-reports/"">improving quality of life improves environmental health, attracting businesses and a competitive workforce</a>. Sustainability results in a positive feedback loop, in contrast to what fossil fuels offer, which includes environmental degradation, market volatility, and unstable employment.</p>

<h3><strong>How do we move Pennsylvania toward a sustainable economy?</strong></h3>

<p>To create a more sustainable economy in Pennsylvania, we must explore how we can generate economic activity, protect the environment, and enhance quality of life while using our natural resources more efficiently. This exploration will lead us to identify products, services, and processes that reduce or limit environmental harm. Of course, this new economy&#39;s foundation requires clean energy, clean tech for production processes, and an energy-efficient industry.</p>

<p>This shift in strategy will be challenging in Pennsylvania because fossil fuels are entrenched in our economy and culture. But change is possible. Communities are beginning to <a href=""https://www.shalepalwv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-Re-Imagine-Beaver-County-Book.pdf"">re-envision a future</a> that is less reliant on dirty energy and more focused on quality of life. Momentum is building. Communities are eager for a path forward. Decision-makers and policy experts need to develop that path.</p>

<p>While the environmental movement relies heavily upon regulation, it alone will not transition us to a sustainable economy. We must also create and utilize economic policies that incentivize and establish preferences for clean energy, clean tech, energy efficiency, and sustainable businesses (e.g., &quot;green collar jobs&quot;).</p>

<p>State policy is a great place to focus our efforts because increasing sustainability on a local and regional level is foundational to success. Building local capacity for sustainable business and industry increases support for local-serving economic activities (i.e., businesses that do not export their goods or services). This support is vital because:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>High quality of life attracts and retains businesses and workers,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Local services support industry clusters, local services - like education and health care - play critical roles in communities and are considered public goods,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>And providing services locally is more efficient and cost-effective, as compared to importing them. (<a href=""https://communityinnovation.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/defining_the_green_economy_a_primer_on_green_economic_development.pdf?width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true"">Defining the Green Economy</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Green%2DPolicies.JPG"" style=""width: 302px; height: 236px; float: right;"" /></p>

<p>Thus, to move Pennsylvania towards a more sustainable economy, it will take the creation and utilization of standards, regulations, incentives, technical assistance, and marketing programs combined with supportive economic policies that can include options like local purchasing requirements, local hiring requirements, labor standards, and provisions that allow agencies to clawback funds when standards are not met.</p>

<p>As we outline in our latest report, &quot;<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PF%5FDCED%5FReport%5F5.pdf"">Economic Policy IS Environmental Policy: Prioritizing Environmental Progress in Pennsylvania&#39;s Department of Community and Economic Development</a>&quot;, there are concrete steps like these that our state decision-makers should take to move towards a more sustainable economy. It begins by reforming key state agencies, like the DCED so that the development and deployment of renewable energy and cleantech manufacturing are prioritized utilizing the financial tools already at our disposal. This agency, in particular, has the potential to leverage its private sector influence to effectively facilitate Pennsylvania&#39;s transition to a sustainable economy fueled by renewable energy. When reshaping our economy, the government has a great deal of influence. In Pennsylvania, that influence should be redirected towards renewables and cleantech to support a stable and sustainable economy for all.</p>

<h3><strong>What would a more sustainable future look like for Pennsylvania?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>If we take a look at the long-term and systems thinking that creates sustainability and apply that to Pennsylvania, a sustainable economy should include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cleantech manufacturing revitalizes economically distressed communities;</li>
	<li>R&amp;D, biotech, and life sciences industries expanding economic opportunities in rural regions;</li>
	<li>Facilities fueled by renewable energy, which was developed and installed by local contractors;</li>
	<li>Energy assessment and energy efficiency efforts reduce home heating and cooling costs;</li>
	<li>State and local governments attracting and obtaining funding to support low-income residents&#39; efforts to weatherize their homes and</li>
	<li>Stronger and more resilient supply chains that are regionally based and reduce energy and material waste.</li>
</ul>

<p>This vision can become a reality. Making it happen requires understanding the complex and nuanced systems that create the framework for our economy. It also demands that our decision-makers be visionaries willing to lead.</p>

<h3><strong>We cannot wait.</strong></h3>

<p>In the past, our inability to address the crises of our economic and environmental systems has led to an endless cycle of temporary &quot;recoveries&quot; in various industries and the greater economy, leaving workers and families to struggle in their wake. While we must recognize that economics is a critical decision-making factor when planning or responding to a crisis, it should not be the only factor. Historically, the economic argument has been to allow the market to dictate which solutions and mitigations of the crisis are viable and appropriate. Waiting for the market has <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/without-government-the-marketplace-will-not-solve-climate-change/"">wasted precious time</a> and distracted decision-makers, ultimately delaying progress. At the same time, the window of opportunity and the number of options to address the climate crisis narrows. We show deference to market imperatives at our planetary peril.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is time that we re-envision our economy in a way that prioritizes economic stability and community health. We must reduce economic volatility and environmental pollution and create an alternative vision for our future. We should not rely on what harms us to provide our livelihoods, goods, and services. Sustainability offers another way, and PennFuture is committed to helping realize that future.</p>

How Recent US Supreme Court Decisions Harm Environmental Protection,8/2/2024,"<p>While PennFuture&rsquo;s recent <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PA-Supreme-Court-Grants-Intervention-to-Environmental-Organizations-in-RGGI-Litigation"">success</a> with the Environmental Rights Amendment from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is good news for public health and the environment, some very bad decisions being handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court show the fight is far from over. Our legal team <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PA-and-a-Post-Chevron-World"">summarized</a> perhaps the biggest recent threat to environmental law in the nation with the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in the <em>Loper Bright</em> case which overturned decades of legal precedent that gave the scientists, doctors, and experts at federal administrative agencies deference in developing regulations that protect the health and safety of our communities and environment. But there are a few other Supreme Court decisions that we wanted to call your attention to that continue to dismantle the power of administrative agencies and open the door to new challenges of settled laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>No real time limits to challenge federal regulations&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>First up, we have <em>Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Resrv. Sys.</em>, 603 U.S. ____ (2024). In this decision, the one-two punch just days after <em>Loper Bright</em>, the Supreme Court eradicated our ability to rely on seemingly settled federal regulations. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a party has six years to challenge a final agency action (e.g., rule, regulation, policy decision) that is issued by an administrative agency. This is known as the &ldquo;statute of limitations&rdquo;; after that time runs, you cannot challenge the final agency action in court. But what the Supreme Court did in <em>Corner Post</em> is significantly shift the time when this statute of limitations begins to run. So, the six years no longer starts when an agency publishes a final rule or regulation (a known, set date), but instead starts when a would-be challenger is first harmed by a rule. This means that an interest that wants to challenge a rule, whether it was issued 1 year, 10 years, or 40 years ago, can create a new entity (corporation) for the sole purpose of being &ldquo;injured&rdquo; by that regulation, and boom&mdash;they can have their day in court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson summarized the dire place in which we now find ourselves in her dissenting opinion:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tsunami of lawsuits against agencies that the Court&rsquo;s holdings [<em>Corner Post</em>] and <em>Loper Bright</em> have authorized has the potential to devastate the functioning of the Federal Government. Even more to the present point, that result simply cannot be what Congress intended when it enacted legislation that stood up and funded federal agencies and vested them with authority to set the ground rules for the individuals and entities that participate in our economy and our society. It is utterly inconceivable that [the APA&rsquo;s] statute of limitations was meant to permit fresh attacks on settled regulations from all newcomers forever. Yet, that is what the majority holds today.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, when taken together with the dissolving of agency deference in <em>Loper Bright</em>, no federal rule or regulation is sacred anymore. The regulations we rely on to reduce carbon emissions and toxic air pollutants, to ensure healthy indoor air quality, to keep harmful bacteria, PFAS, and other harmful pollution out of our drinking water&mdash;they could all be challenged by industry at any time, leaving our communities and future generations in peril. Let the chaos monkeys reign!&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Administrative tribunal declared unconstitutional, limiting agency enforcement options</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>As if that isn&rsquo;t enough, <em>SEC v. Jarkesy</em>, 603 U.S. ____ (2024), makes it more difficult to hold those who violate rules accountable. Although this case is specifically about the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ultimate holding is likely to impact other federal administrative agencies, like the EPA, who have the authority to bring enforcement actions before in-house administrative tribunals instead of in federal court. We are all familiar with our court system, but what many may not realize is that there are also administrative tribunals that are overseen by administrative law judges (ALJs). (EPA, for example, has an Office of Administrative Law Judges.) ALJs conduct hearings and issue decisions in proceedings between an administrative agency and persons, businesses, government entities, and other organizations that are, or are alleged to be, regulated under the laws that the agency is tasked with promulgating and enforcing. The ALJs have unique expertise in their respective fields and are therefore very well situated to hear challenges to highly technical and complicated legal matters in areas such as environmental, financial, labor, and health and safety law. While decisions of ALJs are appealable to the courts, they provide the trial-level and first-level appellate reviews of these technical matters and agency decisions. In the <em>Jarkesy</em> case for example, the SEC brought a civil (as opposed to criminal) action against <em>Jarkesy</em> and his hedge fund alleging mismanagement of funds controlling $24 million. After an extensive evidentiary hearing, the SEC ALJs found Jarkesy liable for securities fraud and ordered him to pay $300,000 in penalties and sanctions for his actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, the Supreme Court agreed with an extreme opinion by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, that held ALJs and administrative tribunals are unconstitutional. In short, the Supreme Court held that these civil administrative tribunal actions violate the Seventh Amendment&rsquo;s guarantee of a right to a trial by jury in most civil lawsuits, and that the &ldquo;public rights&rdquo; exception does not apply to punitive (e.g., enforcement) actions (the Supreme Court did not rule on the 5th Circuit&rsquo;s other two unconstitutional points: the non-delegation doctrine and separation of powers).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The likelihood of this decision being limited to the SEC&rsquo;s administrative tribunal is very small, meaning that every federal administrative agency tribunal court could similarly be declared unconstitutional. As Justice Sonya Sotomayor points out in her dissent, &ldquo;the Constitutionality of hundreds of statutes may now be in peril, and dozens of agencies could be stripped of their power to enforce laws enacted by Congress.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s more, some administrative agencies, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, are only statutorily authorized to bring enforcement actions through these in-house tribunals. In those situations, it is unclear what will happen. But perhaps the real threat of the <em>Jarkesy</em> decision, especially to environmental law, is that it is extremely resource-intensive to bring litigation in federal courts and, therefore, many agencies may need to triage the enforcement actions they are able to bring. This will ultimately result in less enforcement against polluters and more unchecked harm to our communities and environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The stripping away of administrative agency authority</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>What is painfully clear from this trifecta of recent Supreme Court cases is that it will be harder for administrative agencies that are entrusted with the protection of our environment, our health, and our safety to do their jobs. There will be more litigation in the federal courts challenging strong regulations and this will take significant time and money and will distract resources away from the agencies&rsquo; ability to hold bad actors accountable. It will also make the job of environmental advocates and attorneys, like PennFuture, harder&mdash;and yet more important. As we announced previously: At PennFuture, our legal team will continue to push for strong federal and state regulations to protect our air and water and to continue to beat back against the ravages of climate change.

PA and a Post “Chevron” World,7/10/2024,"<p>On June 28, 2024, the United States Supreme Court issued a <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf"">decision</a> in <em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimando, 603 U.S. ___ (2024)</em>, overturning the long-standing precedent of <em>Chevron v. NRDC</em> from 1984. In response, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFutures-Statement-on-SCOTUS-Overruling-Chevron-Doctrine"">PennFuture said</a> that &ldquo;Chevron has stood for the foundational idea that certain issues are technical, nuanced, and require high levels of expertise that are beyond the knowledge of an individual judge&hellip; the real-world impacts of this [Loper Bright] decision will be far-reaching and will result in harm to our communities, especially those most at risk, and our environment.&rdquo; In this blog, PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team will explain the history and context of the <em>Chevron</em> decision, explain the <em>Loper Bright</em> decision, and look at what this major change in the law means for environmental and human health protections in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Background&nbsp;</h2>

<p>To understand the significance of the <em>Chevron</em> and <em>Loper Bright</em> decisions, let&rsquo;s start with some background about the relationship between Congress and federal agencies. Congress&rsquo;s primary responsibility is enacting federal laws called statutes. Many statutes&mdash;for instance, environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act&mdash;address complex issues. Congress identifies broad concerns and generally directs how they should be addressed. Still, it typically lacks the time and expertise to put into a statute every detail about how to address the problem. Moreover, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for Congress to enshrine that level of detail in a statute when such details and the methods available to address those concerns or problems may change over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where the federal agencies and regulations come in. Rather than attempting to address every aspect of, say, air pollution or securities fraud in a statute, Congress delegates that responsibility to the federal agency responsible for administering that statute. For example, when the Clean Air Act (CAA) was passed, Congress decided that air pollution should be controlled and that one of the ways to do that would be to require persons who create sources of air pollution to obtain permits. However, Congress did not exhaustively list all possible pollutants or get into the details to determine precisely how much of each pollutant each permittee should be allowed to emit. Instead, Congress directed the EPA to create regulations to cover these specifics within the parameters set out by the statute. This approach not only places the development of specific standards in the hands of experts, the &ldquo;masters of the subject,&rdquo; but it also allows agencies&rsquo; interpretations to shift over time (e.g., if a new pollutant is discovered or a new technology allows for greater pollution reduction) without requiring constant amendments to the statute.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this approach makes sense, given the different roles and expertise levels of Congress and the various federal agencies, it can sometimes lead to disputes about whether an agency&rsquo;s interpretation faithfully executes what Congress contemplated when enacting the statute. In <em>Chevron</em>, the Supreme Court provided a way to answer that question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What was the Chevron decision, and how did it come about?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>In the early 1970s, a group of corporate-backed &ldquo;think tanks,&rdquo; including the Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers, and others, <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/684818?mag=why-reagan-became-the-great-deregulator&amp;seq=8"">launched a campaign</a> to restructure our government. These groups had a significant influence on Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s policies, and when he became president in 1981, a seismic wave of deregulation began, reshaping the landscape of our government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One small, seemingly insignificant footnote to this campaign was a rule change at the EPA, spearheaded by Reagan&rsquo;s appointee as EPA Administrator, Anne Gorsuch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While permitting requirements in the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments required certain standards for &ldquo;sources&rdquo; that increased their emissions, the EPA under Gorsuch sought to limit the law&rsquo;s applicability. It decided that a new or modified source, like a boiler or a furnace, could increase emissions without triggering these requirements, provided the facility where it was installed didn&rsquo;t have a net increase in emissions. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) fought this decision all the way to the Supreme Court, and in 1984, the Gorsuch EPA won.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled that if the language of an agency&#39;s enabling legislation (that is, the federal statute like the Clean Air Act in this case) is ambiguous, courts will defer to the agency&#39;s &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; interpretation. Known to generations of law students as &ldquo;the <em>Chevron</em> two-step,&rdquo; it stood for the proposition that the professionals at administrative agencies, like the EPA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and many others are better situated than the courts to understand and implement the complex laws passed by our Congress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;two-step&rdquo; framework works like this:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>In step 1, the court reviewing the challenge to the agency regulation decides if the statute is ambiguous, meaning the court evaluates if Congress clearly directed the agency to do a specific thing or if it left open something for the agency to decide.&nbsp; If the court finds that the statute is unambiguous, then the agency must do what the statute unambiguously directs.&nbsp; If the court finds that the statute is ambiguous, the Court moves to step 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In step 2, the court evaluates if the agency&rsquo;s interpretation of the statute is reasonable.&nbsp; If the court finds that the agency&rsquo;s interpretation is reasonable, then it defers to the agency.&nbsp; Even if the parties argue, for example, that the agency&rsquo;s interpretation is a bad idea or represents a bad policy, the court will uphold the agency&rsquo;s determination under the statute so long as it is a reasonable interpretation of the language Congress wrote.&nbsp; This is known as &ldquo;Chevron deference.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Forty Years of Chevron&nbsp;</h2>

<p>While little notice was given when it was decided, <em>Chevron</em> would become a core foundation of administrative law, especially critical in environmental law, and one of the most-cited decisions ever. At first, the corporate interests that won in <em>Chevron</em> were happy to see the decision used to limit regulation. In 1985, a young attorney named Samuel Alito (yup, that Samuel Alito) even won a case on behalf of the Chemical Manufacturers Association that relied, in part, on <em>Chevron</em>. (Chemical Manufacturers Assoc. v. NRDC, 470 U.S. 116 (1985)). However, the embrace of <em>Chevron</em> by corporate interests didn&rsquo;t last once it became clear that the &ldquo;Chevron deference&rdquo; could support the creation of needed rules just as easily as it had shepherded the Reagan-era deregulation. Many of the same interests that supported the deregulation that gave us <em>Chevron</em> began a new campaign to overrule the decision. Even Neil Gorsuch&mdash;yup, son of the Reagan EPA&rsquo;s Anne Gorsuch, whose actions led to <em>Chevron</em>&mdash;railed against the powers it added to the &ldquo;already titanic administrative state.&rdquo; (<em>Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch</em>, 834 F.3d 1142, 1155 (10th Cir. 2016) (Gorsuch, J., concurring)).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/supreme%2Dcourt%2Dof%2Dthe%2Dunited%2Dstates%2Droberts%2Dcourt%2D2022%2Df051bd.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<h2>From herrings to judicial power: what happened in Loper Bright?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Alito and Gorsuch, after becoming Supreme Court Justices themselves, both joined with the other conservative justices in a 6-3 vote to overrule <em>Chevron</em> in <em>Loper Bright</em>. The case started as a seemingly minor dispute in which a herring fishing company did not want to pay the costs of required federal monitors assigned to their boats. But it became the backdrop for a larger dispute where the Supreme Court asserted its own authority, and that of the judicial branch, over that of the Executive branch&rsquo;s administrative agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A quick summary of the facts of the case that got us here: <em>Loper Bright</em> involves regulations passed by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the federal agency responsible for conserving and maintaining the United States ocean resources, including fisheries. This authority comes from a statute called the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA). To accomplish the MSA&rsquo;s fishery conservation and management goals, NMFS requires certain fishing vessels to carry NMFS &ldquo;observers&rdquo; on board &ldquo;for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation and management of the fishery.&rdquo; Certain of these vessels also must cover the costs of carrying the observers. Loper Bright Enterprises and other fishing companies challenged the regulation, saying it exceeded what Congress authorized the NMFS to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court took the case as the opportunity to revisit <em>Chevron </em>and what happens when Congress leaves ambiguity in a statute. The conservative majority decided that <em>Chevron</em> must be overruled because, it claimed, interpretation of statutes is solely the courts&#39; responsibility. In the majority&rsquo;s view, &ldquo;agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities,&rdquo; and statutory interpretation should not be &ldquo;fundamentally different just because an administrative interpretation is in play.&rdquo; It claimed that <em>Chevron</em>&rsquo;s &ldquo;justifying presumption&rdquo;&mdash;that agencies with the subject matter expertise are suited to interpret ambiguous statutes that they administer&mdash;was &ldquo;a fiction.&rdquo; Therefore, while courts may look to agencies&rsquo; interpretations of statutes for aid and guidance, they are not to defer to those interpretations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>(As for the question of the fishing vessels, the Court sent the case back to the lower courts to decide whether the MSA authorized the NMFS to require vessels to carry and pay for observers without giving deference to the NMFS&rsquo;s interpretation.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>In her dissent, Justice Kagan paints a different picture when a choice must be made. &ldquo;Who should give content to a statute when Congress&rsquo;s instructions have run out?&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;Should it be a court? Or should it be the agency Congress has charged with administering the statute? The answer <em>Chevron</em> gives is that it should usually be the agency, within the bounds of reasonableness.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Objecting to the majority&rsquo;s theory that agencies have no special competence in resolving ambiguities, Justice Kagan goes on to explain why they are the best suited to do so:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some interpretive issues arising in the regulatory context involve scientific or technical subject matter. Agencies have expertise in those areas; courts do not. Some demand a detailed understanding of complex and interdependent regulatory programs. Agencies know those programs inside-out; again, courts do not. And some present policy choices, including trade-offs between competing goods. Agencies report to a President, who in turn answers to the public for his policy calls; courts have no such accountability and no proper basis for making policy. And of course Congress has conferred on that expert, experienced, and politically accountable agency the authority to administer&mdash;to make rules about and otherwise implement&mdash;the statute giving rise to the ambiguity or gap.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Chief Justice Roberts, in his opinion, establishes a new standard that, should a court find that the language Congress wrote reasonably allows for more than one course of action, the path chosen by an agency must not only be reasonable but also the course of action that the court would have chosen. Roberts claims that to do otherwise violates the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) requirement that the court &ldquo;decide all relevant questions of law.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that justification is problematic.&nbsp; First, Chief Justice Roberts omitted the first part of that sentence, in which the APA says the courts should decide questions of law only &ldquo;to the extent necessary.&rdquo; Secondly, if this approach were actually required by the APA, there would have been no need for the court to invent the &ldquo;major questions doctrine&rdquo; which Roberts himself used in <em>West Virginia v. EPA</em> in 2022.&nbsp; (Under the major questions doctrine, courts may find that Congress did not delegate the power to address major political or economic issues to executive agencies, even if the statute&#39;s plain language appears to do just that.) Debates over regulatory language aside, if the language Congress wrote reasonably allows for more than one course of action, which of the reasonable alternatives to pick is a policy question, not a &ldquo;question of law.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not surprising court watchers have referred to Robert&rsquo;s opinion in <em>Loper Bright</em> as <a href=""https://www.thenation.com/article/society/chevron-deference-supreme-court-power-grab/"">&ldquo;the biggest judicial power grab since 1803.&rdquo;&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Loper Bright and the Environment: What is in jeopardy?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Since 1984, courts have applied the <em>Chevron</em> doctrine in thousands of cases. While the <em>Loper Bright</em> ruling doesn&rsquo;t automatically invalidate those prior decisions, it will likely spawn a wave of litigation that could conceivably affect all our administrative agencies, thus putting decades of environmental and health protections at risk. Even where agency action is ultimately upheld, the costs of such litigation could be substantial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rules related to environmental protection and our response to the climate crisis are particularly at risk in these challenges. In particular, there are two recent climate-related regulations that we&rsquo;ve been tracking:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>In March of 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved new rules requiring companies to disclose material climate-related risks to investors.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In April of 2024, the EPA issued New Source Performance Standards for carbon pollution from power plants.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, as we&rsquo;ll discuss in another blog, the Supreme Court also just blew wide open the ability of entities to challenge seemingly &ldquo;safe&rdquo;, decades-old agency regulations under the APA. Coupled with <em>Loper Bright</em>, we must now be prepared for an onslaught of challenges to regulations that our communities have long relied upon for clean air and safe water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/49525429808%5Faabef569a6%5Fc.jpg"" style=""width: 799px; height: 533px;"" /></p>

<h2>What does it mean for Pennsylvania&hellip;&nbsp;</h2>

<p>While the decision in <em>Loper Bright</em> is likely to significantly harm EPA&rsquo;s ability to protect public health and the environment at the federal level, its effect on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is less direct.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Certainly, losing the backstop of strong federal regulations will create challenges for the DEP. The politics of enacting new regulations is much easier when the DEP implements a federal rule than when it acts on its own initiative. There are even restrictions in PA laws that prohibit the DEP, in certain specific cases, from enacting regulations more stringent than the minimum federal requirements without specific justification. Thus, should challenges under this new standard erode federal protections, DEP&rsquo;s hands may be tied to maintain the status quo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also cases, such as establishing motor vehicle emissions standards, where federal law prohibits PA from creating standards. In that case, we can choose between the federal and more protective California standards. In many cases, we follow the California standard, but those rules could face new challenges in states that may adopt the new Loper Bright standard of review for state agency actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a glimmer of good news regarding the deference our state courts give to DEP. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recognized the principle of agency deference well before <em>Chevron</em> was decided in 1984. Since then, the Court has <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2394456/seeton-v-pennsylvania-game-comn/"">repeatedly cited <em>Chevron</em></a> to explain its decisions. The fact that the U.S. Supreme Court has changed its mind doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean our Supreme Court will agree. But we must remain vigilant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Agencies will continue to enact regulations.&nbsp; And those regulations will continue to be subject to challenges both from those who believe them to be too burdensome and from those who believe them to be too weak.&nbsp; After <em>Loper Bright</em>, the question of whether those regulations will withstand challenge is now exclusively in the hands of whatever judge ends up hearing the challenge (which will certainly result in more &ldquo;forum shopping&rdquo; to get the &ldquo;right&rdquo; judge).&nbsp; We expect to see greater participation from experts and advocacy organizations in these challenges, as those on both sides attempt to persuade the judge of the correctness of their arguments.&nbsp; At PennFuture, our legal team will continue to push for strong federal and state regulations to protect our air and water and to continue to beat back against the ravages of climate change.&nbsp; We will help defend agency regulations that work towards these goals, and we will help challenge agency regulations that are not protective enough. We believe this power grab&mdash;taking away power from agencies and instead relocating it in the federal judiciary&mdash;is undemocratic and harmful.&nbsp; And you can count on us being there, even when things are stacked against us, to still fight for regulations that protect our health and our environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Pennsylvania needs PRESS now more than ever,7/3/2024,"<p>The fracked gas industry should be worried. Lawmakers are considering a bill to increase Pennsylvania&rsquo;s usage of clean energy sources. On June 24, 2024, the PA House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee held a hearing on HB 2277 (Otten) to consider the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard, better known as &ldquo;PRESS&rdquo;&mdash;an overhaul of the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) Act. PRESS envisions a future where 35% of our energy is derived from Tier I sources by 2035. This ambitious goal necessitates a significant expansion of our solar generation, a vision we glimpsed in the <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/SolarFuture/Pages/Finding-Pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-Solar-Future.aspx"">&ldquo;Finding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future&rdquo;</a> project in 2018, along with parallel growth in wind and other clean sources.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><img alt="""" class=""align-left"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/download.jpg"" style=""width: 276px; height: 183px; float: left;"" /><strong>How did we get here?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>In 2004, Pennsylvania passed the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) Act to diversify its energy sources. The goal was to promote a cleaner environment and protect PA households from increasing energy costs. It accomplished this by establishing what is known as &ldquo;portfolio standards&rdquo; or targets, requiring energy companies to ensure that a certain percentage of the energy they sell in Pennsylvania comes from clean sources such as solar and wind, among others. Pennsylvania was among the first states to adopt a portfolio standard. Still, the goals set for clean energy turned out to be too modest&mdash;clean &ldquo;Tier I&rdquo; energy sources were to provide a mere 8% of our energy needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consequently, other states surpassed us in attracting new clean energy development and the associated job opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Expanding solar generation is the right move for Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>If we hope to avoid the worst impacts of the growing climate crisis, we need to maximize our clean, renewable generation as quickly as possible. Cutting carbon pollution is vital, but more clean energy means fewer toxic air pollutants, heavy metals, harmful particulates, and smog-producing chemicals will be dumped in our atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Can I live near a solar farm and not develop asthma? <strong>Yes</strong>, there is no scientific evidence that living near a solar farm poses any health risks.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Can I raise children near a solar farm without them developing cancer? <strong>Yes</strong>, there is no scientific evidence that living near a solar farm poses any health risks.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The same cannot be said for living next to a fracking pad.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Solar energy also makes economic sense. Sharon Pillar, Executive Director of the PA Solar Center, testified about recent modeling showing a bill like this bringing over $13 billion in new investment over the next few years and creating over 100,000 jobs. Robert Routh, attorney and Policy Director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, spoke about the Council&rsquo;s analysis, showing PRESS could create over 15,000 new jobs each year from 2025 through 2040 while increasing the energy we export to other states.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><img alt="""" class=""align-left"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/6206184246%5Fce3ec3d39e%5Fw.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 225px; float: left;"" /><strong>We need PRESS now more than ever.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>When AEPS was first considered, coal generation was responsible for 57 percent of Pennsylvania&#39;s electricity, and methane gas (in the days before fracking) provided less than 1 percent. Today, fracked gas provides more than 58 percent of our electricity, and coal is at 6 percent and falling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the fracking industry is quick to point out that coal&rsquo;s failure to compete in the market with fracked gas resulted in lower emissions, they want us to ignore that the gas boom has left us in a dangerous and unsustainable situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the pandemic in 2022, fracked gas set bad records for its price volatility. Worse yet, retail prices in the region were almost 50 percent higher than at the start of the fracking boom. Not surprisingly, consumers&rsquo; electric prices also spiked with the increasing dependence on fracked gas for generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While boom-and-bust volatility is common in the fossil fuel industry, the poor gas reliability problem exacerbated the situation. During Winter Storm Elliot, which struck Pennsylvania over Christmas 2023, more than 70 percent of the unplanned outages on the PJM power grid were caused by gas plants being unable to run when needed. That drove wholesale electric prices in some places on our grid over $3,700 per megawatt hour, more than 200 times our typical wholesale prices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would be ridiculous to imagine a financial advisor who, upon finding their client had 58% of their life savings in a highly volatile and risky stock, would recommend that the best course of action would be to double down and put even more eggs in that basket.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to mitigate volatility and risk, the obvious answer is to diversify your investments. If someone were to suggest otherwise, you might suspect they are putting their own interests ahead of yours and (rightly) take everything they say with a large grain of salt.&nbsp; Hearing the fracking industry say Pennsylvania needs more gas is a giant red flag and should raise those same concerns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The fracking industry has reason to worry.&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Having seen the coal industry go from dominating the energy generation sector to a footnote in just a few years, the fracking industry is rightly scared of the same happening to them. The writing may be on the wall already&mdash;clean, renewable generation is often less expensive and is getting cheaper. When we look at &ldquo;active&rdquo; projects in our power grid&rsquo;s interconnection process, Pennsylvania has over 9,400 megawatts of solar and only 35 megawatts of gas in the pipeline. As much as the industry wants to blame environmentalists and regulators for its woes, it seems to have increasing difficulty convincing Wall Street that it is a good bet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there was any doubt that the industry is worried, the performance of one of the pro-fracking speakers from the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association (PMA) at the hearing was telling. I can&rsquo;t say he included every misleading half-truth, scare tactic, or borderline conspiracy theory that anyone ever applied to solar energy. Still, if he left any out, it wasn&rsquo;t for lack of trying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The telling exchange, though, came after his talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Representative Otten, the prime sponsor of the PRESS bill, spoke up: &ldquo;I am always entertained by your hyperbole&hellip;&rdquo; (she began before noting the speaker was, ostensibly, at the hearing representing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s manufacturing interests).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Rep. Otten: &ldquo;So is that the position of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association that you&#39;re not interested in and taking advantage of the federal programs [Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act] that are designed to grow the economy and bring jobs to Pennsylvania?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rather than answer &ldquo;no,&rdquo; the speaker took the opportunity to lecture the Representative on the virtues of private investment and expressed concern that competition in the market might cause the gas industry to &ldquo;lose organic economic growth.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rep. Causer added an accusation that investments such as these were a case of the government &ldquo;picking winners and losers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>While the speaker from PMA referred to federal clean energy investments as &ldquo;market manipulations,&rdquo; neither he nor Rep. Causer mentioned how heavily subsidized the fossil fuel industry has been at the state and federal levels for decades. Also, when Rep. Armanini&mdash;who earlier criticized clean energy&mdash;complained that a company in his district didn&rsquo;t qualify for a particular government program, he didn&rsquo;t get the same lecture on the virtue of private investment; there was no suggestion that the program was a &ldquo;market manipulation;&rdquo; there was just a mournful look from the speaker who said, &ldquo;that is very sad.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to ask: Why is it that the polluting industry never seems to be held to the same standards as clean energy?&nbsp;</p>

The Unspoken Truth: Economic Policy is Environmental Policy,6/28/2024,"<p><span style=""font-size:11px;"">(<strong>Title image:</strong> Shell Cracker Plant by Mark Dixon)</span></p>

<p>Economic development projects shape the landscape and impact everyday life by influencing air quality, traffic volume, stormwater flow, and local employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Economic development can bring massive benefits to our communities, but it also brings other consequences that must be considered. These social and environmental considerations are known as &quot;externalities.&quot; The most common and visible examples in Pennsylvania include abandoned mine drainage leaching pollution into local waterways, job loss due to the closure of coal-fired power plants, and toxic emissions that degrade air quality and hasten climate change. These externalities often have a disproportionate impact on historically underinvested, low-resource communities and communities of color, and their effects can last for generations.</p>

While industry refuses to calculate the health care costs of toxic emissions or place a monetary value on clean water and open space, we know that it is necessary. We live in a culture that looks to the market for solutions to all kinds of problems. If we do not calculate the value or cost of something, the market cannot offer a solution, and government policy cannot appropriately fund programs that address, mitigate, or disincentivize harm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s new report, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PF%5FDCED%5FReport%5F5.pdf"">Economic Policy <em>is</em>&nbsp;Environmental Policy</a>,&nbsp;engages with these issues, initiating a dialogue about the confluence of economic development and environmental impacts.

<p>The combination of fossil fuel-centered economic policies and weak environmental regulations has resulted in an economy that depends on dirty, finite energy resources, making it vulnerable to economic volatility. Most recently, Pennsylvania&#39;s economic development policies led to the construction of a new ethane cracker plant. However, the plant <a href=""https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pennsylvanias-Bad-Bet-FINAL.pdf"">fails to deliver</a> on the number of jobs promised and <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/environment-energy/2024-04-22/attorney-general-shell-whistleblower-pipeline-spills?utm_source=WESA&amp;utm_campaign=087ba0c34e-inboxedition_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5e22383ecb-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D"">consistently violates its permits</a>, releasing toxic pollutants into the air. If Pennsylvania continues to rely on the fossil fuel industries that dominated the last two centuries, our workers and our communities will be left behind.

<p>This is because market forces are shifting, causing fossil fuels like coal and fracked gas to be in decline;&nbsp; and yet new opportunities abound. Fellow industrial states, like Ohio, West Virginia, and even Texas and Wyoming, are pivoting their economies in a different direction - toward renewable energy and <a href=""https://www.wsaz.com/2023/06/20/battery-manufacturing-plant-coming-ohio/"">cleantech manufacturing</a>. They are proactively investing in high-growth industries to strengthen and stabilize their economies against the volatility and decline of fossil fuels. While these states are not driven by the goal of environmental protection, these economic policy choices will result in better environmental outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The writing is on the wall: Forward-thinking economic development policy can transform Pennsylvania back into a leader in both the manufacturing and energy sectors. Decision-makers need to capitalize on high-growth industries that both decarbonize and diversify the economy, like battery manufacturing, energy efficiency, and the deployment of renewables. In the face of national economic and technological changes, stabilizing and modernizing Pennsylvania&#39;s economy must be paramount &mdash;&nbsp;for the sake of our workers and the climate.&nbsp;<br />
The Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) plays a crucial role in shaping Pennsylvania&#39;s economy. Our report delves into the organization&#39;s structure, administration, and importance, highlighting its key role in driving economic development policy for the state. Despite being unfamiliar to many, the DCED is pivotal in setting and facilitating the agenda for the state&#39;s long-term economic development. As we move towards a decarbonized economy, it is essential for the DCED to proactively engage with the current landscape, ensuring that all communities, especially vulnerable ones, are included in this necessary economic transition.</p>

<p>As we point out in the report, there are concrete steps that can be taken to move the needle on this economic and environmental project. First, to take advantage of its strengths, the DCED must be reformed and its resources redirected toward industries that support the future of our workforce, communities, and public health, with an eye towards our environment and the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians. Establishing Climate Accountability Measures within its funding structure for program priorities and reshaping Pennsylvania&#39;s Energy Economy program would provide the necessary structure to prioritize clean energy investments and decarbonization efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Bradford.jpg"" style=""width: 300px; height: 300px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Susquehanna.jpg"" style=""width: 300px; height: 300px;"" /></p>

<p>Second, the DCED must leverage its private sector influence through its strategic collaborations with public and private partnerships to facilitate Pennsylvania&#39;s transition to a modern and equitable economy, via an aggressive sector-based climate strategy. Pushing to reform Team PA (a private, 501(c)(3) organization tasked with <a href=""https://teampa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Team-PA-Executive-Order-2023.pdf"">&quot;increasing job growth, retention, and creation&quot;</a>) as a champion for Pennsylvania&#39;s transition to a decarbonized and diversified economy is the first step, beginning with the intentional inclusion of environmental groups on its private sector board of directors. Subsequently, to bolster Team PA&#39;s new mission, the state must create an interagency Clean Energy Working Group, which would develop a comprehensive plan that supports environmental justice and energy communities through the strategic deployment of decarbonization, energy efficiency, and renewable energy resources and infrastructure in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These changes will set Pennsylvania on a path toward establishing a stable economy that can sustain workers, communities, and the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Declining fossil fuel markets and the impacts of the severe weather generated by our changing climate are driving decarbonization efforts across the country, and we are now seeing the creation of the necessary economic tools to fund them. Continued dependence on fossil fuels is an outdated economic game plan that will destabilize Pennsylvania&#39;s economy and perpetuate environmental and community degradation and injustice. A forward-thinking economic policy that prioritizes the decarbonization and renewable energy sectors can provide long-term certainty for industry and labor in a political climate that breeds instability through battles over environmental policy. We know how to get there and DCED is the key.</p>

Summer 2024 Legal Interns,6/6/2024,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.<br />
But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognize that we need to be more involved with cultivating the people that will continue to support our mission. Our staff have a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.&nbsp;<br />
With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting Pennsylvania as well as to further their potential environmental careers. We&rsquo;ve seen success on this front as many of our legal interns have found work in the Pennsylvania environmental legal space. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.&nbsp;<br />
Over the past four years, our interns have made it possible for PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team to do more, faster, and better! They have supported our litigation efforts against water polluters and fracked-gas facilities, they have drafted comments in support of stronger regulatory protections across the Commonwealth, and they have helped our attorneys strategize and execute impactful legal actions. We are grateful for all of the hard work, passion, and dedication of our legal interns.&nbsp;<br />
This summer, we have three fantastic students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We&rsquo;ve asked our new interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</p>

<p><strong>Andriana Vega, rising Third Year student at Penn State Dickinson Law</strong><br />
Growing up in the Midwest around factory farming piqued my interest in environmental law. While farming is crucial to sustaining our population, the effects factory farming has on communities and the environment are devastating. The work done at PennFuture is precisely the reason I chose to become an attorney: to help move towards more sustainable practices in all industries, not just farming.<br />
I am most excited about learning from the experienced individuals at PennFuture and being able to contribute to projects that actually make a difference in the fight to preserve the environment. Climate change may not happen overnight, but it&rsquo;s the little victories that will tilt the needle.<br />
While at Penn State Dickinson Law I have remained actively involved in the community, serving as President of the school&rsquo;s Animal Legal Defense Fund; Vice President of Environmental Law Society; Co-founder, Treasurer and Vice President of the school&rsquo;s multicultural dance organization, The Moving Party; Treasurer of Hearsay Acapella Group; Chair of the Wellness Committee; and member of Phi Alpha Delta and the Latin Law Students Association.</p>

<p><strong>Jessie Staley, rising Third Year student at St. John&rsquo;s University School of Law</strong><br />
Environmentalism has been a passion in my personal life for many years, but I had not considered it as a future career until I started law school. As a rising third year law student at St. John&#39;s Law in New York, I am looking forward to a career in international environmental law.<br />
I completed my BA in Political Science and International Studies, with a focus in Peace Studies, at the University of Missouri. There, I gained an interest in civil armed conflicts and found that many start and persist due to environmental stressors, such as oil and/or food insecurity. I came to law school with the hopes of learning more about International Humanitarian Law and the legal frameworks for the intergovernmental organizations who lead international peace work, like the United Nations. While taking my first year courses, like Property Law, I found more intersections between the environment and conflict. I discovered my niche career path in International Water Law, addressing water scarcity as a strategy for peace work.<br />
I am very excited to work with PennFuture this summer to learn more about the nonprofit space and localized legal advocacy. With their Clean Water initiative, I have many opportunities to learn more about water law and various strategies to advocate for water access and quality. I hope to continue learning about environmental law and to learn new ways to be a better environmental lawyer from PennFuture&rsquo;s holistic advocacy approach.</p>

<p><strong>Jasmine Gunning, rising Third Year student at Penn State Law</strong><br />
I am currently a J.D. candidate at Penn State Law (&#39;25) at University Park, PA. At Penn State Law, I have the pleasure of serving as Fellowship Chair for the Criminal Law Society, Outreach Coordinator for the Human Rights Society, and Secretary for the Immigration Law Society. Coming into law school, I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what kind of law I wanted to practice, but I knew I wanted two things: to feel as if I&rsquo;m making a difference, and to help others in some way. Environmental law checks both of those boxes for me.<br />
Growing up in rural South Carolina, I&rsquo;ve always had great respect for our environment and all of the things it provides us with &ndash; food, water, recreation, and the space to just be. Over the years I&rsquo;ve watched my home state develop and grow tremendously. This extreme growth has taught me a lot about the importance of both sustainability and conservation, as well as the interplay between the two, especially in marginalized communities. Wanting to ensure that those two concepts stay at the forefront of development and progress is what led me to environmental law, and more particularly, energy law.<br />
Over the past semester, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant in the shale division of the Penn State Law Center for Agriculture and Shale Law. That experience gave me the opportunity to study the specifics of the oil and gas industry, as well as how policymaking affects the industry, and vice versa. I am excited to apply this knowledge to my time here at PennFuture this summer, while also learning more about other areas of environmental law and policy. PennFuture&rsquo;s commitment to environmental advocacy is what drew me to this organization and I&rsquo;m so honored to be part of the team!</p>

Navigating Pennsylvania's Clean Water Priorities: Championing a Statewide Water Legislative Agenda,6/5/2024,"<p>This spring has led to yet <a href=""https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania-politics/pennsylvania-budget-talks-heat-up-as-republican-lawmakers-seek-tax-cut/"">another contentious budget season</a> in Harrisburg. While lawmakers negotiate funding and appropriation priorities before their June 30th deadline, the current two-year legislative session and, consequently, the window of opportunity to get bills passed through the chambers of the General Assembly and to the Governor&rsquo;s desk is also coming to a close.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Budget season presents a unique opportunity to see movement on critical environmental investment and policy priorities outside of the traditional legislative process. Despite plenty of debate over the ideal tools and policies, the budget process provides <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Applauds-Historic-Environmental-Investments-Included-in-New-State-Budget"">space for bipartisan cooperation</a> to achieve the goals of protecting and restoring Pennsylvania&rsquo;s abundant waterways.</p>

<p>On May 7, 2024, watershed coalition partners from across the Commonwealth met with 24 lawmakers in the Capitol for the 8th annual Clean Water Education Day. The <a href=""https://www.choosecleanwater.org/"">Choose Clean Water Coalition</a>, <a href=""https://www.delriverwatershed.org/"">Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed</a>, and members of the <a href=""https://www.healthylakes.org/"">Healing Our Water-Great Lakes Coalition</a> outlined their top five clean water priorities:</p>

<h2><strong>Funding &amp; Policy Priorities</strong></h2>

<p>The coalitions called on the General Assembly and Governor Shapiro to support two new funding and legislative priorities:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Create the Healthy Outdoors for All Program (HOAP)</strong>, which would provide matching grants to fund projects that rehabilitate and support trails, parks, and open spaces. Clean water quality isn&#39;t just crucial for safeguarding public health and preserving ecosystems; it also enriches the recreational pursuits of those who cherish parks, trails, and the great outdoors. Supporting the establishment of the Healthy Outdoors for All Program will help revitalize and enhance parks, trails, and outdoor spaces, particularly expanding access for disadvantaged communities.</li>
	<li><strong>Support the Riparian Buffer Protection Act (House Bill 1275)</strong> which mandates a 100-foot riparian buffer along each side of a surface body of water and a 300-foot buffer around special protection (High Quality or Exception Value) waters. Riparian buffers play a crucial role in curbing pollution runoff, combating climate change impacts, safeguarding ecosystems, and serving as a cost-efficient method for managing water quality. The Riparian Buffer Protection Act stands as a vital initiative through which the Commonwealth can actively encourage the establishment of more of these invaluable natural assets.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our watershed partners remained committed to pushing for progress on three priorities carrying over from last year&rsquo;s effort. We called on decision-makers to:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Support full &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; funding for the Interstate Basin Commissions</strong> responsible for protecting and monitoring water quality and quantity.&nbsp;Inadequately funded and staffed commissions put Pennsylvania&rsquo;s communities at risk of suffering from increased water pollution, infrastructure issues, and declining aquatic wildlife. Funding requirements for the interstate basin commissions have been established for decades, and Pennsylvania must honor the commitment made to these compacts.</li>
	<li>Protect marginalized communities who bear the brunt of downstream pollution by <strong>codifying the Office of Environmental Justice (Senate Bill 158/House Bill 742) and the Environmental Justice Advisory Board (House Bill 707)</strong>. Clean water issues are also often environmental justice issues. We strongly advocate for strengthening the roles of the Office of Environmental Justice and the Environmental Justice Advisory Board to address the disproportionate burden borne by marginalized communities.</li>
	<li><strong>Support sustainable annual funding for the Clean Streams Fund</strong>, the first Pennsylvania fund dedicated to water protection and restoration, created with American Rescue Plan Act funding in the 2022-23 budget. The CSF addresses the three primary causes of water pollution in PA: acid mine drainage, agriculture, and stormwater runoff. The scale of water pollution in Pennsylvania means that a one-time injection of funds into the Clean Streams Fund will not be sufficient.&nbsp;</li>

<h2><strong>Tools for Engagement with Legislators &amp; Fellow Advocates</strong><br />
&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Meeting with lawmakers is a critical component of Clean Water Education Day, but the coalitions also recognize not all members and supporters can participate in-person in Harrisburg. As a result, we offer a variety of tools to contribute to this advocacy, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Call to Action for All Clean Water Advocates (New this year!)</strong> - This year, PennFuture created another opportunity for coalition partners and PennFuture&rsquo;s clean water supporters to let their legislators know how much they value clean water funding in the Pennsylvania budget. <a href=""https://secure.everyaction.com/SD7s8e17ok2SGbJls3nfbA2"">Click here to send a letter directly to your legislators!</a></li>
	<li><strong>Legislative Meetings</strong> - We held <strong>23 meetings </strong>with legislators representing portions of all of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s major watersheds, a majority of which were in person in Harrisburg. We met with and leaders of the Appropriations and Environmental Resources and Energy Committees. Each legislator received educational materials with summary talking points for our requests.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Coalition Partnerships</strong></h2>

<p>Clean Water Education Day involves great collaboration between PennFuture, <strong>the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed</strong>, and <strong>the Choose Clean Water Coalition</strong>. PennFuture has long held the role of Pennsylvania State Lead for both of these coalitions, which has allowed for the establishment of deep relationships with both the Coalition staff and their member organizations, both of which are vital to the success of this event. During the annual Clean Water Education event, Coalition staff leverage their resources to support the State Leads,&nbsp; producing talking points for joint priorities, communications materials, training, and social media content.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
PennFuture is now also serving as the state lead for the <strong>Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition</strong> and participating in <a href=""https://www.nwf.org/ohioriver"">collaborative advocacy in the Ohio River Valley Watershed</a> led by the National Wildlife Federation, the Ohio River Basin Alliance, and the Ohio River Valley Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO). We continue working to close the gap between Western PA and Harrisburg and are seeking out ways to engage with our Western PA partners.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Clean Water Education Day builds on the federal clean water advocacy of PennFuture staff as coalition state leads</strong>. Elected officials at all levels have roles in enhancing climate resilience, environmental justice, pollution prevention, and watershed-scale governance. PennFuture is ideally positioned to connect the dots between levels of government.</p>

<p>As state leads, PennFuture staff annually coordinate meetings for federal lobby days on behalf of the coalitions. The top priority for watershed Hill Days remains additional restoration funding - the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program, the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program, and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in the case of each coalition. Other legislative asks revolved around habitat and biodiversity loss prevention, climate investments in the newest version of the Farm Bill, climate-resilient water infrastructure, and more.</p>

<p>Coalition collaboration remains a central feature of PennFuture&rsquo;s clean water advocacy. Responsible stewardship of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s abundant waterways requires consistent policy pressure and watchdogging. Clean Water Education Day remains the critical vehicle to coalition collaborations in the Commonwealth, and we need everyone&rsquo;s help to keep the momentum going this budget season!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Members of the General Assembly, especially those on the Appropriations Committees, need to keep hearing about our priorities. <a href=""https://secure.everyaction.com/SD7s8e17ok2SGbJls3nfbA2"">Help keep the Clean Water Education Day momentum going by reaching out to your legislators!</a><br />

New Air Quality Report Shows More Work To Be Done For Pennsylvania’s Air,5/2/2024,"<p>A new report shows Pennsylvania communities continue to struggle with poor air quality.&nbsp;Numerous Pennsylvania counties received failing grades for ozone and particle pollution, and the Pittsburgh metropolitan area remains the worst city for short-term and annual particle pollution in the region despite incremental improvements.</p>

<p>On April 24, 2024, the American Lung Association (ALA) released its 25th annual <a href=""https://www.lung.org/research/sota"">State of the Air&nbsp;report</a>.&nbsp;In this report, the ALA used air quality data obtained from the U.S Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Air Quality System for two of the most widespread types of air pollution, ozone and particle pollution (also known as smog and soot).&nbsp;ALA analyzes this data to grade counties and rank cities based on ozone, year-round particle pollution, and short-term particle pollution levels.&nbsp;The 2024 report used data over the three-year period from 2020 to 2022.&nbsp;ALA&rsquo;s annual report allows the public to easily track air quality changes over time and to compare community exposures to air pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Many Pennsylvania Counties Receive Failing or Poor Grades for High Ozone Days or Particle Pollution</strong></h3>

<p>The report shows that many <a href=""https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/states/pennsylvania"">Pennsylvania residents are exposed to harmful levels of air pollution</a>.&nbsp;Based on the air quality data available, the report assigned grades for 36 out of the 67 counties in Pennsylvania for at least one measure of air quality.&nbsp;Bucks and Philadelphia counties both received a failing grade for the number of high ozone days, with Allegheny County receiving a D grade and six other Pennsylvania counties receiving a C grade for high ozone days (Armstrong, Berks, Indiana, Mercer, Montgomery, and Northampton).</p>

<p>For short-term particle pollution, Allegheny and Lancaster counties each received a failing grade.&nbsp;Dauphin County received a D grade for short-term particle pollution and nine other Pennsylvania counties received a C grade (Beaver, Berks, Chester, Cumberland, Delaware, Lebanon, Northampton, Philadelphia, and York).</p>

<p>The grades and rankings for annual particle pollution in the 2024 report were calculated using the new, long-awaited National Ambient Air Quality Standards for fine particle pollution implemented by the EPA earlier this year.&nbsp;The EPA establishes these standards to be protective of public health, including sensitive populations, with an adequate margin of safety using the latest science and health data.&nbsp;The updated annual standard for fine particle pollution is now 9 micrograms per cubic meter, down from the previous standard of 12.</p>

<p>As a result of the report&rsquo;s use of the updated standard for annual particle pollution, more places around the country earned a failing grade in this year&rsquo;s report compared to the previous year, including counties in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;Seven Pennsylvania counties, Allegheny, Cambria, Dauphin, Delaware, Lancaster, Philadelphia, and York, all received failed grades for annual particle pollution.&nbsp;Overall, 18 counties in Pennsylvania received a C grade or lower for at least one pollutant measure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Pittsburgh Metro Area Remains Worst in Region for Particle Pollution</strong></h3>

<p>This year&rsquo;s report once again showed that the cities with the highest levels of short-term particle pollution were those cities in the western U.S.&nbsp;The report identifies wildfires in the western U.S. and Canada as the major contributing factor to the increasing number of days and places with unhealthy levels of particle pollution in recent years.&nbsp;As a result, the 25 cities most polluted by daily particle pollution are all located west of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>For the first time, the 12-county Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metropolitan area was edged out of the report&rsquo;s list of the 25 worst cities for daily particle pollution, coming in 26th in this year&rsquo;s report.&nbsp;The Pittsburgh metropolitan area remained in the top 25 list for worst polluted cities for annual particle pollution, ranking 19th in this year&rsquo;s report.&nbsp;However, despite incremental improvement in particle pollution levels, the Pittsburgh metropolitan area retains the dubious distinction of being the worst in the Mid-Atlantic region for annual particle pollution and the worst in the country east of Fargo, North Dakota for daily particle pollution levels.</p>

<p>Allegheny County received failing grades for both daily and annual particle pollution under the new EPA standard, despite incremental improvements in particle pollution levels.&nbsp; Allegheny County saw a slight increase in the annual weighted average of unhealthy air days for ozone smog, earning it a D grade, down from the C grade it received in last year&rsquo;s report.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh area&rsquo;s continued status as the worst in the region for particle pollution and its high ranking nationwide, even without the acute impacts of wildfires experienced by the higher-ranked cities in the West, demonstrates the impact of local pollution sources on our region&rsquo;s air quality and the need for holding local industrial polluters accountable for particle pollution.</p>

<p>Overall, the 2024 &ldquo;State of the Air&rdquo; reports shows that many Pennsylvania residents are still experiencing the harmful effects of air pollution in their daily lives, and that much more needs to be done to ensure communities across the state can breathe clean air.</p>

"Public Participation, Public Power: PennFuture’s Community Land Use Process Guidebook",4/22/2024,"<h3><strong>Is This You?</strong></h3>

<p>Picture this: You have just learned of a significant land development proposal in your municipality. Maybe it&rsquo;s a massive distribution center, a sprawling resort, or a new shopping center. Or, maybe you heard rumors that your neighbor plans to convert their property into an Airbnb or a wedding venue. Maybe you learned of these things only after construction started and wish you&rsquo;d known sooner. Or, maybe you want to be proactive and ensure that future land use and development in your area is rational and serves the needs of the community.

With a variety of government bodies making numerous types of land use decisions in multiple types of proceedings (not to mention arcane public notice requirements!), it&rsquo;s no wonder that the public often feels left in the dark and without a voice. PennFuture aims to change that, because we believe that robust, informed public participation in local land use decision-making is vital to protecting our environment and our communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Land Use is an Environmental Issue</strong></h3>

<p>Most of us intuitively understand how land use and development impact the character of our communities and our quality of life. What may seem less obvious is just how much appropriate management of land use and development is vital to protecting the natural environment. Where and to what extent land development occurs dictates the amount of impervious surface on the land, which in turn impacts water quality in nearby ground and surface waters and the amount of habitat available to wild plant and animal species. Sprawling land development patterns force longer, more frequent vehicle trips, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants, as well as the amount of impervious road surface required to connect destinations. Even agricultural uses (not commonly thought of as &ldquo;development&rdquo;) can result in loss of native habitats, increase wind erosion, limit the amount of water available for other uses, and degrade water quality by introducing pesticides, fertilizers, and nutrients from animal manure into water sources.</p>

<p>Intelligent and informed regulation of land use and development is key to controlling environmental impacts, and intelligent and informed public participation in local land use decision-making is key to appropriate regulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, the power to govern land use and development resides almost entirely at the local level. Local governments have substantial power to control where land development can occur, the amount of impervious surface that may be constructed on any given parcel, the physical dimensions of structures, their relationship to neighboring properties and environmental features, and the level of public review required for each use. And local residents have substantial power to influence these decisions, if they know how. That&rsquo;s where PennFuture can help.</p>

Moore Township Decision Demonstrates Importance Of Robust Warehouse Ordinances,4/8/2024,"<p>A recent decision by the Northampton County Court of Common Pleas demonstrates how robust zoning ordinances can protect the environment and surrounding communities from the impacts of logistics development.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2022%2D09%2D29%5F15%5F43%5F36%5FView%5Fnorth%5Falong%5FPennsylvania%5FState%5FRoute%5F512%5F%28Moorestown%5FDrive%29%5Fjust%5Fnorth%5Fof%5FYost%5FRoad%5Fin%5FMoore%5FTownship%2D%5FNorthampton%5FCounty%2D%5FPennsylvania.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 300px;"" /></h3>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p><br />
Developer Water&rsquo;s Edge at Windgap, LLC (&ldquo;Water&rsquo;s Edge&rdquo;), sought to redevelop an existing golf course to build two warehouse buildings with a combined floor area of 488,150 square feet. However, the Township&rsquo;s zoning ordinance constrained the site&rsquo;s developable area by limiting disturbance of steep slopes and woodlands and requiring an earthen berm between the building and the roadway. Seeking to maximize the size of the buildings, the developer challenged these restrictions before the Moore Township zoning hearing board (&ldquo;ZHB&rdquo;).</p>

<p><br />
Ordinance Restrictions Protect the Environment and Community Water&rsquo;s Edge first argued that it should not be required to preserve steep slopes on the property because the existing slopes were &ldquo;manmade&rdquo; slopes constructed as part of the golf course design, not &ldquo;natural&rdquo; slopes. The Court agreed with the ZHB that this distinction did not matter, as the Moore Township zoning ordinance did not distinguish between &ldquo;manmade&rdquo; and &ldquo;natural&rdquo; slopes. In fact, the Court held, such a distinction would lead to &ldquo;thorny-bordering-on-philosophical&rdquo; problems, as developers and the Township would be forced to decide the amount of human intervention that would transform a steep slope or other feature from a natural feature into a manmade one.</p>

<p><br />
The&nbsp; ordinance also required the preservation of at least 60% of the woodland on the site and required a 100-foot wide earthen berm between the building and the road frontage. Water&rsquo;s Edge claimed that it was impossible to comply with both of these provisions because the majority of the woodland on site was located along the road frontage where the berm was to be located. Alternatively, the developer sought a variance from the woodland disturbance requirement, claiming that having to both preserve the woodland and construct a berm was an undue hardship.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
The Court disagreed. It upheld the ZHB&rsquo;s ruling that the developer was required to comply with both the earthen berm requirement and the limitation on woodland disturbance. There was nothing in the ordinance, the Court held, that required the developer to construct the earthen berm immediately adjacent to the roadway, where the woodland was located. The berm could be located anywhere between the building and the road frontage, including between the building and the woodland. Yes, this would likely require the developer to reduce the size of the buildings, but the Court held that this was no hardship, as the developer &ldquo;provided no reason, aside from an understandable desire to maximize its profits, why it could not construct a smaller warehouse, build one warehouse rather than two, or otherwise modify its plans to strictly comply with the Zoning Ordinance&rsquo;s required woodland protection rate.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where no hardship is shown,&rdquo; the Court concluded, &ldquo;or where the asserted hardship amounts to a landowner&rsquo;s desire to increase profitability or maximize development potential, the unnecessary hardship criterion required to obtain a variance is not satisfied.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><br />
Power to Restrain Development is Limited Where No Ordinance Requirements Exist</h3>

<p><br />
This same decision also demonstrates how municipalities&rsquo; ability to constrain development is limited when that power is not expressly set forth in an ordinance. As with most logistics development, the Water&rsquo;s Edge project was to occur &ldquo;on spec,&rdquo; meaning that the developer planned to design and construct the facility before identifying a tenant or end user for the space. The ZHB sought to require the developer to identify a specific tenant, asserting that the information was vital to evaluate the effect the development would have on the community, particularly its traffic traffic impacts. The ZHB reasoned that this information was essential because the buildings would be the two largest buildings in the Township, would likely generate the most traffic, and were located several miles from the nearest highway.</p>

<p><br />
The Court held that the ZHB could not demand this information from the developer because warehouses were a permitted use on the site, and no provision of the zoning ordinance gave the Township the right to deny the project based on traffic concerns or any other consideration beyond the specific requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. When a use is a permitted use, it is allowed by right as long as the developer complies with the specific requirements of the zoning ordinance, even if the resulting development has a substantial adverse impact on the surrounding community. Therefore, the Court held that &ldquo;so long as the Zoning Ordinance&rsquo;s dimensional restrictions and other applicable regulations are met, we find no authority to support the notion that the Board may deny permission to an applicant based on a finding that this particular planned warehousing use is exceptionally impactful and worrisome compared to other warehouses.&rdquo;</p>

<p><br />
The outcome would be different, the Court opined, if warehouses had been a conditional use or special exception use instead of a permitted use. Approval for these types of uses may be denied if it is demonstrated that the specific development proposed would result in a substantially greater detriment to public health, safety, and welfare than a typical development of that type. Therefore, if warehouses were a conditional use or a special exception use on the property, the ZHB would be justified in seeking more information about the end user of the space and their proposed operations to ascertain the extent of the impact on the public. As it was, however, the ordinance did not give the ZHB that power, and the ZHB would have no lawful use for the requested information. Realizing this issue, Moore Township has since amended its ordinance to designate warehouses as conditional uses wherever they are permitted.</p>

<h3><br />
PennFuture&rsquo;s Model Logistics Use Ordinance&nbsp;</h3>

<p><br />
The above case illustrates why PennFuture developed <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Publication-Living-With-Logistics-A-Model-Logistics-Use-Zoning-Ordinance-for-Pennsylvania-Municipalities"">Living With Logistics: A Model Logistics Use Zoning Ordinance for Pennsylvania Municipalities</a>. Many Pennsylvania municipalities lack the carefully-crafted, robust zoning ordinance provisions necessary to appropriately control the proliferation of logistics uses such as warehouses, distribution centers, and fulfillment centers. Others, like Moore Township when the Water&rsquo;s Edge project was proposed, have ordinances that are strong in some respects but could be strengthened in others. Living with Logistics aims to give municipalities the resources they need to understand the proliferation of logistics development and to craft ordinances that will maximize their power to guide and control it for the benefit of the environment and neighboring residents.&nbsp;<br />

3 Ways to Advocate for Pennsylvania’s Environment,4/2/2024,"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyone can be an environmental advocate. We, at PennFuture, appreciate you for taking the first step &mdash; having an interest in environmental issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is Environmental Advocacy?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Environmental advocacy involves using your voice to influence public policy at the local, state, and national levels to achieve positive outcomes for the environment and climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While your individual actions in your community matter, the real progress on environmental protection, conservation, and climate change comes from policy shifts: getting stronger regulations and laws that protect water and habitats, limit industrial air pollution, and punish companies who dump toxins into waterways.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Ways you can be an Environmental Advocate with PennFuture:</h2>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3><strong>The ACE Program</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s Advocates for Conservation and the Environment volunteers provide local and state lawmakers with the opportunity to learn about environmental issues directly from their own constituents.</p>

<p>Interested individuals receive guidance from PennFuture staff on how to take the first steps to meet with their local elected officials. These meetings are aimed at building and reinforcing relationships with representatives at the federal and state levels, and are conducted as a grassroots, non-partisan effort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ACE volunteers meet with elected officials from both sides of the aisle, regardless of political affiliations, to advocate policy objectives rather than to advance an ideological agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PennFuture Civic Engagement Team provides support to the ACE volunteers every step of the way, thus taking on the burden of meeting planning, drafting key talking points, and collecting information on environmental issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;ACE volunteers have played a crucial role in bringing issues such as watershed protection, community solar, and other environmental issues to the forefront of their legislators&#39; minds,&rdquo; said <strong>Jess Cadorette, Director of Civic Engagement,</strong> &ldquo;It is essential for everyday people to voice their concerns about the environment with the elected officials who represent them in order to make progress on these issues.&quot;</p>

<p>From 2022 to 2023, PennFuture ACE advocates hosted 24 meetings with lawmakers that featured discussions on Solar For Schools legislation, how to improve equity in the delivery of conservation program funds and technical assistance, and understanding the economic and job growth impact of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, among other topics.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Writing for Change: Op-Ed &amp; Letters-to-the-Editor Submissions</strong></h3>

<p>Writing can change minds. A <a href=""https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/QJPS-16112"">2018 study</a> found that Op-Eds had a long lasting impact on readers and have persuaded people&rsquo;s opinions on policy issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The editorial pages of print or digital news outlets are among the most read sections. This presents a great opportunity to reach out to your neighbors and lawmakers by expressing your thoughts in writing. Writing an Op-Ed or a shorter length Letter-to-the-Editor allows you to share your unique firsthand experience and add passion and emotion to any cause or issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just as with our ACE Program, our PennFuture staff will support you along the way, providing examples, offering to review, and showing how to submit your letter to newspapers in your region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Our volunteers have written about the need to support farmers with conservation funding in the Farm Bill, as well as their fears about the impact of massive warehouse developments encroaching on their communities,&rdquo; <strong>Maria Ocasio, Lehigh Valley Field Coordinator</strong>. &ldquo;Writing is a powerful tool to connect more with your community and really get the word out on issues that matter to you. We&#39;ve seen our volunteers&#39; writing later referenced in city council meetings and discussed during legislative town hall meetings. Decision makers do pay attention to their constituents.&quot;</p>

<p>Since 2022, PennFuture volunteers have had 51 letters published in Pennsylvania newspapers on environmental issues.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Empowering Communities: Local Land Use Guide Books</strong></h3>

<p>A growing concern for many Pennsylvanians is the proliferation of large distribution centers and truck terminals popping up in their towns. Spreading across the Lehigh Valley, Poconos, and beyond from the increased demand in online shopping, these large facilities create traffic congestion, noise, air pollution, and threaten environmentally sensitive areas and waterways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first step for advocates is to understand the issues and potential solutions. In support of this, the PennFuture Legal Team developed both a <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Publication-Living-With-Logistics-A-Model-Logistics-Use-Zoning-Ordinance-for-Pennsylvania-Municipalities"">Model Municipal Ordinance</a> for zoning of logistics facilities, a toolkit to help advocate for the model ordinance, and a forthcoming how-to guide to the local land use processes, so that community members could have the knowledge and skills to get proposed issues in front of municipal leaders and encourage them to take action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Local land use issues are environmental issues. We have seen the impact that local residents can have in protecting our environment and safeguarding the health of our communities from emerging threats, and we want to empower the people to effectively advocate for these protections,&rdquo; said <strong>Abigail M. Jones, Vice President of Legal &amp; Policy</strong>. &ldquo;By creating these resources, we hope to equip community members with the necessary knowledge, skills, and solutions, and place the power in the hands of those most impacted by environmental and health threats.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3><strong>People Power</strong></h3>

<p>There is power in numbers. When constituents speak out on an issue, they can overcome the financial and political power of corporations and developers.&nbsp;Environmental advocacy enables us to express ourselves and to share our personal experiences regarding environmental issues that affect our communities to illuminate the change that needs to happen .&nbsp;</p>

<p>As more people become advocates for the environment, the full extent of the impact of these issues becomes clearer to policymakers and harder to ignore. The result can be action to pass laws that will help to improve the quality of our air, water, and climate - for all Pennsylvanians.</p>

Let the Failed DNA Hydrogen Hub Go and Turn the Page to a Cleaner Future,3/26/2024,"<p>In September 2022, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced that it was soliciting applicants for its <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/oced/regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-0"">Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub Program (H2Hubs)</a>, which would direct billions of dollars to large-scale <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Basics-of-Hydrogen"">hydrogen</a> projects across the nation through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>A total of three applications included Pennsylvania:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ARCH2</li>
	<li>MACH2</li>
	<li>DNA H2Hub</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project claimed to leverage Pennsylvania&#39;s existing infrastructure, technology expertise, and skilled labor force. The promoters of the DNA project &ndash; which was not chosen by DOE to receive federal dollars&nbsp; &ndash; are attempting to press on anyway, despite the deep risk of environmental and human harm to Southwestern PA. Why? A peek behind the curtain provides some answers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.arch2hub.com/"">Appalachia Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub (ARCH2)</a> is a WV-OH-PA-based &ldquo;<a href=""https://rmi.org/clean-energy-101-hydrogen/"">blue</a>&rdquo; hydrogen project and will utilize fracked-gas methane along with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to produce hydrogen and mitigate carbon emissions. The <a href=""https://mach-2.com/"">Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2)</a> is a PA-NJ-DE-based &ldquo;green&rdquo; hydrogen project and will utilize renewable energy to produce hydrogen. Both the ARCH2 and MACH2 projects advanced to the next round. However, the <a href=""https://www.decarbonizationnetworkofappalachia.org/"">Decarbonization Network of Appalachia (DNA)</a> project, another blue hydrogen hub based in OH-PA-WV, did not move forward. Getting denied billions of dollars in federal funding would be a good reason to scrap the project and move on, especially when another very similar project located in the same geography is moving forward. But <a href=""https://teampa.com/"">Team PA</a>, DNA&#39;s prime applicant, refuses to see the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>During the application period, Team PA - a peculiar public-private collaborative partnership between interest groups and the Commonwealth and co-chaired by the Governor - aimed to create a project supported by industry and labor that leveraged the Marcellus Shale gas reserves and proximity to Shell&#39;s ethane cracker plant in Beaver county. The plan was for Team PA to also manage the project&#39;s future implementation. Industry leaders involved in the project at varying times included Mitsubishi, <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/rally-against-shell-cracker-plant-monaca-one-year/"">Shell</a>, and Equinor (a Norwegian oil and gas company).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The DNA H2Hub promised to <a href=""https://teampa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DNAH2HubPublicSummary.pdf"">&quot;unlock affordable, clean hydrogen and decarbonize the supply chains, manufacturing, and power production in America&rsquo;s industrial heartland.&quot;</a>&nbsp; One of the clear goals of this project was to provide methane for polymer manufacturing for plastics production and energy production. This goal would be accomplished by doubling down on the fracked-gas methane production capacity in southwestern Pennsylvania. In essence, the project would seed and ultimately establish an artificial economic life-support system for the failing fracked gas industry, which is struggling to compete with low-cost renewable energy and is suffering from unfavorable market forces.</p>

<p>Southwestern Pennsylvania is home to some of the <a href=""https://www.lung.org/media/press-releases/pittsburgh-sota-2023#:~:text=The%202023%20%E2%80%9CState%20of%20the,year's%20report%20to%20a%20'C'"">most polluted communities</a> in the nation due to the legacy of steel, plastics, and refining operations based in the region. In fact, it is precisely this industrial history that makes it such an attractive place to try to seed hydrogen, a fuel that can be clean but can also just be a clean facade, or greenwashing. Communities here suffer the consequences of decades of hosting extractive, energy-intensive, and high-pollution industries. While there&rsquo;s no shame in the work folks here have done in the past, it&rsquo;s a simple fact that this legacy has left these communities economically dependent on these industries and struggling to emerge from under their smog-filled shadows. Locating the DNA H2Hub project in the heart of the Marcellus Shale region allows these high-polluting industries to continue this cycle of dependence,and the communities of Southwestern Pennsylvania will continue to be the ones holding the bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fenceline communities in southwestern Pennsylvania don&#39;t want more methane fracked from the ground, transported through leaky pipelines, and converted into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. They want a sustainable and healthy economy based on renewable energy, energy storage, sustainable manufacturing, and family-sustaining union jobs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Blue Hydrogen Fails Economics 101</h2>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Blue%2DHydrogen.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Even the fossil fuel giants recognize that it is time to flip the switch. Both Shell and Equinor pulled out of the DNA project before the Biden administration even announced the winners of the DOE&#39;s program. Now, <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2022/07/30/blue-hydrogen-climate-oil-and-gas/#:~:text=Blue%20hydrogen%20produces%20no%20carbon,the%20most%20potent%20greenhouse%20gas."">Shell is working on green hydrogen projects in Europe, Australia, and India</a>. Meanwhile, Equinor, which is Germany&#39;s primary source for gas, is collaborating with several other energy companies to field test hydrogen technology - <a href=""https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/hydrogen/abb-joins-hypilot-project-alongside-yara-equinor-20231030"">&quot;ultra-efficient electrolyzers&quot; with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost and &quot;facilitating the widespread adoption of large-scale green hydrogen production&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Why would these energy titans move their focus overseas to develop green hydrogen when the Marcellus Shale region is drowning in methane? Because they are profit-motivated, and the economics for blue hydrogen <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Turning-PA-into-a-Hydrogen-Hub-is-not-a-Sustainable-Energy-Solution"">do not make sense</a>. Equinor, in particular, can attest to the risk involved in developing blue hydrogen at-scale. The international company has <a href=""https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/02/15/experts-sound-alarm-oil-sectors-blue-hydrogen-push/"">a history of failed attempts at CCS projects</a>. The company had to abort a CCS project because <a href=""https://www.tu.no/artikler/to-av-tre-prestisjeprosjekter-for-co2-lagring-er-mislykket/234802"">the reservoir was at risk of collapsing</a>, and a <a href=""https://www.tu.no/artikler/ma-bruke-to-milliarder-kroner-for-a-redde-snohvit-gassen/235227"">second was halted because the injected CO2 was polluting the methane extracted from the site</a>. What&#39;s more, when Equinor was known as Statoil in 2013, it shutdown <a href=""https://www.equinor.com/en/news/archive/2013/09/20/20SepMongstad.html"">its Mongstad CCS plant</a> after just about a year of operation. Through decades of trial and error, Equinor has experienced the economic and technical challenges of blue hydrogen, and rather than continuing to invest in technology that consistently fails in both arenas, it is moving in a new direction.</p>

<p>Team PA offered a <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/PublicParticipation/Citizens%20Advisory%20Council/CACPortalFiles/Meetings/2024_01/Team%20PA%27s%20Hydrogen%20Presentation%20to%20DEP%20CAC%20-%20Thomas%20Murphy.pdf"">presentation</a> about the MACH2, ARCH2, and DNA hub projects to the Department of Environmental Protection&#39;s (DEP) <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/PublicParticipation/Citizens%20Advisory%20Council/CACPortalFiles/Meetings/2024_01/January%202024%20CAC%20Agenda%20-%20Version%202.pdf"">Citizens Advisory Council (CAC)</a>. During that presentation, Thomas Murphy, the Senior Managing Director of Strategic Energy Initiatives, said that in spite of two of its major partners pulling out and a lack of federal funding, the organization was moving forward with the project and would continue to collaborate with Mitsubishi. In the face of contrary market forces, lack of government investment, unproven technology, and abandonment by industry leaders, maddeningly, Team PA insists on doubling down on methane-derived hydrogen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bottom line is that blue hydrogen isn&rsquo;t climate friendly. Even when operating at its most efficient, experts argue that the blue hydrogen technology available right now is only 78% effective at capturing its carbon emissions. It takes additional energy input for carbon capture technology to run, which means that <a href=""https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/02/15/experts-sound-alarm-oil-sectors-blue-hydrogen-push/"">&quot;due to the increased amount of fossil gas needed to power the CCS process, blue hydrogen likely had a 20% higher carbon footprint than burning methane alone.&quot;</a> This should be said again: blue hydrogen, which supposedly takes a high impact fuel and makes it lower-impact, actually has a higher footprint than if it was never created in the first place. This is why groups like PennFuture are calling for <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Chasing-the-Rainbow-Carbon-Capture-is-Magic-Thinking"">investment in renewables first</a>, before throwing good money at bad technologies that perpetuate fracking and all of the negative health outcomes and economic failures that come with it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The DNA Hub Will Only Perpetuate the Harms of the Past</h2>

<p>Team PA claimed that the DNA hub would improve the economic conditions for workers by providing good-paying jobs for a &quot;marginalized, underserved, and fossil fuel-dependent region.&quot; In reality, it would maintain the status quo by offering the same hollow promises that the fossil fuel industry has offered for centuries, refusing to acknowledge the real threats that this project poses to the environment and, consequently, to workers and local communities. Simply put, the DNA H2Hub, if completed, will perpetuate the boom-bust economic cycle created by the extraction of both fossil fuel and labor resources with detrimental environmental and health consequences.</p>

<p>It would behoove Team PA, the Commonwealth, fenceline communities, and workers to follow Equinor&#39;s lead. Pennsylvanians - especially the most vulnerable, disaffected, and disenfranchised among us - do not need more empty promises and cycles of a boom-bust economy. We need a stable economy, a stable climate, and a healthy environment. Ironically, fossil fuels seem to be going the way of the dinosaur. And yet Team PA seems unwilling to recognize this fact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania needs Team PA to read the writing on the wall and pivot. They need to focus on serving the residents and workers of the Commonwealth, instead of chasing a scheme designed to keep the fracked gas industry afloat and distracting from real solutions like renewables, battery storage, and building a sustainable economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Going forward PennFuture will be focusing our efforts on pushing Pennsylvania towards a better economic future.

The People Have A Right: A Brief Overview Of Environmental Rights Amendment Case Law,3/25/2024,"<p>Pennsylvania&#39;s Constitution provides a unique Environmental Rights Amendment that guarantees our right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment and requires the Commonwealth to conserve and maintain Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources for the benefit of all people. Since the ERA&rsquo;s adoption in 1971, Pennsylvania courts have had the task of determining what it means. PennFuture constructs a brief history of the Environmental Rights Amendment court cases and the decisions that interpret and apply this important law.</p>

<h2><br />
In the Beginning&nbsp;</h2>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><br />
<strong>Commonwealth v. National Gettysburg Battlefield Tower, 311 A.2d 588 (Pa. 1973)&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><br />
In one of the earliest cases brought under the ERA, the Attorney General sought to prevent a private company from constructing a 307-foot observation tower 700 feet from Gettysburg National Military Park. The Attorney General argued that the tower violated the ERA because it would despoil the natural and historic values of the battlefield. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the ERA did not, by itself, allow the government to stop the actions of private parties in the absence of some other law prohibiting the activity. Since the ERA does not define things like &ldquo;clean air,&rdquo; &ldquo;pure water&rdquo; and &ldquo;historic value,&rdquo; allowing the government to bring suit against private parties for interfering with those values would mean that &ldquo;individuals could be singled out for interference by the awesome power of the state with no advance warning that their conduct would lead to such consequences.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Payne Era&nbsp;</h2>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Payne v. Kassab, 312 A.2d 86 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1973), affirmed by Payne v. Kassab, 361 A.2d 263 (Pa. 1976)&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next major ERA decision came in 1976. Residents of Wilkes-Barre claimed that the ERA prevented PennDOT from paving over a portion of a public park to widen a highway because doing so would harm the historic value of the park. The Commonwealth Court rejected &ldquo;such an absolute interpretation&rdquo; of the ERA and instead held that the ERA was intended to allow &ldquo;controlled development of resources rather than no development.&rdquo; The Court concluded that the ERA requires a balancing of environmental concerns and other legitimate government interests. It also devised a three-part test to assess whether the proper balancing had taken place. This test, which came to be known as the <em><strong>Payne test</strong></em>, asks:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Was there compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations relevant to the protection of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s public natural resources?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Does the record demonstrate a reasonable effort to reduce the environmental incursion to a minimum?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Does the environmental harm which will result from the challenged decision or action so clearly outweigh the benefits to be derived therefrom that to proceed further would be an abuse of discretion?&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>The Court held that the paving of a portion of the park to widen the highway satisfied this test and was thus permissible under the ERA. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not explicitly affirm the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s three-part test but agreed with the lower court that &ldquo;it is manifest that a balancing must take place&rdquo; between&nbsp; the environmental values protected by the ERA and other important societal values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s decision in <strong>Payne v. Kassab</strong> ushered in a nearly forty-year period of failed ERA claims. Because the first prong of the Payne test asks whether the challenged action complies with all applicable statutes and regulations, the question of whether any particular action violated the ERA effectively collapsed into the question of whether the action complied with other environmental laws. Under the Payne test, where no other law was violated, the ERA provided no additional protection for the environment. In addition, the Payne test effectively dictated that no action could violate the ERA unless the environmental harm &ldquo;clearly outweighed&rdquo; any benefit to be gained by the action. In practice, courts rarely found this to be the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other important decisions also came out of the Payne era, for example:&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Community College of Delaware County v. Fox, 342 A.2d 468 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1975)</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Residents argued that the Department of Environmental Resources (DER) violated the ERA by issuing a permit allowing the Central Delaware County Authority to expand sewer service. The residents argued that the permit would induce additional development in environmentally sensitive areas, leading to potential water pollution effects. The Commonwealth Court rejected this argument because it concluded that the ERA cannot expand the powers of a state agency like DER. Instead, the ERA operates &ldquo;only to limit such powers as have been expressly delegated by proper enabling legislation.&rdquo; The General Assembly had not given DER the authority to consider the effect of future land development when deciding whether to issue permits, so the ERA could not be used to compel DER to consider or make decisions based on such concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Robinson Township&nbsp;</h2>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Robinson Township v. Commonwealth, 83 A.3d 901 (2013)&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><br />
In 2013, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reinvigorated the ERA with its decision in <strong>Robinson Township v. Commonwealth</strong>. In this case, several municipalities, environmental advocacy organizations, and other parties challenged amendments to the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Act, known as Act 13. Among other things, the challengers argued that Act 13 violated the ERA because it forced every municipality in the Commonwealth to allow oil and gas drilling by right in all zoning districts.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In its decision, the Court opined that the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s ERA decisions up until that point had weakened the meaning of the ERA by tending to define the ERA&rsquo;s broad constitutional rights in terms of compliance with various other laws. It criticized the Payne test, saying that it was not based on the text of the ERA, improperly narrowed the scope of the ERA, and minimized the constitutional duties of the non-legislative branches of government. A better analytical scheme was needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Providing that analytical scheme, the Court explained that the ERA is structured in &ldquo;three mandatory clauses that define rights and obligations.&rdquo; The first clause establishes Pennsylvanians&rsquo; right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic values of the environment. It operates to protect the people from governmental action that unreasonably causes actual or likely deterioration of these features. This clause does not impose an express duty on the government to enact specific affirmative measures to promote clean air, pure water, and the preservation of different values of the environment, but it does impose an obligation to refrain from unduly infringing upon that right by legislative or executive action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second and third clauses work together. The second clause guarantees the common ownership of the people, including future generations, of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources. This applies to a narrower category of &ldquo;public&rdquo; natural resources than is covered by the first clause, but nevertheless implicates relatively broad aspects of the environment, including state-owned lands and other resources that &ldquo;implicate the public interest&rdquo; such as ambient air, surface and ground water, and wild plants and animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third clause establishes a public trust&mdash;a type of legal relationship whereby the Commonwealth as &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; must conserve and maintain Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources (called the &ldquo;corpus&rdquo; of the trust) for the benefit of all Pennsylvanians, present and future, referred to as &ldquo;beneficiaries&rdquo; of the trust. The Court explained that this means that the Commonwealth has a duty to conserve and maintain Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources with prudence, loyalty and impartiality. It also means that the Commonwealth must prevent and remedy degradation, diminution, and depletion of those resources, whether they occur through direct state action or due to the state&rsquo;s failure to restrain the actions of private parties. The Commonwealth&rsquo;s trustee obligations are both negative and affirmative, meaning that the Commonwealth not only has a duty to prevent degradation of public natural resources, but to act affirmatively to protect the environment by passing laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court went on to caution that the ERA does not call for a stagnant landscape, the derailment of economic or social development, or the sacrifice of other fundamental values. It is not intended to stop development. Rather, the ERA means that economic development cannot take place at the expense of unreasonable degradation of the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court also explained that the ERA imposes obligations and limitations on all branches and levels of government&mdash;including local government&mdash;because the quality of the environment is a task with both local and statewide implications. Because the ERA is a constitutional command, the General Assembly cannot take away local governments&rsquo; responsibilities under it, nor can it remove the necessary and reasonable authority local governments need to carry out their constitutional duties. Therefore, the Court held, the portion of Act 13 that removed local governments&rsquo; authority to decide where oil and gas operations may be located within their boundaries violated the ERA and must be struck down.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><br />
Post-Robinson Township&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Only three of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court&rsquo;s seven justices agreed with the reasoning in Robinson Township, although a fourth agreed with the outcome based on a different rationale. This meant that the provisions of Act 13 that forced municipalities to allow oil and gas development in all zoning districts were invalidated, but the Court&rsquo;s analysis of the ERA did not become binding precedent on lower courts. Because a majority of the Supreme Court had not conclusively rejected the Payne test, the Commonwealth Court continued to apply it for several more years, until the Supreme Court definitively rejected it in a case known as PEDF II.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>PEDF II</h2>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Pa. Envtl. Def. Found. v. Commonwealth, 161 A.3d 911 (Pa. 2017) (PEDF II)</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next significant ERA decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court came in 2017. In this case, the Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Fund (PEDF) challenged the leasing of state-owned land for oil and natural gas development and the budgetary scheme that dispersed the revenue from those leases. This scheme redirected over $330 million that would have been used for conservation purposes under prior law to the General Fund, where it was appropriated for a variety of state government purposes unrelated to maintaining and protecting public natural resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court began its analysis by decisively rejecting the Payne test, stating that it was unrelated to the text of the ERA and stripped the ERA of its meaning. This time, four Supreme Court justices agreed with this holding, finally spelling the end of the Payne test. The four-justice majority also affirmed Robinson Township&rsquo;s statement of basic ERA principles, thus solidifying those principles into binding precedent. The Court went on to elaborate on the Commonwealth&rsquo;s trustee duties, firmly grounding these in private trust law. These duties include the duty of loyalty, which imposes an obligation to manage the corpus of the trust so as to accomplish the trust&rsquo;s purposes for the benefit of the trust&rsquo;s beneficiaries, and the duty of impartiality to treat all beneficiaries equitably in light of the purposes of the trust. The Commonwealth&rsquo;s discretion as to how to handle Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources is limited by these trustee duties and the purpose of the trust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court also held that the proceeds from the sale of public natural resources, including the sale of oil and gas from public lands, are to be considered part of the corpus of the trust and must be dealt with in the same way as other public natural resources. Therefore, the Commonwealth is not entitled to spend that revenue on general budgetary items in any way it sees fit; those funds must be directed toward the purpose of the trust&mdash;conserving and maintaining Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources. Accordingly, the Court held that the budgetary provisions that took revenue generated from the sale of oil and gas on state lands and placed them in the General Fund without requiring the Commonwealth to put them toward conserving and maintaining public natural resources violated the ERA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remainder of the Court&rsquo;s decision, as well as several subsequent decisions, dealt primarily with characterizing the precise nature of the revenue generated by oil and gas leases and the precise scope of the activities that could be funded with that revenue. For example, in a later case, <strong>Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Foundation v. Commonwealth, 279 A.3d 1194 (Pa. 2022)</strong>, the Supreme Court held that a trustee is entitled to incur reasonable costs in administering the trust, and, therefore, oil and gas revenues could be used to fund general operating expenses of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources such as salaries, wages, and travel expenses for its employees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Recent Cases&nbsp;</h2>

<p>In the years since Robinson Township and the PEDF cases, Courts have tended to focus on language in those two seminal cases stating that the ERA protects only against unreasonable degradation of natural resources and &ldquo;does not call for a stagnant landscape&rdquo; or &ldquo;require a freeze of the existing natural resource stock.&rdquo; Although Payne&rsquo;s explicit balancing test has gone by the wayside, courts have continued to view the Commonwealth&rsquo;s ERA obligations in terms of a balance between the duty to maintain and conserve natural resources for the benefit of all the people and other legitimate government interests. The effect has been that, when specific government actions have been challenged, courts have focused on whether the challenged action represents an appropriate balance between environmental interests and other concerns or is instead an unreasonable degradation of the environment. In nearly all cases, courts have decided that the appropriate balance has been struck and no unreasonable degradation has or will occur. Often, these decisions have resulted from what courts or local decision-making bodies have found to be inadequate evidence of alleged environmental harms.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>One such case is <strong>Frederick v. Allegheny Twp. Zoning Hearing Bd., 196 A.3d 677 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018)</strong>. In this case, residents of Allegheny Township challenged a zoning ordinance that permitted fracking by right in all zoning districts, subject to various restrictions. The Commonwealth Court held that the challengers had not produced sufficient evidence that fracking was harmful to the environment or public health and, even if they had, Township had appropriately balanced those concerns against the economic benefits of fracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Courts have also doubled down on the principle, first articulated in <strong>Community College of Delaware County v. Fox</strong> in 1975, that the ERA does not give executive branch agencies like the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) additional powers or authority beyond what the General Assembly has given them by statute. On multiple occasions, courts have held that DEP and other agencies like it cannot create regulations, make decisions, issue or deny permits, or take any other actions based on ERA concerns if there is no state statute allowing them to do so. For example, the Commonwealth Court in <strong>Marcellus Shale Coalition v. Department of Environmental Protection, 193 A.3d 447 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018)</strong>, invalidated a regulation that required DEP to consider impacts to species of special concern when issuing permits for oil and gas development because the statute that created the permitting scheme only authorized DEP to consider impacts to endangered and threatened species.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The same applies to municipalities, who cannot act beyond the powers given to them by the General Assembly. For example, in <strong>Frederick v. Allegheny Township</strong>, the Court held that municipalities lack the power to replicate the environmental oversight that the General Assembly has conferred upon DEP and other state agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Courts continue to wrestle with the ERA and the implications of Robinson Township and PEDF II. Courts have never directly addressed what preservation of the &ldquo;scenic&rdquo; and &ldquo;esthetic&rdquo; values of the environment means. The scope of what constitutes &ldquo;public natural resources&rdquo; also remains largely unexplored. Questions remain as to the nature of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s duty to act affirmatively to protect the environment by passing laws. Few cases have delved deeply into the question of what &ldquo;prudence, loyalty, and impartiality&rdquo; look like in the context of preserving and maintaining public natural resources. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not elaborated on the proper approach to balancing the rights guaranteed by the ERA with other legitimate government interests like promoting economic development, and it is unknown whether it will approve of the two-part test created by the Commonwealth Court in Frederick Township.&nbsp;</p>

"The Delaware River has a pollution problem, and PWD can’t scare it into going away",2/23/2024,"<p>Philadelphians received a troubling email from the water department over Presidents&#39; Day weekend, threatening higher water rates. Proposed new water quality standards will require the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) to reduce the pollution it discharges into the Delaware River in order to help improve water quality and save the endangered Atlantic Sturgeon. Instead of explaining this, PWD attempted to scare its customers and policymakers by tying a cleaner Delaware River to high rates. This is unconscionably false, and the PWD&rsquo;s missive failed to mention the pollution problem in the Delaware River it helped create, and used misinformed data to rile up ratepayers. If you got this email, you may have asked yourself, &quot;Why is my water department telling me that the benefits of clean water don&#39;t outweigh the costs?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Excuse Me, How Much?</strong></h3>

<p>PWD operates three wastewater treatment plants on the River:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Northeast Water Pollution Control Plant</li>
	<li>Southeast Water Pollution Control Plant</li>
	<li>Southwest Water Pollution Control Plant</li>
</ul>

<p>It needs to upgrade these plants to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&rsquo;s proposed new water quality standards. In its recent communications to ratepayers, PWD alleged that these upgrades would cost $3 billion and that PWD would raise rates by $265 per year to pay for them. These amounts are outdated, based on false assumptions, and designed to make Philadelphians afraid.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What Happened: The EPA&#39;s Involvement in the Delaware River</strong></h3>

<p>In December 2022, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-and-Partners-Convince-EPA-to-Upgrade-Delaware-River-Water-Quality-Standards"">EPA granted PennFuture&rsquo;s and our partners&#39; petition</a> for a rulemaking to establish new water quality standards under the Clean Water Act for dissolved oxygen in the urban Delaware River. In layman&rsquo;s terms, the wastewater treatment plants along the Delaware River are old and using outdated technology. As a result, they fail to capture all of the pollution that enters it and instead dump that pollution into the river, including dangerous substances like ammonia, which dramatically lowers the amount of oxygen in the river through a process called &ldquo;nitrification.&rdquo; This ensures that the river is not suitable for most wildlife to live&mdash;including the endangered Atlantic Sturgeon&mdash;as well as people to use the river for recreation. In other words, this pollution leads to the Delaware River being a deadzone in and around Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Then, in December 2023, <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/21/2023-27758/water-quality-standards-to-protect-aquatic-life-in-the-delaware-river"">EPA released a draft of revised standards for public comment</a>. With barely 48 hours remaining in the comment period, PWD chose to push out misleading information to its ratepayers, attacking the science behind the new standards, and claiming that it would enact exorbitant rate increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is misinformation. PWD&#39;s scare tactics, financial threats, and &quot;either/or&quot; mindset do a disservice to Philadelphians who deserve a clean and healthy river. Philadelphians should not have to worry about whether their water provider is trying to fight against clean water.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Science is Clear!&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The major government agencies&mdash;EPA and the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC)&mdash; that watch over the Delaware River agree. Wildlife, including the endangered Atlantic Sturgeon, live in the urban reaches of the Delaware River, and they need higher <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/indicators-dissolved-oxygen"">dissolved oxygen</a> regularly to thrive. Stronger water quality standards that reduce pollution in the river and increase dissolved oxygen levels are essential to restore these majestic creatures to full population health, protect other fish vital to the river ecosystem, and support recreational and commercial fishing. You can read more about this in <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2024.2.20%2DFinal%2DJoint%2DEPA%2DProposed%2DWQS%2DComments.pdf"">PennFuture&rsquo;s comments</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, getting the water to hold higher dissolved oxygen levels does not happen overnight. The dissolved oxygen levels in the Delaware River are low because of discharges from wastewater treatment plants.</p>

<p>To prevent this nitrification process from happening in the Delaware River, PWD needs to upgrade their wastewater treatment plants. The plants need to reduce the amount of ammonia they discharge, or nitrify it, before discharging it so it won&#39;t pull dissolved oxygen out of the Delaware River.</p>

<h3><strong>PWD&#39;s Eye-Popping $3 Billion Cost Estimate Is Too Bad To Be True</strong></h3>

<p>PWD&rsquo;s email to ratepayers told them that it would cost $3 billion to upgrade its three facilities. That number sounds shocking. PWD <a href=""https://delawarecurrents.org/2021/03/24/delaware-river-dissolved-oxygen/"">linked to some sources</a> connecting to a report that the <a href=""https://www.nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/NitrogenReductionCostEstimates_KleinfelderJan2021.pdf"">DRBC commissioned in 2021</a> to estimate conservative upgrade costs for PWD&rsquo;s plants, under four possible scenarios&ndash;and PWD&rsquo;s number only looks at the most expensive one. Again, this number is not based on the cost of the actual proposed regulation. A more realistic estimate would look at the specific requirements of the proposed regulation. What PWD has done here is like getting a single quote for a home-improvement project where you include every possible upgrade, just to see how much it&rsquo;d all cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Importantly, EPA provided a different estimate for the costs of upgrading. <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/21/2023-27758/water-quality-standards-to-protect-aquatic-life-in-the-delaware-river"">EPA&#39;s estimate</a> for upgrading all of the impacted wastewater treatment plants&mdash;only three of which are PWD&rsquo;s&mdash;is $137 million per year. Let&rsquo;s repeat that: That is $137 million for all the plants along this stretch of the Delaware. EPA estimates that PWD&rsquo;s three plants will require approximately $78 million per year. But PWD told ratepayers it needs $3 billion for just its three plants and didn&rsquo;t provide ratepayers any sense of what that could mean per year. The math doesn&rsquo;t add up!</p>

<p>PWD didn&rsquo;t tell ratepayers, but later in the week wrote in its official comments to EPA, that it commissioned its own studies to get its own cost estimates. However, PWD hasn&rsquo;t made it clear what the basis is for its estimates. Without understanding how PWD got to the numbers it did, it is hard for anyone else to evaluate what the costs are and how to pay for them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Why Water Rates Don&#39;t Need To Increase</strong></h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker: PWD does not have to raise rates to pay for all of these upgrades. It can take advantage of significant state and federal infrastructure funding. Funds are available through several federal programs&mdash;the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and other sources&mdash;to make the necessary improvements to its wastewater treatment plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Municipalities and utilities like PWD have the opportunity to access federal funds for system upgrades. On February 20, 2024, <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-58-billion-president-bidens-investing-america"">the Biden administration announced over $5.8 billion</a> for states, Tribes, and territories to invest in drinking water and clean water infrastructure upgrades. The funding focuses on essential water infrastructure that protects public health and treasured water bodies nationwide. Almost half of this funding will be available as grants or principal forgiveness loans, ensuring funds reach underserved communities most in need of investments in water infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In total, the Biden administration has invested $50 billion in the nation&#39;s water infrastructure through the BIL. Pennsylvania&#39;s water infrastructure has already benefited&mdash;<a href=""https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-200-million-pennsylvania-drinking-water"">receiving $782,982,000 in investments from the BIL since 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ARPA is another source of federal funds. Philadelphia received $1.4 billion from the federal government via ARPA to assist with relief efforts related to the COVID-19 pandemic and recession, and to invest in its water infrastructure. <strong>Philadelphia</strong> <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/2022-11-03-what-the-american-rescue-plan-means-for-philadelphia/""><strong>must allocate $449 million by the end of this year</strong></a>. <strong>To date, it has not done so</strong>.</p>

<p>Philadelphia can use the ARPA funding to invest in long-term upgrades to our aging water infrastructure system and reduce the need to fund these projects through debt service or rate increases. It can do all this without negatively impacting PWD&rsquo;s ability to borrow money at the most favorable rates.</p>

<p>Indeed, PWD has already planned to do at least a portion of this work. PWD intends to <a href=""https://water.phila.gov/drops/virtual-presentation-for-planned-deammonification/"">build a sidestream treatment facility</a> to reduce the ammonia load moving through the Southwest Water Pollution Control Plant. PWD&#39;s own estimates are that this sidestream plant will solve 10% of the ammonia problem by itself. PWD plans to pay for this through a grant from Pennsylvania&#39;s PENNVEST fund, not through an increase in water rates.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Philadelphia Can&mdash;And Should&mdash;Have Both a Healthy Delaware AND Affordable Water Rates</strong></h3>

<p>PWD&rsquo;s actions to set up a false narrative is a loss for us all and greatly reduces our confidence in its ability to manage Philadelphia&rsquo;s aging water system. To start rebuilding trust, PWD should publicly rescind its e-mail and update its information to reflect the truth&mdash;upgrading its three wastewater treatment plants is necessary and can be done without raising water rates.</p>

<p>We all want the same thing&mdash;a healthy Delaware and affordable water rates. Instead of fear-mongering, PWD should figure out how to make the river cleaner and healthier and what resources are available to help fund that work. PennFuture will continue to hold PWD accountable for equitable rates and a healthy and productive Delaware River. Millions of people use the river for recreation, food, and work. Our goal is to ensure they can do so for years to come.</p>

"Zoning, Not Popular Vote, Should Determine 'Warehouse' Development",2/8/2024,"<div><span style=""white-space: normal;"">A recently-proposed bill in the Pennsylvania legislature has attracted the attention of residents concerned about the proliferation of logistics facilities such as warehouses and distribution centers. This bill (HB 1960), proposed by Rep. Emrick of Lower Nazareth, Northampton County, would subject local land development approval of certain warehouses and distribution centers to a public referendum, effectively giving the public standardless veto power over this type of development. While this bill reflects an admirable response to community outcry and a desire for more control over a form of development that can cause significant traffic, aesthetic, health, and environmental impacts, the mechanism it offers misses the mark.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>To see why this is the case, consider an illustration: You are driving through an unfamiliar town and see that the posted speed limit is 45 mph. You are cruising along at 40 mph and obeying all known traffic laws, so you are surprised when a police officer pulls you over and writes you a ticket. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem, officer?&rdquo; you ask, &ldquo;The sign says the speed limit is 45 mph. I was only going 40 and haven&rsquo;t done anything else illegal that I know of.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; says the police officer, &ldquo;but, we have a law that says that a driver can be ticketed if local residents don&rsquo;t approve of the way they are driving, even if they are following the traffic laws. Some of the folks who live on this street called the station and said they didn&rsquo;t like how fast you were going, so I have to write you a ticket.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; you exclaim. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me I can get a ticket just because local residents &lsquo;don&rsquo;t like&rsquo; how I&rsquo;m driving?! How am I supposed to know what kind of driving they&rsquo;ll approve of? What keeps me from getting a ticket just because they don&rsquo;t like my car or the way I look?! How do I know they won&rsquo;t change their mind about what they approve of next time I drive through here?! If they wanted the speed limit to be lower, they should have gotten the law changed and put up new signs!&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; says the police officer with a shrug, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re the ones who live here and they agreed they don&rsquo;t like the way you&rsquo;re driving today, so that&rsquo;s the way it is. Have a nice day.&rdquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></div>

<div>If you were this driver, you would be right to think this was unfair. Most of us understand that we have a right to know ahead of time whether our actions are lawful and what specific standards we must follow to comply with the law. We have a right not to be subject to the whims of our neighbors on a case-by-case basis. In fact, this right is so fundamental to our understanding of how society works that it is enshrined in a constitutional amendment that prohibits deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. In the context of land development, due process means that a person&rsquo;s right to use and develop their property cannot be subject to arbitrary, standardless, case-by-case decision making, even if the decision makers are neighbors and community members.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style=""white-space: pre; white-space: normal;""> </span></div>

<div>This is why the type of public referendum put forth by HB 1960 cannot be the mechanism used to control logistics development. Neither landowners nor the community would know ahead of time what type of development would be permitted, and voters could reject or approve a proposed development for any number of reasons, including unfair and unlawful ones. Voters could reject a proposed development simply because they don&rsquo;t think the developer is the &ldquo;right&rdquo; kind of person, because they think their brother-in-law should get to develop the property instead, or because they think a different type of development would be more attractive or personally beneficial to them. Public referendums would also invite unsavory politicking by developers, who may try to influence voting with bribes or other unlawful incentives. All of this would amount to a deprivation of property rights in violation of due process.</div>

<div>But neighbors and community members do have a say in how our communities are developed. Communities&rsquo; ability to guide and control logistics development resides not in public veto power over individual projects, but, as it always has, in municipalities&rsquo; power to adopt zoning and land development ordinances. These ordinances set forth the standards governing land use and development so that everyone&ndash;land developers, decision-makers, and community members alike&ndash;know the rules ahead of time and apply them fairly to all comers. Clear standards, set forth in ordinances and applied by local decision-making bodies in public proceedings, prevent the kind of &ldquo;arbitrary and capricious&rdquo; decision-making that results from standardless public referendums. Landowners can consult ordinances and know with confidence what will and will not be permitted on their land, and neighboring community members can consult them to see what kind of land use and development they can reasonably expect on nearby properties.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style=""white-space: pre; white-space: normal;""> </span></div>

<div>Although ordinances may not seem as &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; as a direct public vote on individual logistics development projects, they can accomplish the same goals while keeping the appropriate constitutional safeguards in place. Through ordinances, municipalities can dictate where within a municipality logistics uses may be constructed and impose restrictions to ensure that the significant impacts caused by these facilities are appropriately minimized and mitigated. Pennsylvania residents who are concerned about the impacts of logistics development on their communities should encourage their local officials to review their land use ordinances and determine whether updates are necessary to appropriately control this development. PennFuture has drafted a <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Publications/PennFuture_Ordinance_Manual_7.pdf"">model ordinance and guidebook</a> as well as a community toolkit for just this purpose.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style=""white-space: pre; white-space: normal;""> </span></div>

<div>PennFuture applauds state and local officials like Rep. Emrick who have engaged with the issue of logistics development and listened to community members who desire more control over this highly impactful form of land use. While public referendums may not be the solution, Pennsylvania municipalities and residents still have the power to guide and control this development while protecting their communities and the environment from harm. We will continue to work with community members and state and local elected officials to see that this is accomplished.&nbsp;</div>

Mapping Climate Change By Viewing USDA's Plant Hardiness Zones,12/1/2023,"<div>This month, the USDA released the first update to its <a href=""https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/"">Plant Hardiness Zone Map</a> in more than a decade, providing a stark, full-color depiction of the progress of climate change.</div>

<div><span style=""white-space: pre; white-space: normal;""> </span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map divides the country into thirteen hardiness zones based on the annual extreme minimum winter temperature at each location. The extreme minimum winter temperature reflects the average of the coldest temperature reached in a location for each year over a specified time period and provides a reasonable estimate of the lowest temperature one can expect at that location each year. Each hardiness zone covers ten degrees Fahrenheit and is broken into two five-degree half-zones (e.g. zone 5 is divided it half-zones 5a and 5b). <strong>Gardeners and growers use this information to determine which perennial plants are likely to thrive at a location, and the USDA Risk Management Agency uses it to set crop insurance standards. Scientists also use this data to model the spread of exotic weeds and insects.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The 2023 map is based on the average lowest annual winter temperature for the 30-year period from 1991 to 2020 and incorporates data from more than 13,412 weather stations nationwide. Compared to earlier versions of the map, the 2023 map shows that many hardiness zones have shifted significantly over time. In fact, between 2012 and 2023, about half the country, including much of Pennsylvania, has shifted a half-zone warmer. For example, the 2012 map, based on data from 1976 to 2005, places nearly all of Lancaster County in Zone 6b, with an average extreme minimum winter temperature between -5 &deg;F and 0 &deg;F . <strong>The new 2023 map shows that the average extreme minimum winter temperature in Lancaster County is now five degrees warmer, placing the county in Zone 7a. Harrisburg, Erie, Scranton, Reading, the Poconos, and much of southwest PA similarly have shifted a half-zone warmer from their 2012 zones.&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Plant3.jpg"" style=""width: 940px; height: 788px;"" /></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Comparing the 2023 map to the 1990 map, which is based on data from 1974 to 1986, (link here: <a href=""https://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-pennsylvania-usda-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php"">Pennsylvania Interactive 1990 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map</a>)&nbsp;shows an even more dramatic shift. In 1990, approximately half the Commonwealth fell into Zones 4b or 5, with average extreme minimum temperature ranging from -25 &deg;F to -10 &deg;F. Now, only a small portion of the northernmost counties remains in Zone 5b, and no part of the Commonwealth remains in Zone 5a or 4b. This means not only that the coldest temperature one can expect to experience anywhere in Pennsylvania is now ten degrees warmer than it was in 1990, but that the portion of the Commonwealth that will experience these cold temperatures is severely reduced.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>While home gardeners may welcome the extended growing season that comes with warmer weather,<strong> this data signals trouble for some native plants. </strong>A number of native plant species such as balsam fir, and bog laurel and creeping snowberry are already at the far southern fringe of their remaining habitat in Pennsylvania. Research by the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program has designated these and more than a dozen other native plant species as &ldquo;extremely vulnerable&rdquo; to warming temperatures. Many of these species, including the white-fringed orchid, the leafy bog aster, bog rosemary, and Labrador tea grow only in bog or wetland habitats that are highly vulnerable to loss or reduction with climate changes..&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Warmer temperatures also allow invasive insect species that prey on native plants to thrive. For example, the emerald ash borer is an invasive insect that poses a serious threat to the 308 million ash trees in Pennsylvania forests. Cold temperatures help reduce the number of emerald ash borer larvae that survive the winter, but significant larvae die off does not occur until temperatures fall to -10 &deg;F. The 2023 Plant Hardiness Zones Map indicates that the portion of Pennsylvania that can expect to experience temperatures this low has shrunk dramatically since 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Similarly, low winter temperature has a dynamic role in impacting the range and population of the hemlock woolly adelgid, an invasive insect that has infected, weakened, and killed an enormous number of the Pennsylvania state tree, the eastern hemlock. The destruction of hemlocks by this pest has greatly affected Pennsylvania&rsquo;s forest habitats and streams by reducing shelter for wildlife and warming unshaded streams. This, in turn, threatens aquatic species that depend on cooler water such as brook trout, rainbow trout, and the eastern hellbender. Like the emerald ash borer, hemlock woolly adelgids can survive subfreezing temperatures, but their survival rate drops off significantly once temperatures dip below zero, and most will die when temperatures reach -10 &deg;F. As the map below illustrates, as fewer locations experience the extreme cold necessary to keep the population in check, the woolly adelgid&rsquo;s range creeps ever northward, threatening more of these beautiful emblems of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s natural beauty and diversity.</div>

Climate Disruption on Trial: A Major Victory for Environmental Rights in Montana,11/15/2023,"<p>On August 14, 2023, a Montana state trial court decided that the legislature violated the people&#39;s constitutional right to a &quot;clean and healthful environment&quot; by exempting climate change from the standard environmental review to which major projects are subject. It did so after a week-long trial in which the state made no serious effort to challenge the scientific validity of human-caused climate disruption.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>While many climate cases are pending, Held v. Montana is the first constitutional climate decision in the U.S. based on a trial&mdash;and climate disruption lost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story is not over because Montana&#39;s attorney general has appealed the decision to the state&#39;s supreme court. But that court has already held that two other legislative exemptions to environmental laws violate the right to a &ldquo;clean and healthful environment.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Background On Held v. Montana</strong></h3>

<p>The case began in March 2020 when 16 Montana youth filed suit. Since 1971, the Montana Environmental Policy Act has required the state to assess the environmental impact of proposed major state actions that may significantly affect the environment. More recently, the legislature adopted an exemption to that act. As the trial court explained, the exemption &quot;bars agencies from considering [greenhouse gas] emissions and climate impacts for any project or proposal, even to assess whether the project complies with the Montana Constitution.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
In its decision, the trial court made detailed findings of fact about:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The impact of climate change on Montana&#39;s environment</li>
	<li>The harm climate change is causing plaintiffs</li>
	<li>How defendants&#39; actions contribute to both climate change and harm to the plaintiffs</li>
	<li>How the MEPA exemption contributes to that harm and prevents full review of technologically and economically available alternatives to fossil fuels in Montana&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>A Constitutional Right to a &ldquo;Clean and Healthful Environment&rdquo;</strong></h3>

<p>The court held that the plaintiffs &quot;have a fundamental constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, which includes climate as part of the environmental life-support system.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The exemption infringes on that right, the court held, and thus is subject to strict scrutiny. Under Montana constitutional law, a law (like this exemption) that infringes on a fundamental right can still be constitutional if it survives strict scrutiny review. To do so, the law must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The state did not provide any evidence on this issue. Therefore, the trial court held the exemption to be unconstitutional and enjoined the state from acting in accordance with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Montana%2D%281%29.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 640px;"" /></p>

<h3><strong>Previous Cases</strong></h3>

<p>On the merits, the attorney general&#39;s appeal must address prior Montana Supreme Court decisions that appear to weigh strongly against the state.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Montana Environmental Information Center v. Department of Environmental Quality (1999), the state legislature exempted arsenic discharges from groundwater pumping tests from review under the state&#39;s water quality nondegradation statute. The plaintiffs claimed the exemption violated their right to a &quot;clean and healthful environment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>They demonstrated that the tests would increase the concentration of arsenic in the receiving water above the concentration that would have required review under the nondegradation statute. The exemption, the state&#39;s Supreme Court held, thus intrudes on the plaintiffs&#39; right to a &quot;clean and healthful environment.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In a later case, Park County Environmental Council v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality (2020), the Montana Supreme Court held that a legislative exemption to MEPA violated the right to a&quot; clean and healthful environment.&quot; The amendment barred courts from issuing injunctions to prevent violations of MEPA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, the Department of Environmental Quality approved an exploration permit for mining in the Yellowstone River watershed 15 miles from Yellowstone National Park. However, its MEPA analysis did not adequately analyze wildlife and water quality effects. Under the statutory amendment, the company would have been able to continue conducting exploration activities while the MEPA defects were being corrected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The court held the amendment unconstitutional on its face, using strict scrutiny analysis, because it removed &quot;the Plaintiffs&#39; only available remedy adequate to prevent potential constitutionally-proscribed environmental harms.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>A Supreme Court Victory Won&#39;t Stop Fossil Fuel Project Approvals</strong></h3>

<p>MEPA requires environmental impacts to be considered before a decision.&nbsp; But if the state considers these impacts, MEPA does not stop the state from approving a fossil fuel project that will be environmentally damaging. So even if the plaintiffs win on appeal, coal mines, gas wells, and oil and gas pipelines may continue to be approved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the state would be required to provide public information about the climate change impacts of these projects and alternatives to them.&nbsp; This information is likely to have some negative effect on these projects.&nbsp; Otherwise, the legislature would not likely have passed the exemption.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Montana%2D%282%29.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 640px;"" /><br />
&nbsp;</h3>

<h3><strong>How the Montana Case Relates to Pennsylvania&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s constitution (Article I, Section 27) recognizes that the people have a right to &ldquo;clean air, pure water,&rdquo; and the preservation of certain environmental values.&nbsp; This is similar to the right to a &ldquo;clean and healthful environment&rdquo; in Montana.&nbsp; Article I, Section 27 also requires the Commonwealth to &ldquo;conserve and maintain&rdquo; public natural resources for the benefit of present and future generations. There is nothing like that in Montana&rsquo;s constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has no statute like MEPA. Still, Article I, Section 27 could be an effective tool to address climate change.&nbsp; Robert McKinstry, an environmental attorney, and I have argued that in an article.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In a recent case, petitioners challenged a PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) regulation that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from major power plants. They allege that this regulation, which would enable Pennsylvania to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), was not authorized by the state&#39;s Air Pollution Control Act. The Commonwealth Court agreed with them and issued a preliminary injunction against the regulation in 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>On appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme court, the Widener Commonwealth Environmental Law and Sustainability Center and Robert McKinstry, as well as PennFuture, supported the regulation.&nbsp; In separate friend-of-the-court briefs, we argued that DEP has statutory authority and that Article I, Section 27 supports the state&#39;s authority to adopt this regulation. A decision on that appeal is pending.</p>

<p>On November 1, the Commonwealth Court issued a permanent injunction against the RGGI regulation. Governor Josh Shapiro has 30 days to appeal that decision to the PA Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Constitutional provisions like those in Montana and Pennsylvania are not silver bullets for fighting climate change. But they can play an essential role in the effort.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture Appeals Zoning Approval of Commercial Development in EV Watershed,10/27/2023,"<p>Yesterday, PennFuture <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2023.10.26---Notice-of-Land-Use-Appeal.pdf"">filed a notice of land use appeal </a>in the Monroe County Court of Common Pleas challenging the decision of the Paradise Township Board of Supervisors granting conditional use approval for a&nbsp; resort and shopping center on the banks of two Exceptional Value (EV) streams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short, while we support the development of a resort that actually considers and attempts to minimize its impacts on the surrounding environment, community, and EV waters, we filed this appeal to hold the Township accountable to its own zoning ordinances and the law. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Logistics-Facilities-are-Coming-Is-Your-Municipality-Ready-PennFuture-Releases-Model-Logistics-Use-Ordinance-and-Guidebook"">Having proactive and thoughtful zoning on the books</a> is one of the most important things municipalities can do to protect us from unreasonable impacts, but those zoning ordinances are only useful if the municipality actually applies them and holds developers accountable to the requirements therein.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Background &ndash; Paradise Township&rsquo;s Resort Development Overlay District&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In August 2022, New York-based developer JSPA Realty, LLC submitted a zoning application to Paradise Township, Monroe County. The developer seeks to build a resort and shopping center on a 240-acre parcel along the banks of Indian Run and Swiftwater Creek, two of the Poconos&rsquo; Exceptional Value streams. The property is located in Paradise Township&rsquo;s Resort Development Area Overlay District, a special zoning district that permits resorts to be combined with a variety of other types of uses such as shopping centers to create integrated developments called &ldquo;Master Developments.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The overlay district is a well-crafted ordinance that facilitates development that diversifies the Township&rsquo;s economy and enhances the tourism industry that has attracted people to the Poconos for over 100 years while also conserving existing stream water quality and other natural features. To accomplish this balance between economic development and protection of the environment and the surrounding community, the zoning ordinance requires the various uses within Master Developments to be &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; with one another and to meet a variety of other requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Master Developments like the one proposed by the developer are conditional uses in the Resort Development Overlay District. This means that the Township Board of Supervisors must hold a hearing to decide if the development can be approved. This is an important stage of the land use approval process where the developer must &ldquo;show its work&rdquo; and demonstrate how its proposal satisfies all the applicable requirements of the zoning ordinance. A developer who does not demonstrate at the hearing how they will go about satisfying the zoning ordinance requirements is not entitled to approval.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Township Approved the Proposal Despite Lack of Integration Between Resort and Shopping Center&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>PennFuture participated in nine hearings on the proposed development. Based on the evidence presented at these hearings, we concluded that the resort is the type of thoughtful, well-designed development that PennFuture supports in the Poconos. The developer&rsquo;s plans and testimony show a project that respects the natural landscape and the exceptional value waterways by minimizing impervious coverage and shaping development around the existing contours of the land. The developer also proposes stormwater and wastewater treatment facilities that will return water to the ground without discharging it into the nearby streams. While we will continue to watchdog the DEP permitting of the project to ensure protection of the EV streams, we believe the resort as proposed will allow visitors to experience the natural beauty of the area, as visitors to the Poconos have for decades, without unduly harming it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The shopping center is another story. In order to be allowed in the district, the shopping center must be integrated with the resort as one &ldquo;Master Development.&rdquo; After hearing all the evidence, we concluded that the resort and shopping center were not &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; as required. The Paradise Township Board of Supervisors agreed and found that the developer failed to show how it would comply with this and various other requirements of the zoning ordinance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This should have been the end of the story, and the conditional use application should have been denied for these reasons. However, the Board approved the application anyway, believing that the developer could make up for the shortcomings later by complying with certain conditions the Board placed on the approval.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Municipalities Must Require Developers to Show Their Work Before Development is Approved&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>This is why PennFuture appealed the decision. Pennsylvania law is clear: A developer must show how its proposal will comply with the zoning ordinance at the time the application is submitted. This is why conditional use hearings exist&mdash;for a developer to demonstrate to the municipality and the public precisely how it will meet the ordinance requirements. A township cannot approve an application based on a developer&rsquo;s promise to &ldquo;work things out&rdquo; in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is vital that municipalities follow the rules that govern the land use approval process, especially in our special protection watersheds and other sensitive environmental areas. Paradise Township has taken an important first step by enacting an ordinance that appropriately balances protection of the natural environment and the economic needs of the community. However, good ordinances are ineffective if municipalities do not take the next step and ensure that developers follow them. We know that protecting our Exceptional Value waters means municipalities must require developers to &ldquo;show their work&rdquo; before those municipalities approve development, and we will do our best to watchdog local municipalities and hold them accountable should they compromise the health of our environment and communities by failing to follow their own local zoning.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

How RGGI Can Help PA Meet EPA’s New Carbon Emission Reduction Standards,10/24/2023,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) solicited comments on a proposed rule that will limit the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that can be released by new and modified fossil-fuel power plants.&nbsp;When the comment period closed on August 8, 2023, over 1.1 million comments had been submitted. According to the EPA, power plants account for at least 25 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere, which is nearly twice as much as homes and small business contributions combined.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In its proposed rule, the EPA found that a technology called carbon capture and storage (CCS) could be used to achieve a 90 percent capture of GHG emissions.&nbsp;CCS involves the capture of carbon emissions from power plants and storing them underground or in the ocean.&nbsp;There are many concerns involved in the use of CCS.&nbsp;The technology is not widely used and will be more expensive for power plants to install than clean energy alternatives such as solar generation.&nbsp;More information about carbon capture and the EPA&rsquo;s proposed carbon rule can be found here.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the EPA has designated CCS as the best system of emission reduction (BSER), this does not mean it is the only method states can use to achieve 90 percent emission reduction.&nbsp; States are not required to &ldquo;compel regulated sources to adopt the particular components of the BSER itself,&rdquo; which means states are not required to use CCS to achieve the EPA&rsquo;s emission guidelines.&nbsp;The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is one potential cost-effective method of reaching the EPA&rsquo;s target.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What is RGGI?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Thirteen regional states currently use RGGI to reduce GHG emissions and control the amount of pollution released by power plants.&nbsp;RGGI&nbsp;is a cap-and-trade program that limits the amount of GHG emissions power plants can release.&nbsp;The program was started in 2005 with seven member states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont.&nbsp;Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Maryland joined two years later in 2007 and Virginia joined RGGI in 2020.&nbsp;RGGI has successfully reduced GHG emissions in these states by more than 50 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>How does RGGI work?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>RGGI allows participating states to establish a regional cap on carbon dioxide emissions and each state creates allowances based on its share of the regional cap.&nbsp;Power plants with at least one generator with a capacity of 25 MW are required to purchase allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions at quarterly auctions.&nbsp;Each allowance enables the power plant to emit one ton of carbon dioxide.&nbsp;These auctions also allow states to track emission levels from individual power plants and ensure that they are paying for the emissions they create.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>RGGI allows the competitive market to standardize the cost of each allowance power plants purchase.&nbsp;Allowances are distributed to power plants from the highest bidder to the lowest bidder.&nbsp;Once all the allowances are allocated, each power plant pays the same amount for their allowances which is based on the lowest bid from the auction.&nbsp;RGGI rules include safeguards at these auctions to ensure that allowance prices fall within a designated price range to provide market stability.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>RGGI operates in three-year cycles.&nbsp;To remain compliant under RGGI, power plants must purchase enough allowances to cover fifty percent of their emissions for the first two years in a cycle.&nbsp; Additional allowances are purchased during quarterly auctions or in limited cases from the secondary market.&nbsp;Power plants can roll over any unused allowances and use them during a three-year cycle.&nbsp;In the third year, known as the control period, power plants must surrender all their remaining allowances, including any unused allowances from years one and two.&nbsp;The control period in RGGI creates an incentive for power plants to purchase fewer allowances to prevent surrendering them at the end of the three-year period, and in turn, encourages them to reduce their carbon emissions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>RGGI creates benefits beyond carbon dioxide reduction.&nbsp;The revenue generated from quarterly auctions is invested back into the community through &ldquo;energy efficiency, renewable energy, direct energy bill assistance, and other greenhouse gas reduction programs.&rdquo;&nbsp;RGGI generated $374 million in 2021 alone, with 51 percent of the investment focused on energy efficiency.&nbsp; States that participate in RGGI are experiencing a double benefit from the program; a reduction in GHG emissions and a revenue source to fund programs to improve their energy sectors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What About Pennsylvania?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>On April 23, 2022, Pennsylvania published its CO2 Budget Trading Program allowing the State to participate in the RGGI market.&nbsp;This signaled a commitment from Pennsylvania that it was taking ownership of its responsibility to reduce GHG emissions and address its contribution to climate change.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the polluters from the coal industry and their allies in the legislature challenged the rule and brought an action in State court requesting that the law be declared unconstitutional.&nbsp;As a result of a last-minute injunction, Pennsylvania was forced to pull its allowances from the September 2022 auction and cannot participate in the RGGI auctions until the injunction is lifted or the case is resolved.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s withdrawal from RGGI has been a blow to the State&rsquo;s commitment to fight climate change but has also had financial repercussions.&nbsp;Over a billion dollars in energy investment funds may have been lost while Pennsylvania awaits a court decision on the constitutionality of RGGI.&nbsp;Participating RGGI states have prevented the release of 4.4 million tons of carbon dioxide, which also creates a reduction in other pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, and particulate matter.&nbsp;Citizens of these states have directly benefited from the $1.2 billion in lifetime energy bill savings.&nbsp;While other states are reaping the rewards of RGGI participation, Pennsylvania is being left behind.&nbsp;The absence of state regulation allows power plants in Pennsylvania to continue to pollute the air we breathe without any accountability and without paying a cent.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>RGGI is Right for Pennsylvania?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Citizens across the State of Pennsylvania are feeling the effects of power plant pollution and paying the price with their health.&nbsp;The Shenango Coke Plant was closed on Neville Island near Pittsburgh in 2016.&nbsp;Coking plants are fueled by coke derived from coal and emit similar pollutants to power plants.&nbsp;A recent study conducted by New York University has shown that the plant&rsquo;s closure created a 90 percent decrease in sulfur pollution and local residents experienced an immediate 42 percent reduction in emergency room visits.&nbsp;Those visits further declined by 62 percent after the plant was closed for three years.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s anticipated that additional health benefits including a decrease in asthma cases and cardiovascular disease, will be realized as more time passes since the plant&rsquo;s closure.&nbsp;With both coking and power plants scattered across the State, even a reduction in pollution emissions from these plants could vastly improve the health of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s citizens.&nbsp;RGGI could create these reductions with the added benefit of generating investment funds for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean energy infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In just a few short weeks, the September RGGI auction will take place without Pennsylvania&rsquo;s participation. Power plants in Pennsylvania will continue to emit harmful pollutants into our air and advance the climate change disaster that is being felt across the world.&nbsp;RGGI could not only provide a solution to this problem but would make it possible for Pennsylvania to comply with the 90 percent carbon emission reduction included in the EPA&rsquo;s proposed carbon rule.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>We can only hope the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will uphold RGGI and the State can participate in the December 2023 auction, although it is unlikely the case will be resolved in time.&nbsp; Pennsylvanians deserve to reap the benefits enjoyed by other participating RGGI states in our region.&nbsp;Power plants need to be held responsible for the harmful emissions they release into the air we breathe.&nbsp;The State could utilize RGGI to create accountability and force power plants to reduce their GHG emissions, which would improve the health and quality of life for all Pennsylvanians.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

"Riparian Buffers: a Natural, Inexpensive, and Crucial Way to Protect and Improve Water Quality",10/18/2023,"<h3><strong>What are riparian buffers?</strong></h3>

<p><br />
Riparian buffers are the areas of undeveloped land surrounding bodies of water that contain trees, shrubs, and other plants. Riparian buffers protect water quality and create wildlife habitat along creeks, streams, rivers, and wetlands. They offer valuable ecosystem services to nearby human communities, and they act as both an economic driver and financial saver for these communities.<br />
Riparian buffers serve many roles. They provide habitat for wildlife and maintain cool water temperatures to support aquatic life, like trout. They act as sponges, soaking up stormwater runoff, which reduces the occurrence and impact of flooding. They also act as filters by purifying that stormwater, removing contaminants like road salt and vehicle fluids that can get carried into waterways during heavy rainfall events.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Benefits of riparian buffers to PA&rsquo;s waters and communities</strong></h3>

<p><br />
Pennsylvania&#39;s waterways are under threat. <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/CleanWater/WaterQuality/IntegratedWatersReport/Pages/2022-Integrated-Water-Quality-Report.aspx"">More than 30% of Pennsylvania&#39;s 86,000 stream miles are so polluted that the DEP considers them &quot;impaired&rdquo;</a> - meaning that they are too polluted to meet the standards set for them. This includes rivers like the Lehigh, which was named one of the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;Most Endangered Rivers&rdquo; in April 2023. What&#39;s more, only 2% of Pennsylvania&#39;s stream miles are clean enough to be designated as Exceptional Value, having the best and most protected water quality in the state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stormwater runoff is the major source of water pollution across the state. Stormwater carries with it pollution such as sediment, nutrients, and even toxic chemicals. This is especially true where chemicals such as fertilizers or manure are inappropriately applied to the land. Moreover, large areas of impervious surfaces - like parking lots and roofs of industrial buildings - shed stormwater quickly, increasing the likelihood of flooding. If not properly managed, stormwater harms our waters by increasing both the type and amount of pollutants that enter the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters.</p>

<p>In addition to the environmental and ecological benefits described above, riparian buffers provide a wide range of ecosystem services, which benefit surrounding human communities. These services include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Capturing and storing carbon in vegetation and soils, which helps regulate the climate and clean the air.</li>
	<li>Mitigating the negative effects of land use, including commercial or industrial development.</li>
	<li>Reducing the cost of and stress on water treatment infrastructure by trapping sediment and pollutants before they reach the water.</li>
	<li>Decreasing soil erosion - the roots of vegetation hold soil in place, even during extreme weather events and flooding.</li>
</ul>

<p>These ecosystem services translate into real monetary value. Riparian buffers in the Delaware River Basin, alone, provide about $11,000 per acre in services each year. The social cost of carbon is approximately $50 per metric ton, so Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 219 million metric tons of CO2 of annual emissions contribute to $10.95 billion in damages every year. However, one million acres of riparian buffer around the state could offset around 70% of that figure, even without considering the other ecosystem service benefits. Case in point, riparian buffers provide up to $9,409 of carbon storage benefits per acre per year in the Delaware River Basin. Additionally, according to regional case studies, watershed conservation in New York was at least $6.5 billion cheaper than a new filtration plant; and, in the Chesapeake Bay, each pound of nitrogen abatement was nearly one-third cheaper when done by forest buffers instead of treatment plants.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>We need to do more to protect riparian buffers from destruction and development.&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>And we know that Pennsylvanians support this. Last spring, the Our Pocono Waters campaign commissioned <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.wordpress.com/2022/05/11/pocono-residents-support-more-action-to-protect-exceptional-value-streams-new-poll-finds/"">a survey</a> of community members in the headwaters of the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers. The results were overwhelming -&nbsp; 94% of residents in the Poconos want their state and local officials to do more to protect and preserve their waterways. And we see similar sentiments from communities throughout the Commonwealth, especially in relation to increased flooding and other climate impacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We know that downstream communities experience the cumulative impacts of upstream land uses, including increased, large-scale development. Protecting riparian buffers across watersheds can help mitigate some of those impacts, like flooding and degraded water quality, and can help some of our most sensitive communities from bearing the brunt of this pollution.</p>

<p>Over the years, PennFuture has prioritized stormwater management and has championed riparian buffers and other ways to protect our waters from stormwater pollution and our communities from flooding. In 2017, we drafted a <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PennFuture_StormwaterManual_web_3.20.17.pdf"">Stormwater Ordinance Manual</a> which guides communities to better safeguard water sources. In 2022, PennFuture was <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Protects-Major-River-Basins-Across-Pennsylvania-in-Stormwater-Settlement"">successful in its litigation</a> against PA DEP, Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, resulting in stronger protections from stormwater runoff in our major river basins. More recently, PennFuture successfully nominated the Lehigh River for <a href=""https://mostendangeredrivers.org/river/lehigh-river/"">American Rivers&#39; Most Endangered Rivers List of 2023</a>, and supported the publication of Our Pocono Waters&#39; <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/OurPoconoWaters_Report_FINAL_WEB-PDF_8.8.22-%28reduced%29.pdf"">&quot;Economic Effects of Special Protection Stream Designations in the Pocono Mountains Region&quot;.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Currently, we are actively supporting the passage of the Riparian Buffer Protection Act <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2023&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1275"">(HB 1275)</a>. This piece of legislation aims to safeguard Pennsylvania&#39;s pristine waterways and to invest in the health of the impaired streams impacting our communities by establishing riparian buffers for all the Commonwealths&rsquo; waterways. Laws like this help Pennsylvania &ldquo;protect the pristine and invest in the impaired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Riparian buffers and property rights</strong></h3>

<p>In response to bills like the Riparian Buffer Protection Act or local ordinances that establish riparian buffers, opponents of these natural and cost effective solutions to pollution argue that creating or increasing riparian buffers will be a &ldquo;takings.&rdquo; This argument, however, is without merit.</p>

<p>Takings are an exercise of governmental authority in restricting a property owner&rsquo;s use of his property. Taking of private property for public use is allowed by the government, but if it goes too far, then the property owner must receive &ldquo;just compensation&rdquo; for his loss of property. There is much case law and legal standards that apply to help determine when a restriction on the use of property through regulatory actions is a taking. In short, it&rsquo;s a balancing act and, on balance, riparian buffers statutes and ordinances are not a takings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regulations that prevent harm to the public or protect a public interest in quality of life and the environment, such as riparian ordinances, are traditionally considered legitimate exercises of the police power that do not constitute a taking. Additionally, many of these regulations, including the Riparian Buffer Protection Act, include exceptions for much of the work that small landowners and even developers may do on their property that could impact the riparian buffer area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Riparian buffers are an essential way for Pennsylvania to protect and improve water quality and protect landowners and communities from increased flooding across the state while also respecting the rights of property owners. This is why PennFuture supports actions, conservation measures, and legislation that establishes and protects riparian buffers in Pennsylvania.</p>

Renaming Erie’s “Summer of Soot and Sewage” to the Summer of Community Climate Solutions,9/22/2023,"<p>Last week, an article in the Erie Times-News aptly referred to Erie&#39;s summer as the &ldquo;Summer of Soot and Sewage&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Citing poor air quality resulting from widespread Canadian wildfires and numerous beach closures linked to elevated E. coli levels, reporter David Bruce described a &ldquo;double whammy of pollution.&rdquo; More research is forthcoming to understand the record E. coli-related beach closures because some, uncharacteristically, did not follow periods of intense rainfall. However, research shows us an overarching tie between elevated exposure to E. coli bacteria and increased Canadian wildlife burn acreage to a changing climate.&nbsp; With Erie being named the 7th fastest-warming city in the US and July 2023 becoming the hottest month on record globally, we can see clearly that Erie is not immune from climate impacts.</p>

<p>We are facing significant environmental challenges, and research shows we need to take action at all levels and across all sectors to prevent the worst harm. At PennFuture, we advocate to those in positions of power for policy change. However,l to succeed in this role, we rely on the efforts and stories of hardworking scientists, government employees, and social justice, environment, and labor activists, among others on the ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reflecting on Erie&rsquo;s summer, I want to highlight four community activist-led efforts that provide hope and inspiration about our ability to affect change. Based on the examples set by these community advocates, I propose we rename this recent season to the &ldquo;Summer of Community Climate Solutions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>UE Wabtec Strike &amp; the Green Locomotive Project</strong></h3>

<p>At the beginning of summer, the University of Massachusetts - Amherst Political Economy and Research Institute released a report concluding that if Wabtec committed to producing 1,000 green locomotives per year at its Lawrence Park plant, up to 5,100 well-paying jobs would be created in Erie County alone. Our partner, ReImagine Appalachia, elevated the report from the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America (UE) and their Green Locomotive Project. UE&rsquo;s Green Locomotive Project aims to create &ldquo;good union jobs, address climate change, and clean up pollution in the low-income communities and communities of color which bear the brunt of pollution from rail yards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Green Locomotive Project was a focal point of contention between UE and Wabtec during a two-month strike of UE&rsquo;s 1,400-member workforce. PennFuture stood in solidarity with UE Locals 506 and 618 in Pittsburgh and Erie, speaking in support of the Green Locomotive Project at two Erie rallies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope the efforts of UE in Erie this summer will be a catalyst for more conversations about Erie&rsquo;s position in the rapidly expanding green manufacturing sector and a more sustainable local standard for development.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3><strong>Grow Erie Groundbreaking at Savocchio Opportunity Park</strong></h3>

<p>Right around the corner from Wabtec, the persistence of East Erie residents is setting another example for climate action. On June 15th, Grow Erie, an initiative spearheaded by the Minority Community Investment Corporation (MCIC), broke ground at Savocchio Opportunity Park after 20 years of planning and persistence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Grow Erie site, a remediated brownfield, will include a new urban agriculture facility made possible by a public-private partnership of MCIC, the Erie County Redevelopment Authority, and Integrated Agriculture Systems. Planned for the site is a commercial aquaponics facility and a community greenhouse. MCIC leader Gary Horton shared his vision for Grow Erie to &ldquo;invest in our neighborhoods, provide employment opportunities, and bring locally-grown food to a food desert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lisa Thompson Sayers of the Erie Times-News summarized the potential for Grow Erie to serve as a model by concluding a recent column with, &ldquo;The nation knows Erie well as a political bellwether. When it comes to resolving some of its most damnable and intractable social, economic and environmental ills, let it be a bellwether of change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fairview, Girard Resident Opposition Leads to Defeat of Proposed Agricultural Conversion for Business Park</p>

<p>Rural Erie County advocates also claimed victory over the status quo this summer. Erie&rsquo;s history of unencumbered urban sprawl and consequent population decline from its dense community centers bore great economic, social, and economic costs. Habitat loss, increased automobile travel and emissions, and greater inequity between area school districts and communities are just some of the impacts.</p>

<p>While many in Erie understand that reinvestment in Erie County&rsquo;s community cores will bring greater benefits and return-on-investment, polarized politics can get in the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The West County Citizens Coalition advocacy shows that the situation is more nuanced at the ground level. A dozen Girard and Fairview Township residents rallied the support of over 1,500 people to fight against converting agricultural land to a business park. Their advocacy, citing concerns of insufficient public transparency and resident engagement, increased stormwater runoff, new traffic emissions, and more, led Erie County Council to rescind approval of the necessary property transfer on August 29th. Less than two months after their initial vote, this unanimous decision effectively ended the business park proposal.</p>

<p>I applaud the concerned citizens of Girard and Fairview Townships for standing up against outdated land use decisions.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3><strong>Hold Erie Coke Accountable Calls for Transparency, Community Working Group</strong></h3>

<p><img alt="""" class=""align-left"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Untitled-design-%289%29.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 480px; float: left;"" />The work of Hold Erie Coke Accountable (HECA), another group of concerned residents, began in 2019 in response to persistent air and wastewater pollution violations by Erie Coke Corporation. Rather than bringing the plant into environmental compliance, as HECA advocated, Erie Coke chose to dodge responsibility and shutter the plant without alerting employees.</p>

<p>HECA&rsquo;s advocacy continues. HECA became increasingly concerned about the lack of effort by area leaders to ensure opportunities for community engagement regarding the future of the site. As a result, the group sent a letter outlining their concerns to almost 150 Erie regional stakeholders in mid-August.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of HECA&rsquo;s critical calls to action is the formation of a Community Working Group, mirroring the precedent set for Tonawanda Coke in Western NY. HECA continues to meet with stakeholders and leaders to advocate for the Community Working Group.</p>

<p>HECA remains committed to its principles for site reuse aimed at preventing another EPA Title V Air Permit holder from occupying the site. I appreciate HECA serving as a watchdog advocating for a future for the site, informed by the community and without another emission-belching, bad actor moving in.</p>

<p>A more equitable future for Erie that recognizes the importance of balanced economic prosperity and environmental stewardship will require lessons learned from near and far. This summer has shown that the list of local examples is growing rapidly, and we must build support for leaders who can connect the dots. Thank you again to the community advocates named above and others fighting for a better future for the PA Lake Erie Watershed and its residents.</p>

PennFuture’s Fall 2023 Legal Interns,9/21/2023,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognize that we need to be more involved with cultivating the people that will continue to support our mission. Our staff have a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting Pennsylvania as well as to further their potential environmental careers. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This fall, we have two fantastic students for our internship, including a returning intern, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We&rsquo;ve asked our interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""align-left"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Headshot--Lindsay-Williamson.png"" style=""width: 267px; height: 400px; float: left;"" />I completed an internship with PennFuture over the summer and felt the experience was so rewarding that I asked if I could stay through the fall semester.&nbsp; Luckily for me, Abby Jones, Vice President of Legal and Research at PennFuture, agreed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Connecticut.&nbsp; Despite not having a science background, I knew when I started law school at Widener Commonwealth University that I wanted to work in environmental law after graduation.&nbsp; I am the current president of Widener&rsquo;s Environmental Law and Policy Society.&nbsp; I have also taken several environmental law courses including international environmental law, land use planning, natural resources, environmental law, and animal law.&nbsp; While my time at Widener has provided foundational knowledge, interning at PennFuture has filled in the educational gaps by providing hands-on work experience on current environmental issues affecting Pennsylvania residents.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Working one-on-one with Rob Altenburg, PennFuture&rsquo;s Director of Energy and Climate, I was able to write a first draft of comments on the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s carbon rule for power plants.&nbsp; I have also reviewed briefs PennFuture is working on in partnership with other environmental advocacy organizations and researched guidance documents and model ordinances for utility-scale solar projects.&nbsp; In addition, I wrote blogs on the Supreme Court&rsquo;s recent Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency decision and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.&nbsp; I have gained insider knowledge on brief writing for Pennsylvania courts and attended meetings with PennFuture staff where creative solutions to combat environmental concerns such as climate change, pollution, and environmental injustice are brought to life.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture has encouraged me to continue my education during my internship by allowing me to take part in webinars and training programs.&nbsp; The legal team has been patient, encouraging, and has taken the time to ensure that I understand the projects they are working on and to explain different aspects of practicing environmental law.&nbsp; PennFuture staff are supportive of each other&rsquo;s work and have gone out of their way to make me feel like a valued team member.&nbsp; I have gained so much knowledge during my summer internship and am very grateful for this opportunity.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m excited to learn even more about environmental advocacy during my fall internship with PennFuture.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

After moving away and seeing that these sentiments did not permeate in other parts of the world, it became clear that work was needed to help integrate the ideas and policies that I had seen work so effectively in my own home into other places. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My interest in the law stems from my desire to effect real change into people&#39;s lives. The law affects every aspect of our lives, and for many, is often a source of much heartache and disillusion. To be able to use the law in an effective way that can support those who otherwise would be without a way to get justice in their lives is what is most important to me, and I hope to bring this ideal into practice. &nbsp;</p>

<p>At Dickinson Law, I am involved in the Student Bar Association, Dickinson Law Review, and the school&#39;s Diversity, Inclusion, and Educational Equity Committee. Diversity initiatives are very important to me, so to be able to play a meaningful role in my school&#39;s own initiatives is a real honor. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I am very excited to be at PennFuture this fall and learn more about environmental law and policy, as well as be involved in making a substantial contribution in the fight for the preservation of the environment in Pennsylvania. &nbsp;</p>

The State of Solar Development in PA: Solar Energy Benefits Remain Unrealized,8/10/2023,"<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Citizens/solar/Pages/default.aspx"">PA Department of Environmental Protection</a>, solar energy currently contributes less than 1 percent of the state&rsquo;s total electricity generation. Despite overall <a href=""https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/pennsylvania-solar"">increases across the state</a>, slow solar growth in PA does not align with the rapidly declining costs of installation, <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics"">available tax credits</a>, and myriad health benefits of prioritizing solar over fossil fuels. There are more reasons than ever to act quickly to secure Pennsylvanians&rsquo; economic, environmental, and social wellbeing, all of which would be augmented by increased deployment of solar energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To clarify why Pennsylvania decision-makers must take urgent action to invest in, expand access to, and amplify the co-benefits of solar energy, PennFuture recently released a <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Publication-White-Paper-Solar-Energy"">new report on solar energy</a>. This paper sets the record straight on commonly held myths about solar and recommendations to overcome the largest obstacles to solar energy adoption.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/White-Paper-Solar-Energy-%282%29.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<h3><span style=""color:#696969;"">Solar Myths &amp; Misconceptions</span></h3>

<p>Several&nbsp;myths and misconceptions have led to confusion and worry about the construction of both utility-scale and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Why-Go-Solar"">residential solar</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A few key points correcting common misinformation include the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pennsylvania receives ample sunshine to make solar generation effective.</li>
	<li>Solar arrays can <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/with-agrivoltaics-we-dont-have-choose-between-solar-power-producing-food-2023-03-20/"">coexist with working farms</a>, providing farmers with a sustainable source of income and the opportunity to maximize profit through agrivoltaics &mdash; the co-location of solar panels and agriculture. Unlike permanent housing developments, solar development and agricultural land use are not mutually exclusive.</li>
	<li>Well-designed modern solar systems are designed to mitigate concerns about erosion, groundwater contamination, and glare.</li>
	<li>The reuse, recycling and decommissioning of solar panels is feasible and sustainable. Many panels will continue to generate electricity long after a system is decommissioned and can be used in other applications. When it is time to retire the panels, <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/Solar%20Energy%20Supply%20Chain%20Report%20-%20Final.pdf"">90% of their&nbsp; components are recyclable</a> with current technology, which is continually improving.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the threats posed by solar myths, solar development in PA also faces more concrete legislative obstacles. Bills currently awaiting action in the PA legislature could further solidify the state&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels, prevent local efforts to incentivize solar, and burden solar development with greater bonding requirements than dirtier industries. Pennsylvania also lacks bills that strengthen solar access; to combat this issue, lawmakers should enable community solar and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Misguided-Homeowner-Association-Restrictions-Block-Pennsylvanias-Solar-Potential"">curtail HOA solar restrictions</a>.</p>

<h3><span style=""color:#696969;"">Moving&nbsp;Forward from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Legacy of Dirty Energy and Polluted Air</span></h3>

<p>Solar energy offers a key opportunity to <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-What-We-Learned-from-the-December-2022-Deep-Freeze-Dont-Rely-on-Natural-Gas-When-Its-Fracking-Cold-Part-1."">enhance the security of our energy grid</a>, create <a href=""https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/82213.pdf"">thousands of jobs</a>, improve <a href=""https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy07osti/41998.pdf"">air quality, and reduce health impacts</a> caused by fossil fuel emissions.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Policy Recommendations:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pennsylvania should increase its solar energy goals through higher Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) targets. The previous AEPS solar goal (0.5% of the 8% renewable energy goal) was attained in 2021, and a more ambitious target is needed. PennFuture supports <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&amp;SPick=20230&amp;cosponId=40010"">PA Senate Bill 230</a>, which would increase the renewable energy goal to 30% by 2030 and permit community solar.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania must encourage solar power development on brownfields and through use of agrivoltaics. The state has plenty of space for solar, especially since solar is a more preferable investment for farms than permanent-conversation developments. Additionally, the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation has found that there are more than <a href=""http://epcamr.org/storage/Abandoned_Mine_Land_Pgm_Fact_Sheet.pdf"">200,000 acres of abandoned mine land in PA</a>, which could potentially host solar farms.</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania needs to implement legislation supporting residential solar access, community solar, and more equitable bonding requirements. Rather than perpetuating the dominance of polluting fossil fuels, PA lawmakers must instead focus on pro-solar policies that will yield greater long-term advantages for their constituents.</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture continues its work promoting clean energy and a sustainable future for all Pennsylvanians. Solar energy is undoubtedly a crucial climate solution that is more affordable than ever. Continued solar restrictions, limited funding for renewable infrastructure, and subsidies for dirty energy are simply illogical and are doing a disservice to future generations.</p>

How Humans are Breaking the Jet Stream and Changing the Weather,7/19/2023,"<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-624a2864-7fff-bca5-ce8f-0b73f99ad4bd""></span></p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s weather in 2023 has been strange at best and deadly at worst. Extreme drought in May gave way to historically dangerous air quality in June, with a dash of severe storms and tornadoes for good measure. Forecasters point to wind patterns to describe why the weather has been so extreme. But a deeper dive into what&rsquo;s causing these unusual events points to something more insidious: humans are breaking the Earth&rsquo;s jet streams.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s back up and start with the basics before this becomes a sequel to Day After Tomorrow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong><span style=""color:#696969;"">What is a jet stream?&nbsp;</span></strong></h3>

<p><br />
Jet streams are like twelve-lane highways in the atmosphere. Fast-moving jets of air that circle the globe and are usually found at the height that commercial airlines fly. Jet streams exist because of temperature differences. The sun warms the Earth unevenly because our planet has an orbit and its axis is tilted, so regions around the equator get more solar warmth than regions around the poles. The temperature difference between the colder north and south poles with the equator causes the wind to blow in fast currents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These jet streams play a huge role in our daily lives. For example, Pennsylvania has faced numerous energy crises because of the polar vortex, where the northern polar jet dips down really far south, bringing with it arctic cold air.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-0783cf7b-7fff-e4d3-a7d7-7787389525c5""></span></p>

<p>This image above shows the jet streams on June 29, 2023. Notice the faster moving lines closer to the very top and bottom of the map. Also note that in the northern hemisphere, there is the so-called subtropical jet cutting across the United States and through the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</p>

<p>For months, forecasters talked about how the United States weather has been driven by what is called an <a href=""https://weather.com/forecast/national/news/2023-06-05-omega-block-weather-pattern-united-states-forecast-early-june"">Omega Block</a>, a pesky phenomenon where the jet stream stops moving predominantly west to east across the country and instead moves in big, blocky waves.</p>

<p>The second map zooms in on the United States during the same time period and highlights this wavy, omega-like jet stream pattern, which existed for all of May and into July. This blockiness locked in profound weather changes, including extreme heat in Texas, numerous tornado outbreaks across the plain states and deep south, as well as providing a pathway for wildfire smoke to travel from Canada to our airspace in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Omega Blocks are not uncommon, but what is unusual is how stuck and blocky the whole global jet stream pattern has become. Dr. Michael Mann, an esteemed climate scientist in Pennsylvania, <a href=""https://www.sciencealert.com/earths-jet-streams-look-as-chaotic-as-a-van-gogh-right-now-and-thats-a-big-problem"">noted that</a> he&rsquo;s &ldquo;...honestly at a loss to even characterize the current large-scale planetary wave pattern. Frankly it looks like a Van Gogh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Look more closely at the first map of global jet streams, and you may pick up what Dr. Mann sees&mdash;the subtropical jet in the northern hemisphere has become fragmented, discontinuous, and very slow compared to the jet streams elsewhere on the planet. For example, the jet stream lines over the US, India, China, and Northern Africa are colored light green (slower speed), and it&rsquo;s difficult to connect a continuous line across the globe. It&rsquo;s subtle but important.</p>

<strong><span style=""color:#696969;"">Why does this matter, and what&rsquo;s causing it?</span></strong></h3>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Climate change research <a href=""https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2018/10/climate-change-and-extreme-summer-weather-events-the-future-is-still-in-our-hands/"">gives us a good clue</a> about what is going on. Man-made global warming is rapidly heating the planet and much of that heat is being recorded as big temperature spikes at the poles. For instance, the North Atlantic is <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/20/europe/marine-heatwave-north-atlantic-climate-scn-intl/index.html"">in the midst</a> of a never before seen increase in ocean temperatures of 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Arctic Sea ice has plummeted so much recently that scientists expect it to be <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/world/arctic-sea-ice-free-climate-change/index.html"">ice-free</a> in the summer by the end of this decade. And <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/13/climate/global-warming-heat-june.html"">global average temperatures</a> in June are currently running close to a degree warmer than any month in recorded history.</p>

<p>Rapid warming in the Arctic fundamentally changes the temperature difference between the poles and the equator. Without a steep temperature difference, wind currents slow. <strong>In other words, global warming&mdash;and thus human activity&mdash;slows, and even breaks the global jet streams.</strong> As the jet stream slows, the blocky wave patterns like the Omega Block, get bigger and tend to get stuck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sound familiar to what we&rsquo;ve been experiencing for over two months in Pennsylvania?&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the short-term, extreme weather is only going to get worse. Natural cycles in global climate patterns are also changing. They will enhance the human-induced changes we just discussed, including a rapid warming of the east Pacific Ocean called an El Nino pattern that also causes significant changes to the jet stream and US weather patterns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Humans burning fossil fuels and warming the planet are having far-reaching impacts, going so far as to now change the fundamental dynamics of the planet&#39;s jet streams and adding to the long and growing list of extreme weather harming the Commonwealth. The question has long been: can and should we do anything about global warming in Pennsylvania? Yet, as we more deeply change the climate, the question shifts&nbsp; to how fast can we do everything to stop this madness?</p>

Zoning ordinances are the most powerful tool municipalities have to control how land is used and to ensure that community growth is orderly and reasonable and does not outpace a community&rsquo;s ability to provide adequate water, sewer, school, recreational, and public safety services and employment opportunities. Zoning is also a way for municipalities to preserve valuable natural resources such as forests, waterways, wetlands, aquifers, and floodplains by directing development away from these areas and/or imposing restrictions on development that may impact these resources. Zoning also provides a predictable regulatory environment for developers and the public.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

The Model Ordinance provides updated definitions for logistics uses and divides them into three categories based on their size and ability to generate traffic. It also imposes restrictions based on these characteristics. For example, under the Model Ordinance, logistics facilities that generate significant truck traffic must be located within a half-mile of an expressway, install signage to direct truck drivers away from local roads, and provide overnight truck parking and amenities for drivers. Large facilities (over 25,000 sq. ft.) must have buffer yards to separate them from neighboring properties and must plant trees and shrubs to lessen their visual and noise impact.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

All facilities are also eligible for impervious pavement credits to mitigate the negative impact of the vast impervious surfaces they generate. Finally, PennFuture recommends that all but the smallest, least impactful logistics facilities be designated as conditional uses or special exception uses, regardless of which zoning district they are in. This provides municipalities and the public the opportunity to review and comment on proposed facilities during a public hearing to determine whether they are appropriate for the proposed location.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

The Model Ordinance draws on our participation in several local land use hearings and appeals, research into how the e-commerce logistics industry works, and review of existing and proposed zoning ordinances that attempt to address the growing and changing logistics industry in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Along with the accompanying guidebook, which provides additional guidance for adopting the Model Ordinance and tailoring it to the needs of each individual community, as well as factual support for the proposed provisions, the Model Ordinance provides an excellent starting point for municipalities across Pennsylvania as they bring their zoning ordinances into the twenty-first century.</span></span></h3>

The project requires the clearing and regrading of approximately 500 acres of woodlands, which drain into Exceptional Value Swiftwater Creek and High Quality streams Dry Sawmill Run and Scot Run. In August 2022, PennFuture and BWA filed a lawsuit against DEP and developer Swiftwater Solar, because the permits issued did not ensure that the water quality of these special protection waters would be protected from the degrading impacts of the project. The settlement resolves these issues and closes out the case.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

As a result, the solar field is a permissible use for this property and would be built. However, a permissible use is not a blank check to develop without any regard for the surroundings. PennFuture, BWA, Swiftwater Solar, and DEP worked together to reach a plan that would balance the water quality protections with the solar development itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

A key principle is to have soil that is not compacted, but is soft, with lots of space between the bits of dirt in the ground (the technical term is &ldquo;pore space&rdquo;). Think of it like a loaf of bread: wonderbread is even and smooth, while an English muffin has those nooks and crannies. In uncompacted soils, when it rains or when snow melts, the water has lots of places to go and filters into the ground before eventually making its way into a nearby stream, pond, or other waterbody. When soil gets really compacted, water just runs straight off the surface, bringing sediment and other pollutants along that can harm pristine waters like Swiftwater Creek. To maintain the hydrological condition, we needed the site to maintain (where possible) and restore (where necessary) that soft nooks-and-crannies type of soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

First, the trees, shrubs, and groundcover all help physically slow down the rainwater as it reaches the ground. Then, the root systems of all these plants, which can run very deep, help to keep the soil in a relatively &ldquo;fluffy&rdquo; state, with the &ldquo;nooks and crannies&rdquo; mentioned above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

A true meadow, one seeded with native plants that vary in height and have high resiliency, can also be a great filter for stormwater in the same ways that forests are. Now, the term &ldquo;meadow&rdquo; can be tricky because it is a word that has both a technical use but is also is often used casually in a number of different ways. A farmer might think of a hay pasture meadow, seeded with grasses for yield and nutrition. A biologist might think of a grassland meadow where plants are allowed to flower, grow, and self-seed without grazing. And most average people might simply think of a lush field of grass and maybe flowers, without worrying about what kind of grasses or flowers they are. But the composition is important to the performance, and the plants that grow above ground also affect what is happening below ground, and what happens when it rains and storms. Consider the average lawn: a uniform, non-native grass that is kept at a consistent short height does not do a great job of creating space for water to infiltrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

First, they will use low-impact construction equipment wherever possible and work to minimize the amount of compaction of soil. Second, the site will have multiple levels of decompaction, to ensure that the soil is restored to a fluffy state that allows infiltration across the whole area. Swiftwater and DEP agreed to testing protocols, to ensure that there are some simple metrics for accountability. Swiftwater Solar will also use specialized seed mixes that balance the need to use the right plant species for the area with the height requirements of the solar panels themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

This means that the seeds for the final planting are chosen with the long-term use in mind, whether it is the wetland-like conditions at the bottom of the basins, or the dryer, steeper sides of the basins. The basins will be planted with willows, which will improve infiltration and discourage invasive plants.

<p><span><span>Like any law, zoning ordinances should be updated to reflect changes in society. One of the most significant changes impacting land use in Pennsylvania today is the rise of e-commerce and the massive logistics facilities that support it. As online shopping has become a major source of retail goods, industry practices have changed, and land development patterns have changed along with them. No longer the long-term-storage-based &ldquo;warehouse&rdquo; uses of the past, 21st century logistics facilities like distribution centers, fulfillment centers, and truck terminals are substantially larger, with an emphasis on rapid turnover of massive quantities of goods and materials.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Case Study &ndash; Jackson Township, Monroe County</span></span></p>

<div><span><span></span></span></div>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><span></span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Updated Definitions</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span></span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Jackson Township has taken steps to update its zoning ordinance to address logistics uses. Its proposed ordinance, to be considered for approval at a public meeting on June 7, 2023, builds on lessons learned in Coolbaugh Township.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>To begin, Jackson Township&rsquo;s proposed ordinance includes clearer definitions of Warehouse and Distribution Center/Logistics Center. Where the existing ordinance defines a warehouse as &ldquo;a building or group of buildings primarily used for the indoor storage, transfer and distribution of products and materials,&rdquo; the proposed ordinance clarifies that a warehouse shall only consist of indoor storage of products and materials and cannot include &ldquo;value-added&rdquo; activities typical of distribution and fulfillment centers such as breaking down large orders into smaller orders, packaging, and order fulfillment. With this new definition, the proposed ordinance makes clear that any facility that goes beyond mere storage is not a warehouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span><span>In addition, where the existing ordinance treats all warehouses the same, regardless of size, the proposed ordinance recognizes that today&rsquo;s warehouses are no longer exclusively small- to medium-sized facilities that can blend easily into a typical industrial or commercial area.&nbsp; Therefore, the proposed ordinance divides warehouses into two categories: Small Warehouses (up to 25,000 sq. ft.) and Large Warehouses (25,000 sq. ft. and above). Large Warehouses are subject to greater restrictions than Small Warehouses.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Dead_Wholesale_store_in_Pittsburgh-_Pennsylvania_(9311821912).jpg"" target=""_parent""><img alt="""" class=""align-left"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Dead_Wholesale_store_in_Pittsburgh-_Pennsylvania_%289311821912%29.jpg"" style=""width: 450px; height: 380px; float: left;"" /></a><img alt=""Walmart Distribution Center in Tomah, Wisconsin"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Walmart_distribution_center_in_Tomah-_Wisconsin_9_pano.jpg"" style=""width: 580px; height: 320px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Jackson Township&rsquo;s proposed ordinance also updates the definition of Distribution Center/Truck Terminal by strengthening the distinction between Distribution Centers/Truck Terminals and Warehouses. The proposed definition makes clear that value-added services, which are explicitly excluded from the definition of Warehouse, are one of the defining characteristics of a Distribution Center/Truck Terminal. The proposed ordinance also eliminates potentially-confusing language in the existing ordinance that allows a Warehouse to be &ldquo;part of the operation&rdquo; of a Distribution Center/Truck Terminal. In the proposed ordinance, these two uses are clearly distinct from one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><br />
<span><span>Most significantly, the proposed ordinance treats any Large Warehouse that will generate more than 50 tractor-trailer trips in any 24-hour period as a Distribution Center/Truck Terminal. This is especially important because third-party developers often construct logistics facilities on speculation or &ldquo;on spec.&rdquo; This means the developer does not know who will occupy the facility when it is completed</span><span><span style=""font-size:0.6em;vertical-align:super;"">1. </span></span><span>Developers can take advantage of this uncertainty by simply declaring that their facility is a storage-only Warehouse, not a Distribution Center/Truck Terminal offering value-added services. Without knowing who will ultimately occupy the building, municipalities and residents are forced to take developers at their word. Jackson Township&rsquo;s 50-vehicle-trip trigger closes this loophole by linking regulation of the facility to an objective measurement that a developer must provide when applying for zoning approval.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Large Warehouses and Distribution Centers to Require Conditional Use Approval</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: left;""><span></span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Jackson Township&rsquo;s new, more precise definitions allow the Township to craft additional zoning restrictions suited to the different types of uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>For example, under the existing ordinance, Warehouses of any size are permitted as of right in the Township&rsquo;s I-Industrial district. This means that any facility that meets the definition of a warehouse and complies with building size and setbacks requirements, even a 1 million square foot facility, could be built anywhere in the I-Industrial district without review or approval by the Board of Supervisors or public input as to whether the use is appropriate in that location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>The proposed ordinance changes this. Both Large and Small Warehouses are still limited to the I-Industrial district, but only Small Warehouses can be built without additional zoning review. Under the proposed ordinance, Large Warehouses are conditional uses, meaning that the Township Supervisors must review each proposed Large Warehouse to make sure it satisfies the specific requirements in the zoning ordinance. The Board of Supervisors must hold a public hearing and allow the public to weigh in on the proposal. This process also gives the Board of Supervisors an opportunity to impose conditions on approval, which is not possible with uses permitted by right.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>The proposed ordinance also adds new, specific requirements that Large Warehouses must meet to obtain zoning approval from the Board of Supervisors. These requirements are related to the impacts generated by these massive facilities and include:&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p>

<ul dir=""ltr"">
	<li><span><span>A description of the nature and scale of on-site activities;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>A detailed description of potential environmental impacts;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Evidence that the number of truck parking spaces will be adequate to accommodate expected demand; and&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>A traffic study.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Under both the existing ordinance and the proposed ordinance, Distribution Centers/Truck Terminals are conditional uses in the I-Industrial district and are subject to the same review process. However, the proposed ordinance enhances the Township&rsquo;s power to control Distribution Center/Truck Terminal by adding new requirements a developer must satisfy to obtain approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Under the existing ordinance, the only requirements for zoning approval of a Distribution Center/Truck Terminal are a 5-acre minimum lot size, a 100-foot setback from residential areas and a 50-foot setback from commercial areas. The proposed ordinance adds new requirements aimed at mitigating the impacts of these facilities, particularly traffic impacts.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>These include:&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p>

<ul dir=""ltr"">
	<li><span><span>A 10-acre minimum lot size;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>A 150-foot setback between the facility and residential property lines;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>On-site stacking area for tractor-trailers;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Prohibition against parking, loading and unloading on any public road;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Amenities for the comfort, convenience and safety of truck drivers;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>A traffic study; and&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>An environmental impact assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>PennFuture is pleased to see Jackson Township taking these steps toward a more comprehensive and effective ordinance that will enhance the Township&rsquo;s ability to regulate logistics uses, and we support their amendment.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Although Jackson Township&rsquo;s proposed ordinance is a substantial improvement over its existing ordinance, there is some room to improve the ordinance to provide greater protection for special protection waters.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

In 2008, the National Research Council and the Environmental Protection Agency released a report identifying unmanaged stormwater from rain or snow events as a significant source of water pollution. As precipitation runs down rooftops and over dirty streets and sidewalks, the stormwater collects pollutants such as oil, fertilizer, litter, and pet waste. Stormwater runoff carries pollutants into nearby rivers, streams, and lakes.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Municipalities will charge property owners a stormwater fee proportionate to the amount of impervious cover (ex., concrete) their property contains.

Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. City of Roanoke, 916 F.3d 315 (4th Cir. 2019). The City of Roanoke enacted a stormwater fee to fund its stormwater management system, similar to West Chester&#39;s program. Roanoke assessed a stormwater charge for Norfolk Southern Railway, but Norfolk Southern refused to pay and sued the city, alleging that the charge was a discriminatory tax against railways. The Fourth Circuit applied a multi-factor analysis to determine whether the charge was a tax or a fee. Unlike the Commonwealth Court, the Fourth Circuit found that the properties charged did receive a discrete benefit from the funded stormwater system by controlling and treating polluted stormwater contributed by developed properties.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

"Environmental Disaster from East Palestine, OH Train Derailment",2/23/2023,"<p>The East Palestine, Ohio train derailment disaster is shocking in its scale and potential effects. Unfortunately, we may not know this disaster&#39;s long-term health and environmental impacts for months or even years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gradual release and burn of these chemicals increased the risk that they spread beyond the crash site. With butyl acrylate found in local surface water, testing the groundwater supply and subsoil is crucial. We encourage anyone concerned about pollution and the safety of their community to document their observations and request soil and well water testing from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The residents of East Palestine and neighboring communities deserve transparency around the EPA&#39;s plan for continued air quality monitoring and the data of air tests.</p>

<p>Regardless of location and as a regular practice, residents should report any unusual odor or changes in environmental conditions to the appropriate state environmental agency. We encourage residents to do their best to document the changes they&#39;ve observed so environmental threats can be tracked and mitigated.</p>

<p>PennFuture continues to closely track developments and information coming from both locals and government agencies.</p>

<h3 style=""color:#aaa;font-style:italic;""><strong>What We Know of the Accident</strong></h3>

<p>On Friday, February 3, at 8:54 p.m. ET, a Norfolk Southern freight train heading to Conway, Pennsylvania, derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, approximately 1.2 miles from the Pennsylvania state line. Thirty-eight rail cars went off the tracks and caught fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20230214.aspx"">According to the National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB)</a>, the investigating agency, a resident&#39;s home surveillance video showed what appears to be a wheel bearing in the final stage of overheating failure moments before the derailment.</p>

<p>The fear of a possible explosion forced the evacuation of 1,500 to 2,000 residents in a town of only 4,900.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style=""color:#aaa;font-style:italic;""><strong>An Explanation of the Environmental Disaster</strong></h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Images/Smoke_from_the_fire_on_the_night_of_the_accident_%28v0wn4mB%29.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 301px;"" /></p>

<p>The train towed 20 cars with hazardous material&mdash;11 of which derailed. Five overturned cars contained vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make PVC plastic and vinyl products. According to the National Cancer Institute, it is a flammable gas and cancer-causing.</p>

<p>Norfolk Southern said some cars carrying vinyl chloride were at risk of exploding. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine authorized a controlled burn of the chemicals on Monday, February 6. This burn resulted in a massive smoke plume.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Vinyl Chloride</strong></p>

<p>When burned, vinyl chloride breaks down into two chemicals: hydrogen chloride and phosgene. Phosgene is highly poisonous&mdash;used in chemical warfare during World War I and responsible for many deaths, <a href=""https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/phosgene/basics/facts.asp"">according to the CDC</a>. While long-term exposure to higher concentrations of the gas can be deadly, the gas released by Norfolk did not result in reports of injuries or fatalities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hydrogen chloride can cause eye, skin, and respiratory irritation and pain.</p>

<p><strong>Other Chemicals Onboard</strong></p>

<p>In addition to vinyl chloride, the EPA listed the following chemicals as also on the train:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Butyl acrylate &mdash; a liquid used for making paint, adhesives, and sealants</li>
	<li>Ethylhexyl acrylate &mdash; a liquid used for making paint, printing inks, and plastics, is toxic to the lungs and nervous system</li>
	<li>Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether &mdash; an industrial solvent that can be absorbed through the skin and is toxic to the liver and kidneys</li>
	<li>Isobutylene &mdash; &#8203;&#8203;a gas used in antioxidants, packaging, plastics, and high-octane plane fuel</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s currently known that the derailment caused the release of butyl acrylate and ethylhexyl acrylate, which leaked into the ground, nearby streams, and storm drains.</p>

<p>Another major cause for alarm is the areas of contaminated soil and free liquids that, according to the EPA, <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-02/Norfolk%20Southern%20East%20Palestine%20Train%20Derailment%20General%20Notice%20Letter%202.10.2023%20%281%29.pdf"">&quot;were observed and potentially covered and/or filled during reconstruction of the rail line including portions of the trench /burn pit that was used for the open burn off of vinyl chloride.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Having multiple chemicals released adds to the complexity of the situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tuesday, February 21, EPA&nbsp;Administrator Michael Regan ordered Norfolk Southern Railway to pay for the contaminated soil and water cleanup and reimburse the EPA for the private cleanup of residential homes and businesses. This order enables the EPA to force Norfolk Southern to adhere to a plan set and managed by the EPA.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style=""color:#aaa;font-style:italic;""><strong>Health Impacts</strong></h3>

<p>The EPA monitored the air quality and tested East Palestine&#39;s municipal drinking water well. Private well water testing is ongoing and residents with wells are told to still use bottled water. The EPA did not yet release the data from air monitor testing.</p>

<p><strong>Drinking Water</strong></p>

<p>Ohio Gov. DeWine said on Wednesday, February 16, that the water in East Palestine&#39;s municipal system is <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2023/02/15/ohio-train-derailment-water-safe"">safe to drink</a> based on the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s results, however:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Ohio EPA recommends people using private wells for drinking water schedule an appointment for well water testing.</li>
	<li>The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will conduct independent water sampling to monitor water contamination risks related to the train derailment closely.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Air Monitoring</strong></p>

<p>Air quality monitors are a tool to measure exposure to air contaminants, but the technology has limitations. While the EPA has come out to say the air quality in and around East Palestine is safe for residents to return home, officials have not provided any data from the air tests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on which types of air monitors the EPA is utilizing, they may not be providing the exact chemical breakdown and measurements in the air.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How a healthy first responder reacts to a particular air quality measurement differs from an older adult or a child.</p>

<p>The EPA needs to be transparent with community members on the technology used to test air quality, the limitations of the equipment, the chemical specificity found, and the measurements.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style=""color:#aaa;font-style:italic;""><strong>Environmental Impacts</strong></h3>

<p>The Norfolk Southern train carried 20 cars with hazardous materials. After the spill, chemicals&mdash;including an entire load of butyl acrylates&mdash;were seen running into storm drains and water sources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of Tuesday, February 21&mdash;two weeks after the train derailment&mdash;Norfolk Southern reported the chemical spill contaminated at least 15,000 pounds of soil and 1.1 million gallons of water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Locals documented images of dead fish and an oily sheen along Ohio River tributaries days after the spill. Those streams are reintroduction sites for the hellbender salamander.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Water pollution puts endangered amphibian species at risk. An official with the<a href=""https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/east-palestine-train-derailment/officials-speak-on-dead-fish-following-train-derailment/""> Ohio Department of Natural Resources told WKBN</a> that it would take time to know the effects on the hellbender.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The federal government&#39;s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry opened an investigation tracking the chemical exposure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Water Contamination</strong></p>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://epa.ohio.gov/monitor-pollution/pollution-issues/east-palestine"">Ohio EPA</a>, the Sulphur Run stream was the body of water most impacted by the derailment because of an &quot;impoundment&quot; on February 8 when officials rerouted the water with the damming and pumps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Environmental teams dammed a portion of Sulphur Run and rerouted it to protect water downstream. Teams will treat contaminated water with booms, aeration, and carbon filtration units.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Are Dioxins?</strong></p>

<p>Dioxins are highly toxic, persistent organic pollutants that take a long time to break down once in the environment. They are a contaminant formed during the production of some chlorinated organic compounds, released through waste incineration or burning fuels. Dioxins can travel long distances in the air or water; when they settle into the soil, it will take several years to break down.</p>

<p>Once in the environment, they can accumulate in the food chain&mdash;primarily in animal fat, fish, and shellfish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dioxins can cause cancer, disrupt hormones, lead to reproductive and developmental problems, and damage the immune system. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6221983/"" target=""_blank"">In July 1976, a chemical plant explosion near Seveso, Italy exposed locals to the highest known levels of dioxin.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Ohio&#39;s senators Sherrod Brown (D) and J.D. Vance (R) sent a <a href=""https://www.brown.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_epa_about_dioxins_and_east_palestine_final.pdf"">joint letter </a>requesting the state and federal EPAs to test the air for dioxins.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, February 21, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said his office made a criminal referral against Norfolk Southern to the acting Pennsylvania attorney general for review. At a press conference with Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, Shapiro said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;The combination of Norfolk Southern&#39;s corporate greed, incompetence, and lack of care for our residents is absolutely unacceptable.&quot;</p>

<p>Shapiro previously said publicly and in a letter to Norfolk Southern&#39;s CEO:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;You can be assured that Pennsylvania will hold Norfolk Southern accountable for any and all impacts to our Commonwealth.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2023.2.14-Norfolk-Southern-Letter.pdf"">Shapiro listed three critical things Norfolk Southern did wrong after the derailment</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Norfolk Southern made its own plan and did not implement a unified command which confused first responders and emergency management. As a result, state and local agencies had to react versus work in tandem.</li>
	<li>Norfolk Southern gave inaccurate information and conflicting modeling about the impact of the controlled release of chemicals.</li>
	<li>Norfolk Southern was unwilling to explore an alternative to burning chemicals and released and burned the chemicals without warning government agencies.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Pennsylvania&#39;s senators Bob Casey (D) and John Fetterman (D) <a href=""https://www.casey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_epa_about_ns_derailment.pdf"">sent a joint letter with the Ohio senators</a> requesting the EPA continue its monitoring of the land, air, and water in East Palestine, Darlington Township in Beaver County, and other impacted communities &quot;until the long-term effects of the exposure are fully understood.&quot;</p>

<h3 style=""color:#aaa;font-style:italic;""><strong>Questions and Actions Post-Emergency Operations</strong></h3>

<p>PennFuture believes environmental disasters are long-term public health disasters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We should ask the following questions of Norfolk Southern Railway Company and Pennsylvania and Ohio leaders:</p>

<ol>
	<li>What is the current plan for continued community engagement? How frequently will residents in East Palestine and the surrounding areas receive updates? Are there opportunities to comment on cleanup plans?</li>
	<li>How is ambient air being monitored? What are those measurements?</li>
	<li>Where are air samples being collected?</li>
	<li>How frequently is the air quality being tested?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Do experts know how far the toxic plume traveled?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Which bodies of water are scientists sampling, and for which chemical constituents?</li>
	<li>Are officials advising children and dogs not to play in streams?</li>
	<li>Were surface wipes used on residents&#39; homes and vehicles? If so, what were the results?</li>
	<li>Where are soil samples being collected, and how deep are those samples?</li>
	<li>What is the plan for dioxin testing?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>What is the plan to notify the community of dioxin contamination?</li>
	<li>Was the controlled release and burn the best way to control the chemicals?</li>
	<li>What are the reasoning and safety around transporting various chemicals near one another?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Was the train adequately inspected? Are there plans to improve the inspections in the future?</li>
	<li>How can the community engage with testing and ongoing monitoring?</li>
	<li>Are we investing enough in environmental agencies&#39; personnel and equipment to ensure the fastest and best response to the next disaster?</li>

Misguided Homeowner Association Restrictions Block Pennsylvania’s Solar Potential,2/5/2023,"<p><strong>By Caroline Weiss, Legal Intern</strong></p>

<p>Lately, homeowners are coming across unlikely opponents to their solar ambitions. In states without solar access legislation, new restrictions are being implemented by homeowners associations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; reasons, HOAs all too often prohibit installation of solar panels on homeowners&rsquo; rooftops. Even when they lack solar bylaws, HOAs can be reluctant to have conversations with their members about the possibility of solar in their neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Restrictions can sometimes be quite unfair or illogical: solar panels may only be allowed on the side of the roof that is not visible from the street&mdash; thus often disregarding the fact that solar panels are more effective on south-facing roofs. Preventing homeowners from installing solar on their own properties also limits potential benefits such as higher property values, lower electricity costs, and non-polluting renewable energy. In fact, homes with installed solar can, on average, sell for 4 percent more than properties without solar systems, according to&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.zillow.com/research/solar-panels-house-sell-more-23798/"">Zillow</a>. These reasons are why many are calling for changes to solar-restricting practices.</p>

<p>Ohio recently addressed these concerns with legislation that grants extra protections for individuals who install solar panels on their own property. Ohio&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/134/sb61"">Senate Bill 61</a>, passed June 14, 2022 and in effect since September 13, 2022, specifically applies to homeowners in condominiums and planned communities, who are subject to HOA regulations. Under this&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.dickinson-wright.com/news-alerts/-ohio-legislature-adopts-new-protections-for-solar-access"">bipartisan bill</a>, homeowners are permitted to install solar panels unless explicitly prohibited by the HOA declaration, as long as one of the<a href=""https://search-prod.lis.state.oh.us/solarapi/v1/general_assembly_134/bills/sb61/EN/05/sb61_05_EN?format=pdf"">&nbsp;following conditions&nbsp;</a>apply:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The condominium unit includes the roof (as defined in the declaration), thus the owner is responsible for costs related to the roof, or&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The declaration expressly permits solar panels and &ldquo;establishes responsibility for the cost to insure, maintain, repair, and replace such devices.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>HOAs can still retain the ability to establish &ldquo;reasonable restrictions&rdquo; on solar panel size and placement, which may differ for each community. While this law clearly does not grant full rights to homeowners to install solar as desired without restrictions, SB 61 is&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.natlawreview.com/article/ohio-sb-61-adds-protections-solar-panels-condominium-and-planned-community-homes"">a&nbsp;positive change</a>&nbsp;from prior Ohio law, which allowed HOAs to prohibit solar entirely.</p>

<p>Ohio State Senator Nickie Antonio&nbsp;<a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__solarunitedneighbors-2Dorg.zoom.us_rec_share_yf-2DAUSILu4EmeDDd5lJfWsN9sj0CICLX6qbxzX7wLzTADRHyoclFNEEVpP5qyPck.LDX3PC6c9qQjYBqM-3FstartTime-3D1674486151000&amp;d=DwMFAw&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=FWlGgRActI0u6Isyl7Nzu50dSmcEuzpnuGVzmbjyYL8&amp;m=_7uswVlUwfgRz-9zt_BLnYhjoKptxIFy8u5_pir7Dhs&amp;s=QV2NHQ85b3S0wsQ5zbGNplUBtE6pIBW9IkEDettPBbQ&amp;e="">spoke last month</a>&nbsp;about her reasons for supporting SB 61. Sen. Antonio had seen firsthand the benefits of solar in her own neighborhood and had heard stories from frustrated homeowners who were subjected to solar restrictions. Leader Antonio said that the bill&rsquo;s success in Ohio was derived from luck, timing, and relationships, as well as the time in which it was considered: over the course of two general assemblies, there was ample time to educate members to garner support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This type of education is especially important as we see more and more anti-solar sentiment being promoted, sometimes perpetuated by the oil and gas industry.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.paenvironmentdigest.com/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=52705&amp;SubjectID="">misconceptions of solar</a>&nbsp;have been expressed by Pennsylvania leadership, resulting in stalled pro-solar legislation and the introduction of anti-solar bills&mdash;such as Senate Bills&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=275"">275</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=284"">284</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=792"">792</a>. Each piece of legislation is a clear attempt to manufacture concerns to raise fear, uncertainty, and doubt about solar. In Pennsylvania, local cities, townships and boroughs have the ability to regulate solar through&nbsp;<a href=""https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/research/publications/regulating-utility-scale-solar-projects-on-agricultural-land/"">municipal zoning ordinances</a>.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.farmanddairy.com/news/majority-of-local-zoning-codes-in-pa-lack-guidance-on-solar/666604.html"">A Penn State Dickinson Law review</a>&nbsp;of 2,500 local ordinances revealed, however, that only 13 percent of municipalities addressed solar of any kind in these codes. Some municipal ordinances make it harder for solar to be sited than, say, a gas-fired power plant.</p>

<p>Lack of solar access is a problem in Pennsylvania as well. Tony Ranieri, founder and president of Ohio solar installation company&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.solarisfreedom.com/"">Solar is Freedom</a>, also spoke to the benefits of solar for the energy economy in his state. Ranieri said that his business and that of other solar installers increases substantially with solar access legislation. As more homeowners are granted the opportunity to go solar, their choice to do so reduces grid pressure and overall cost per kilowatt-hour of energy.</p>

<p>Ohio&#39;s neighboring success highlights Pennsylvania&rsquo;s lack of solar access legislation.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&amp;SPick=20210&amp;cosponId=35408"">Senate Bill 826</a>, introduced by Senator Katie Muth in July 2021, would ensure that HOAs permit solar panel installations. This bill is still awaiting a vote, unfortunately. With every session that our legislators fail to take action to protect homeowners&rsquo; property rights, our state falls even further behind on advancing home rooftop solar&rsquo;s potential. HOAs&rsquo; solar restrictions should be curtailed all across the Commonwealth. Doing so would advance equity in property rights and allow homeowners the ability to enjoy greater environmental and economic benefits.</p>

Introducing PennFuture’s New Legal & Policy Interns!,1/30/2023,"<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-645d8449-7fff-fb39-19c3-30766dccae8c""></span></p>

<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment and our communities. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognize that we need to be more involved with cultivating the people that will continue to support our mission. Our staff have a long history of mentoring interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal and policy internship program to inspire and mentor students interested in making a difference for our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal and policy minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting Pennsylvania as well as to further their potential environmental careers. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.</p>

<p>This spring, we have two fantastic students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We&rsquo;ve asked our new interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</p>

<p><strong>Lisa Dang, Third Year Student at Penn State Dickinson Law</strong></p>

<p>I have always had a penchant for environmental issues. During my undergraduate studies at William and Mary, I participated in a semester-long study abroad program in Cambodia and Vietnam, exploring environmental and climate change impacts on local communities located along the Mekong River. Immediately after undergrad, I worked at Environment Virginia, coordinating and implementing grassroots activities to advocate for environmental justice and renewable energy. Additionally, I interned at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project (PULP), serving at-risk communities affected by utility and energy-related matters.</p>

<p>As a 3L at Penn State Dickinson Law, I have continued to pursue environmental policy and law classes, further driving my passion and commitment to help foster a more sustainable future. I spent significant time researching the feasibility of deploying solar technology in K-12 public school systems in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>I am thrilled to be a part of the PennFuture team, working with passionate, diverse environmental law attorneys to tackle a wide range of environmental issues. I relish the opportunity to learn and help protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s right to clean air, water, and environment.</p>

<p>Beyond work and school, I enjoy playing competitive ultimate frisbee. Currently, I play for DC Shadow and Scandal based in Washington, DC.</p>

<p><strong>Caroline Weiss, graduate student at the University of Iceland in Environment and Natural Resources, with a specialization in environmental policy</strong></p>

<p>I am currently pursuing my Master&rsquo;s in Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Iceland, where I am specializing in environmental policy and management. Beginning my undergraduate study at the University of Pittsburgh, I had never envisioned myself double majoring in Environmental Studies and Political Science. Yet my introductory Environmental Science course, sustainability-focused extracurriculars, and childhood influence converged as I recognized my passion for environmental issues. I had grown up hiking most weekends, learning the importance of recycling and conserving at home, and volunteering at Heritage Creek Farm Camp, which ignited my appreciation for the natural world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Throughout my studies, I have been drawn to the social sciences and policy as tools to drive environmental change. From my participation in Pitt&rsquo;s environmental honors fraternity, internships at the Sierra Club and Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, and study abroad experience in Iceland, I gained an even deeper understanding of the value of policy and education to advance environmental solutions. I am eager to learn from PennFuture&rsquo;s talented team of environmental advocates this spring, especially regarding renewable energy policy issues in our state.</p>

<hr />
<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s legal and policy team is dedicated to restoring and protecting our environment and communities, to protecting our right to clean air and pure water, and to moving Pennsylvania toward a clean energy future. I thank our amazing staff and interns for their great work, and also our members for your continued support. We can&rsquo;t do this without you!&nbsp;</p>

What We Learned from the December 2022 Deep Freeze: Don’t Rely on Natural Gas When It’s Fracking Cold (Part 2),1/27/2023,"<p><b><i>In our previous article, we explained how Pennsylvania&rsquo;s energy grid became perilously close to a brownout event during last month&rsquo;s winter storm. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-What-We-Learned-from-the-December-2022-Deep-Freeze-Dont-Rely-on-Natural-Gas-When-Its-Fracking-Cold-Part-1"">Read part one for a day-by-day breakdown of the chain of events.</a></i></b></p>

<p>In December, fracked gas and coal plants across the Pennsylvania energy grid failed at rates of significantly higher than the grid operator had anticipated.</p>

<p>While PJM collects more detailed information on the cause of the 2022 holiday weekend outages, their preliminary data aggregates the causes into a few categories. Most of the outages are reported to have been caused by failed plant equipment, low fuel supply, or start failure and unit trips. Outages in the last category are often a consequence of equipment or fuel issues.</p>

<p>Fuel supply for gas plants is an <a href=""http://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC_SPOD_11142017_Final.pdf"">on-going concern</a>. An operator must not only purchase sufficient fuel, but they must also have sufficient pipeline capacity for that fuel to be delivered when and where it is needed.</p>

<p>Gas generators can arrange for sales and delivery with either &ldquo;firm&rdquo; contracts (where the customer is a high priority) or cheaper &ldquo;interruptible&rdquo; contracts, where an order can be canceled if someone else is willing to pay more. Preliminary data shows that more than 17 percent of the gas in Pennsylvania <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/"">was acquired</a> through interruptible contracts, meaning many gas power plants would lose their supply when other consumers needed it most.</p>

<p>Even firm contracts don&rsquo;t insure delivery. Unexpected conditions&mdash;like severe winter storms&mdash;can result in local gas utilities and gas-fired generation competing for the same supply and pipeline capacity. In those situations, the local utilities normally take priority. That&rsquo;s because, if they lose gas, millions of households will have no other option for heat, not to mention the danger of re-lighting massive numbers of pilot lights. As a result, gas-fired power plants with firm contracts can have the tap turned off. It looks like this may have happened as well.</p>

<p><i>Fracked Gas is Rightfully Nervous and is Looking to Cast Blame Elsewhere<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p>High on the list of industry talking points is the tired claim that environmental protections get in the way of their operations, and, with less oversight and fewer regulations, they could do better&mdash;we just need to trust them. Unfortunately for them, there is no evidence this is true.</p>

<p>Preliminary reports show that only a very small percentage of facilities reached their emissions limits and had to shut down That isn&rsquo;t surprising since section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act already addresses this problem&mdash;the Department of Energy allows generators to temporarily exceed their emissions limits or operate contrary to any environmental law or regulation when needed to respond to an emergency. In fact, 202(c) was invoked on the evening of December 24, and PJM reports that several plants were able to operate for a few additional hours because of that order.</p>

<p>Blaming PJM itself appears to be another popular approach. The fracked gas industry is arguing that the problem was PJM making bad energy forecasts, or PJM notified plants too late to secure the fuel they need.</p>

<p>PJM admits that, while they historically overestimate demand on holiday weekends, this time they underestimated demand by 10 percent. But, to their credit, they also realized they lacked confidence in the forecast and went into the event with a reserve capacity almost ten times higher than they normally would want. That would have been sufficient but for the shockingly high forced outage rate.</p>

<p>The lack of timely notification makes even less sense. PJM reported that in 92 percent of cases, generators gave them one hour or less of notice of outages.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>If these facilities had fuel concerns, they should have reported that to PJM back on December 21 when PJM issued a cold weather alert, and certainly by the time a second alert was issued on December 23.</p>

<p>After years of claiming the mantle as a &ldquo;reliable&rdquo; source of energy, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise that the gas industry is quick to point fingers. Rather than hold themselves accountable for failing Pennsylvanians, they&rsquo;re trying to bend reality so that they don&rsquo;t have to pay for their mistakes. But a cold, hard look at the situation proves that the (fracked gas) emperor has no clothes.</p>

<p><i>What does this mean for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Energy Future?</i><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal""><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p>Not only does someone need to pay to the energy industries failures during December 2022, but policymakers, grid operators, advocates, and industry need to take a critical look at Pennsylvania&rsquo;s energy grid with an eye to reform.</p>

<p>But first we must get past the industry hyperbole. The fracked gas industry is already claiming that the solution is more fracking and more pipelines to create even more oversupply. That simply doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. In addition to the obvious environmental and public health consequences of fracking, the economics just don&rsquo;t work. We would need to spend billions of dollars to over-build vast amounts of infrastructure to guard against shortages, likely causing an unsustainable glut in the market outside of these events. Consumers would ultimately pay far higher energy prices to over-frack the Commonwealth with little benefit.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The real solution is not putting all our eggs in one energy source basket in the first place. If we diversify our generation&mdash;particularly away from resource-constrained fossil fuels and towards non-resource constrained clean, renewable energy&mdash;we will be less exposed to supply chain risks and mechanical failures. If we also invest in energy efficiency, we can mitigate peak demand so there is less need to over-supply the grid in times of crisis. And, if we expand our capacity for energy storage, we will have more flexibility&mdash;and more options&mdash;to manage the grid when we need it most.</p>

<p>Doing all these things requires thoughtful planning and policy, but they are the stalwarts of a modern-day energy system. What the December 2022 energy crisis is teaching us is that Pennsylvania needs to move away from an energy grid steeped in the philosophies of the last century and reflect the needs and technological innovations of today.</p>

<p><i>Conclusions and Next Steps</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Each year, billions of dollars of ratepayer money goes to the fracked gas industry in the form of capacity payments in return for their guarantee that they will be available to power the grid when needed. More than 37 percent of our fracked gas plants couldn&rsquo;t run when needed them most. That raises serious concerns as to the reliability of the energy sources we&rsquo;re paying to underpin the grid. A broader rethink of this energy policy is needed immediately.</p>

<p>But most insidious is how unfair Pennsylvania&rsquo;s energy system has become. It&rsquo;s now dominated by a fracked gas industry propped up by taxpayer subsidies and lax regulations that struggled to keep our lights on. Their failure to live up to their commitments caused energy prices to skyrocket to historic levels. Over time, those costs of these bills&mdash;and even the penalties gas generators incurred&mdash;will be borne by small businesses, households, and other energy users.</p>

<p>In other words, we&rsquo;ve built a Pennsylvania energy grid where taxpayers are paying for the fracking, the pipelines, and the power plants up front through subsidies, but also paying for the cost of their grid, without mentioning the monumental health and environmental costs throughout the fracking process. It&rsquo;s high time that Pennsylvania rolls up its sleeves and re-thinks its energy policies that have created this unfair grid before the next storm causes real blackouts.<o:p></o:p></p>

What We Learned from the December 2022 Deep Freeze: Don’t Rely on Natural Gas When It’s Fracking Cold (Part 1),1/24/2023,"<p><em>This&nbsp;article is the first in a two-part series. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-What-We-Learned-from-the-December-2022-Deep-Freeze-Dont-Rely-on-Natural-Gas-When-Its-Fracking-Cold-Part-2"">Read Part 2: How Fracked Gas Failed Pennsylvania</a>.</em></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">As the 2022 holiday weekend approached, a developing winter storm promised to bring severe cold weather to Pennsylvania. It&rsquo;s in these moments that our infrastructure&mdash;particularly our energy grid&mdash;is needed most and is stress tested. Unfortunately, our grid staggered, nearly leaving our homes in the cold and dark.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The 2022 winter storm is an event that should bring a critical eye to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s increasingly gas-reliant energy mix. Otherwise, we will continue the slide towards becoming an expensive energy state, consistently threatened with energy instability wile energy generators are unfairly enriched.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p><strong><u>December 21</u></strong></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">With forecasts looking ominous, PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM)&mdash;the regional energy grid operator that manages Pennsylvania&mdash;issued a Cold Weather Alert.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>At that time, gas generators should have been alerting PJM if they foresaw problems buying gas on the spot market to support increased consumer demand.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">PJM&rsquo;s plan to ensure we have the power we need is to purchase &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; in addition to energy.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The way the system works, generators who clear the capacity auction get paid to be available, whether they are called on to run and sell energy or not. For the 2022<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""font-size:8.0pt""><span style=""mso-special-character:comment"">&nbsp;</span></span></span>delivery year, those payments totaled about $4 billion. Generators who take this money face steep penalties if they are unable to deliver energy when called so, in theory, companies have an incentive to invest in preventative maintenance, winterization, and other measures to improve reliability and be ready when we need them the most&mdash;at least, that is the plan.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><u><b>December 23</b></u></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">PJM&rsquo;s models forecast a need for 127 gigawatts (GW), but there was a lot of uncertainty. Power plants are complicated and, even in normal times, they are unavailable when called upon about 5 percent of the time. This forced outage rate&mdash;in other words, the number of power plants not running when they were supposed to&mdash;gets higher in extreme weather, climbing to around 10 percent. In addition to worries about forced outages, there is uncertainty predicting the weather and, in this case, uncertainty how demand might change on a holiday weekend. Rather than the 3GW of reserve, back-up capacity that PJM normally considers adequate, the grid operator planned for 29 GW.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Temperatures plummeted, dropping 29 degrees over a 12-hour period&mdash;a steeper decline than the historic 2014 polar vortex.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>With those crashing temperatures, the demand for energy soared, peaking about 10 percent higher than the forecast of 139 GW. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>The 29 GW of reserve capacity should have been more than enough to cover the demand&mdash;if the planned capacity could deliver. Unfortunately, the forced outage rate started to rise.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Early in the morning on Friday, December 23, there were about 12 GW of forced outages. By late Friday night, that climbed to 34 GW. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><u><b>December 24</b></u></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Forced outages peaked at 46 GW. Failures not only included the &ldquo;expected&rdquo; 10 percent of generators that PJM called to run; over 23 percent of PJM&rsquo;s total capacity was unavailable. Worse yet, PJM had little or no notice these plants couldn&rsquo;t run&mdash;in 92 percent of cases, they had less than one-hours&rsquo; notice and, in some cases, no notice at all.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">PJM resorted to a suite of emergency procedures. Most glaring to the average Pennsylvanian were the reports on the news that households were asked to &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; reduce electricity on Christmas Day. PJM was also calling up idling synchronized reserve generators, issuing voltage reduction warnings, and obtaining permission for plants to exceed their emissions limitations, if they had to. PJM even became a net importer of power for a period, relying on neighboring grids to fill in supply gaps. By and large, the lights stayed on, if just barely, but it came at a staggering cost.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">With demand outstripping supply, the costs to consumers soared. Wholesale prices for energy vary, but they are generally under $50 a megawatt-hour (MWh) and often under $30/MWh.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>For comparison, average retail electric prices (which includes local utility charges) were about $100/MWh in PA in 2021.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>During this event, PJM saw wholesale prices for energy peak at $4,300/MWh&mdash;essentially as high as the system is designed to go.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>What this means is that energy purchased by utility companies during the holiday weekend were paying up to 1,000 percent more for that energy than normal&mdash;a cost that will certainly be borne by consumers in some way.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>What went wrong?</strong><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">PJM is expected to issue a full report in mid-April, but preliminary data shows that about 70 percent of the forced outages came from fracked gas plants not operating like they should have . Gas makes up about 50 percent of PJM&rsquo;s generation with over 86 GW installed. At the peak of the crisis on December 24, its forced outage rate was over 37 percent with over 32 GW offline.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Coal was having problems, too, with a forced outage rate of about 16 percent (7.5GW).<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>While the industry touts itself as &ldquo;fuel-secure&rdquo; because piles of coal often sit at the plant and they don&rsquo;t rely on pipelines, they still contend with frozen coal piles, supply-chain issues, and maintenance problems at decades-old plants that cause more than their share of outages.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">PJM&rsquo;s &ldquo;other&rdquo; category, which includes nuclear power and renewables, performed largely as expected with a forced outage rate of about 10 percent.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>In fact, when the data is in, we expect it to show that wind generation performed far better than what PJM had planned.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Claims that fracked gas is a reliable energy source have been circulating for years and, even as recently as 2017, PJM itself <a href=""http://www.pjm.com/~/media/library/reports-notices/special-reports/20170330-pjms-evolving-resource-mix-and-system-reliability.ashx"" target=""_blank"">suggested</a> that as much as 86 percent gas-fired generation on our grid could maintain reliability.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Hypotheticals aside, in December 2022 fracked gas wasn&rsquo;t reliable when we needed it, and consumers ended up paying steep costs&nbsp;for that failure.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The key question is why.</p>

PennFuture and Partners Pave the Way for Erie Environmental Advisory Council,1/6/2023,"<p>After more than a year of advocacy by PennFuture and our partners, Erie City Council this week passed an ordinance creating an <a href=""https://weconservepa.org/eac/eac-basics/"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Advisory Council (EAC)</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second municipality to develop an active EAC in Northwest Pennsylvania, Erie&rsquo;s EAC will build capacity and support community outreach efforts at a time of growing environmental ambitions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is an EAC?</strong></p>

<p>EACs are extensions of municipal governments that focus on environmental conservation and improvement. They provide increased capacity for municipalities to protect their natural resources, communicate with the public, and meet their environmental goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Act 148 of 1973 authorized municipalities to create EACs via ordinance and the model has proven successful. In fact, Erie is now home to the <a href=""https://weconservepa.org/groups/"" target=""_blank"">161<sup>st</sup> EAC in the Commonwealth</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EACs do not make regulatory decisions nor are they independent environmental advisory organizations. They function most effectively when working cooperatively with elected officials, staff, and other authorities and boards.</p>

<p>EACs are comprised of seven voting members that must be municipal residents. Members must have expertise in environmental matters, and they serve three-year terms with staggered initial appointments.</p>

<p><strong>Why is an EAC important for the City of Erie?</strong></p>

<p>The City of Erie is working to reinvent itself by attracting 21st century businesses and bringing people, especially young people, to work, live, and play in the city. Many in the city are also working to address racial inequities and high poverty rates. Today&rsquo;s young adults seek sustainable and socially aware cities where they feel their voices can be heard.</p>

<p>Recent efforts by Mayor Joseph Schember to achieve this future include<a href=""https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/consultant-recommends-city-of-erie-hire-full-time-dei-coordinator-create-diversity-team/ar-AA14fiFw"" target=""_blank""> hiring a diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice consultant</a>; <a href=""https://www.yourerie.com/news/local-news/solar-panels-added-to-erie-central-fire-station/"" target=""_blank"">installing solar panels on the city&rsquo;s fire station</a>; and committing to the city&rsquo;s first <a href=""https://pennwatch.org/dep-and-local-officials-kick-off-2022-23-local-climate-action-program/"" target=""_blank"">climate </a>and <a href=""https://www.fundersnetwork.org/nine-communities-receive-partners-for-places-mini-grants/"" target=""_blank"">environmental justice</a> planning processes.</p>

<p>However, Erie will need more capacity and resources to meet its goals of becoming a more sustainable city. A well-functioning EAC that works with government is a low-cost way to expand the city&rsquo;s capacity to reach this goal. In addition to advising city departments on environmental matters, an EAC can expand outreach to Erie residents, especially when planning and decision-making will impact them. This increased public involvement will go far to bring residents to the table and to elevate their voices - two important aspects for addressing injustice.</p>

<p>Mayor Schember stated a desire to create a body to advise him on climate and environmental matters in his first term. Environmental groups supported this but recognized an opportunity to implement a model that could transcend any one administration. In alignment with <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/ErieCommonAgenda_6.pdf""><em>Our Water, Our Future: A Common Agenda for Protecting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Lake Erie Watershed</em></a>, a codified EAC was recommended that would be much more difficult for a future administration to dismantle.</p>

<p><strong>What actions led to EAC ordinance passage?</strong></p>

<p>Mayor Schember and City Sustainability Coordinator Sarah Peelman welcomed the input of PennFuture and our partners, based on the Common Agenda. As a result, the following individuals embarked on a campaign to create a City of Erie EAC:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Images/EAC-List-Test-2.PNG"" style=""width: 800px; height: 180px;"" /></p>

<p>The team researched best practices and met with several existing EACs before providing a proposal to the Mayor and City Council President. This proposal included a 12-step &ldquo;roadmap&rdquo; for Erie EAC creation. Recommended action included interagency and community outreach. The group then drafted an EAC ordinance based on examples from other cities and submitted this to the Mayor, City Council, and the City Solicitor for review.</p>

<p>PennFuture is thankful for the support of the mayor and City Council. Still, passing the EAC ordinance was not without its challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final ordinance included language that requires the EAC only research and focus on those initiatives dictated by the mayor and City Council. However, the first power EACs hold, as outlined in the state governing legislation, is to &ldquo;identify environmental problems and recommend plans and programs&hellip;&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the EAC is unable to study additional issues, the council would be left vulnerable to individual interests of elected officials, rather than be accountable to needs of the community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EACs that our partnership consulted maintain a cooperative working relationship with elected officials, but the council leaders are trusted as experts, left to conduct public outreach, identify issues, and make recommendations accordingly. Leaders can then choose whether to act upon those recommendations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture and our partners chose to support the final ordinance language because we believe qualified EAC appointees will gain the trust of leaders. However, if political threats arise, we will defend the rightful duties of the EAC.</p>

<p><strong>What are the next steps for the Erie EAC?</strong></p>

<p>It is vitally important that the city receive diverse, passionate, and qualified applicants to serve on the EAC. Four appointments will be made by Council and three by the mayor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are a qualified resident of the City of Erie, apply to serve! Encourage friends and colleagues to apply too! <a href=""mailto:tompkins@pennfuture.org"">Please reach out to Erie Campaign Manager Jenny Tompkins</a> if you would like additional information.</p>

<p>Passage of the EAC ordinance was made possible by months of collaborative educational and outreach efforts. It is the hope that this initial work of the advocacy team will provide a foundation for new EAC members to build from. The EAC framework, now implemented by 160 communities, has the potential to provide great benefit to the City of Erie and its residents. Erie&rsquo;s leaders must give it space to do so.</p>

Delaware River Basin Commission’s New Fracking Regulations Mark Incremental Progress,12/27/2022,"<p>This month, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) finalized regulations banning the discharge of fracking wastewater within the basin. Additional&nbsp;regulations regard&nbsp;the import and export of water for fracking purposes outside of the Delaware watershed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>DRBC seems to have at last heeded&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2022-02-28-PennFuture-Comments-DRBC-Fracking-Wastewater-Ban.pdf"">calls from PennFuture</a>&nbsp;and others that&nbsp;final regulations needed to be tightened,&nbsp;closing&nbsp;loopholes that had allowed fracking wastewater and byproducts to potentially harm the basin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DRBC&rsquo;s regulations clearly recognize that fracking wastewater is so toxic that it poses &ldquo;significant, immediate and long-term risks&rdquo; to water resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a rundown on what this all means for the Delaware River Basin&rsquo;s environment and for the communities that rely upon its water supplies.</p>

<p><strong>Where does fracking stand in the Delaware River Basin?</strong></p>

<p>Fracking is banned! Following on the heels of a decade-long de facto moratorium on fracking and all fracking-related activities, the <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fracking-Banned-in-Delaware-River-Basin"">DRBC banned fracking in the Delaware River Basin in 2021</a>. This ban protects our water resources and our communities from the known dangers from the physical act of fracking!</p>

<p><strong>But what about fracking wastewater?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Well, that depends. The DRBC&rsquo;s final regulations prohibiting the &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; of fracking wastewater is great news. The final regulations add clarity to the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-DRBC-Proposed-Regulations-Ban-Discharge-of-Fracking-Wastewater-Discourages-Fracking-Related-Interbasin-Water-Transfers"">October 2021 draft regulations </a>that ban fracking wastewater and byproducts such as:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Road spreading of fracking wastewater</li>
	<li>Injection of fracking wastewater into deep well for storage/disposal</li>
	<li>Disposal of fracking wastewater in landfills</li>
	<li>Discharge of leachate from landfills that accept fracking waste, including after treatment&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, the DRBC clarified that &ldquo;wastewater&rdquo; includes wastewater, brine, and sludge that contains fracking contaminates, even if that wastewater was treated. The Commission also made explicit that the discharge ban includes any type of discharge, whether on land or directly into the waters, and whether intentional or unintentional.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What about risks from transporting fracking wastewater?</strong></p>

<p>The DRBC&rsquo;s final regulations still allow for the transport, storage, transfer, process, and reuse of fracking wastewater within the basin, which carry with them the possibility of spills and leakage that could irreparably damage the Delaware&rsquo;s water resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The DRBC anticipates &ldquo;only low volumes&rdquo; of fracking wastewater to be transported to or through the Basin, arguing that this reduces the &ldquo;number of probable spills.&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-New-Report-Details-the-Use-of-Forever-Chemicals-in-Fracking-Operations-Despite-Serious-Concerns-to-Public-Health"">Fracking wastewater is highly toxic</a>. DRBC&rsquo;s regulations, therefore, do not seem to be stringent enough to protect the heath of our communities or our environment. Despite our knowledge of how harmful this wastewater is, there are still many potentially toxic components which we still don&rsquo;t know about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a way to alleviate these concerns, the DRBC has argued that there is a &ldquo;high bar&rdquo; for approval of any importation of wastewater into the basin. To that end, PennFuture will be diligent in monitoring any applications to the DRBC regarding the importation of fracking wastewater into the basin to ensure that the Commission adheres to its duty to protect the Delaware from harm.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What about the use of Delaware River Basin water for fracking outside of the basin?</strong></p>

<p>The DRBC refused to ban or limit the use of basin water for fracking activities elsewhere. Instead, the Commission argued that its current regulations of the expiration of water should be stringent enough to protect the watershed from over-extraction of water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DRBC has argued that an application for water exportation by a fracking company is highly unlikely to meet the standards and requirements to merit a permit. The Commission&rsquo;s duty through this review is to ensure, by evaluating a series of factors, that there is &ldquo;no harm&rdquo; to the basin&rsquo;s water resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are hopeful that the DRBC will adhere strictly to its duty and regulations and reject any water exportation request that does not meet these stringent standards&mdash;regardless of whether it&rsquo;s for fracking or any other activity outside the Basin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, these final fracking wastewater regulations are very much an improvement over the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Public-Comment-Closes-on-DRBC-Fracking-Regulations"">regulations originally drafted in 2018</a>. PennFuture fully supports the clear prohibition of discharges of fracking wastewater within the Delaware River Basin, as well as DRBC&rsquo;s efforts to clarify and strengthen that prohibition following recent public comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While we are unhappy that there still remain opportunities for fracking wastewater to be brought into the Basin&mdash;and with it the potential to irreparably harm our waters and communities&mdash;we are hopeful that the DRBC will do everything in its power to minimize those potential harms.</p>

PennFuture and Partners Convince EPA to Upgrade Delaware River Water Quality Standards,12/20/2022,"<p>Back in April, PennFuture and our partners filed a petition to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), requesting a new water quality standard for dissolved oxygen for the urban stretch of the Delaware River. On December 1, the EPA took the rare step and granted our petition!&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it might sound like a technical issue, this is a major development for our continued efforts to upgrade and protect the Delaware River estuary&mdash;the 38-mile stretch of the river from Trenton to the top of the Delaware Bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The petition raised critical questions surrounding what defines &ldquo;existing use&rdquo; of this stretch of the river and how data-driven evidence demonstrates that existing use.&nbsp; The problem here is that there is solid evidence that fish propagation is occurring in this section of the river. This evidence of an &ldquo;existing use&rdquo; formed the basis for our petition to EPA to upgrade the designated use to include propagation of fish.</p>

<p>As we explain below, PennFuture and our partners had petitioned the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) years ago to recognize the propagation of fish and set appropriate standards to protect it. However, DRBC, the intergovernmental agency responsible for water quality protections in the Delaware River watershed, has failed to act on our petition in a timely manner. And so the time had come for us to petition EPA to step in and take control to protect the river under their overarching authority under the federal Clean Water Act.</p>

<p><strong>The law.</strong>&nbsp;The federal Clean Water Act requires that regulators determine the &ldquo;existing use&rdquo; of a waterbody and establish a &ldquo;designated use&rdquo; that matches or goes beyond the existing use. At the moment, the designated use&mdash;with regard to aquatic life&mdash;is defined as &ldquo;maintenance of resident fish and other aquatic life&rdquo; and &ldquo;passage for migratory fish.&rdquo;&nbsp; The currently applicable standards, in these zones of the River, do not include protections to provide for the &ldquo;propagation of fish.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The science.</strong> Based on the &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; designated use, the DRBC set a dissolved oxygen standard of 3.5 mg/L. Dissolved oxygen is required to support aquatic life. Yet pollution from industry, insufficiently treated sewage from wastewater plants, and the pollution carried to the river from our streets during rain events can have dramatic impacts on the ecosystem. High levels of pollution adversely affect aquatic habitats, potentially causing harmful algal blooms, which deprive the river of oxygen and create dead zones for other life. And the more sensitive juvenile fish populations that are present in areas where propagation of fish occur need a higher level of dissolved oxygen than those areas where only maintenance of adult populations is needed. Upgrading the designated use of this section of the river should result in the creation of higher dissolved oxygen standards necessary to protect all live stages of fish.</p>

<p><strong>The evidence</strong>. Federally-protected Atlantic Sturgeon can be found in this stretch of the river&mdash;living and spawning, not just migrating through&mdash;and therefore need a higher dissolved oxygen standard in order to survive. The argument is simple. The fish are existing there, and this &ldquo;existing use&rdquo; by the sturgeon needs to be recognized by law.</p>

<p>This issue has been brewing for years. In 2013, Delaware Riverkeeper Network (DRN) and other organizations submitted an initial petition to the DRBC, urging it to recognize the emerging data that fish are now spawning in all zones of the Delaware Estuary. In 2021, DRN, PennFuture and others filed a supplemental petition with the DRBC, pointing to additional evidence of fish propagation and urging DRBC to move faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture and our partners remain frustrated with the DRBC&rsquo;s delay and inaction. PennFuture, DRN, and others filed a petition to the EPA in April, requesting:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>EPA issue a rule that revises the designated uses for these urban zones to include a) maintenance and propagation of resident fish and other aquatic life, and b) spawning and nursery habitat for anadromous fish</li>
	<li>EPA upgrade the dissolved oxygen standard from 3.5 mg/L to 6/3 mg/L</li>
</ul>

<p>On December 1, EPA granted the petition for rulemaking and set out a 12-month timeline for establishing new water quality standards for dissolved oxygen in this part of the Delaware. In making this determination, EPA found that &ldquo;&lsquo;propagation of fish&rsquo;&rdquo; is &ldquo;attainable&rdquo; and that the &ldquo;currently applicable dissolved oxygen criterion for these zones is not sufficient to protect propagation.&rdquo; EPA determined, in other words, that the dissolved oxygen standard needs to be higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still to be determined is exactly what that higher standard will be. EPA expects to release draft regulations by 2024, which will be addressed in the years thereafter by the DRBC and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), as well as the environmental agencies of New Jersey and Delaware. The higher water quality standards will then be implemented by upgrading wastewater treatment plants along the estuary as well as by creating more stringent permits for polluters along the river. Fortunately, significant increases in state and federal infrastructure funding could, in part, be used for these wastewater treatment plant upgrades.</p>

<p>PennFuture is committed to ensure the Delaware River&rsquo;s new standards will protect the survival of the sturgeon as well as the health of other aquatic life in the basin.&nbsp; Millions of residents use the Delaware River for recreation, food, and work. Our goal is to make sure that they will be able to do so for years to come.</p>

Distribution Centers Bring into Focus Limitations of Local Zoning Laws,11/2/2022,"<p>Northeast Pennsylvania&rsquo;s growing proliferation of large-scale distribution centers is threatening the high-quality waterways of the Pocono Mountains. This region is home to a high concentration of special protection streams &ndash; some of the healthiest waters in the state &ndash; and serves as the headwaters of the Delaware River. While High Quality and Exceptional Value waters do receive legal protection, irresponsible and poorly sited development projects can still cause degradation when local land use policies fail to uphold these protections.</p>

<p>The approval process for land use projects can be cumbersome and difficult to follow, but a recent decision made by local officials in Monroe County provides an excellent example of why paying close attention to zoning ordinances can be advantageous. On October 26, the Coolbaugh Township Zoning Hearing Board voted unanimously to deny a special exception for a 426,000-square-foot distribution center. The project was pitched as a &quot;warehouse&quot; and proposed for a 48-acre tract of land located in a commercial district. While warehouses are a permitted use in this district as a special exception, &ldquo;distribution centers&rdquo; are not, and the developer did not demonstrate that it adhered to the definition of a warehouse. The township had thoughtful zoning on the books. Applying these zoning ordinances ensured that the proposed use was appropriately sited.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, some background on zoning practices. While municipalities in Pennsylvania must legally allow for every &quot;use&quot; within its borders, zoning districts determine where those uses are located. Districts include but are not limited to commercial, industrial, residential, and open space. Within those districts, municipal officials can list which uses are automatically allowed, which are not allowed, and which require a special exemption that will need to meet conditions placed on the project by officials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initial zoning ordinances did not anticipate the large-scale industrial nature of distribution centers, which are vastly different from what was considered a &quot;warehouse&quot; 10, 20, 50 years ago. This means that warehouses and distribution centers are likely no longer appropriate uses in commercial or village districts, as they were previously considered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is critical to note the distinction made in the zoning ordinance between warehouses and distribution centers. Essentially, a warehouse is designed for the indoor storage, transfer, and distribution of goods, but crucially, it does not include a truck terminal. Meanwhile, a distribution center receives, stores, and distributes goods. This definition includes the redistribution and consolidation of orders, as well as the storage, parking, and servicing of trucks. The distinction is clear. While the township did not decide that the proposed project was a distribution center, they did determine that the applicant failed to show that it was a warehouse.</p>

<p>In short, the Coolbaugh Township Zoning Hearing Board&rsquo;s decision last month utilized the tools it had under its zoning ordinance to ensure that this type of large-scale industrial development was appropriately sited in the township.</p>

<p>This is a critical victory for special protection streams in the Poconos. Had the Coolbaugh project moved forward, stormwater on the property would have naturally flowed into the Tobyhanna, a High Quality creek, increasing the likelihood of degradation. Thermal impacts and contamination from salt and chemicals carried by stormwater runoff can create a potentially toxic environment for wildlife. Additionally, the paved surface of parking lots also generally increases and speeds up the flow of runoff into streams, leading to more frequent and severe flooding events.</p>

<p>Unless municipalities take a watershed-wide approach to land use, industrial development risks causing &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot; to local waterways. Long-lasting and devastating impacts are magnified when one distribution center turns into many. Just a single 300,000-square-foot distribution center can cause long-lasting negative impacts on the environment through stormwater pollution. But consider the massive impact of several of these projects in a condensed area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, in Pocono and Jackson Township, there are upwards of four warehouses being proposed, totalling over 1.5 million square feet, all within a few miles of each other and some projects proposed on adjacent properties. Our streams will not be all that suffers from this onslaught as neighboring homes and businesses will have to contend with air pollution, noise pollution, light pollution, and traffic impacts. While one distribution center may make sense in a properly sited industrial zone, it is less sensible to develop several all within a commercial zone bordering homes or special protection streams. When municipalities review their zoning ordinances, the cumulative impacts of multiple large-scale projects must be considered because the harm caused to the environment and surrounding communities becomes exponential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>County-wide or multi-municipality planning and zoning could provide for just this type of holistic approach to warehouse and distribution center development. If the zoning issues in the Poconos are not addressed, this region known for clean water, clean air, open space, and outdoor recreation will be unrecognizable as it evolves into a busy industrial zone with poor air quality, degraded streams, and traffic congestion.</p>

<p>Coolbaugh Township was lucky to have &ndash; and apply &ndash; zoning that recognized these issues. Similarly, Pocono Township is attempting to be responsive to the threat by beginning the curative amendment process to fix problems with its zoning related to distribution centers and warehouses.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.wordpress.com/2022/05/11/pocono-residents-support-more-action-to-protect-exceptional-value-streams-new-poll-finds/"">More than 98 percent of Pocono residents </a>believe that more must be done to protect local waterways from large-scale commercial and industrial development.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, &quot;we all live downstream.&quot; It is not just the immediate community and ecosystem that will experience the consequences of development-fueled degradation. Neighboring communities and even those that live miles downstream will feel the impact. Our pristine Pocono streams protect the quality of drinking water for 13 million people that live downstream, and they also contribute to the health of the region&#39;s outdoor recreation economy. These outstanding waters must be considered when making consequential land use decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proliferation of distribution centers provides municipal officials reason to take a more holistic approach toward their&nbsp;zoning ordinances. They have widespread support among residents, who have been showing up to meetings in droves, demanding action. Our local leaders have the tools at their fingertips. Now is the time to act before it&#39;s too late.</p>

Erie’s Stormwater Fee Program Becomes Reality,10/19/2022,"<p>Today&nbsp;Erie City Council passed a much-anticipated stormwater user fee. The fee creates a dedicated fund for long-overdue stormwater maintenance and, more importantly, for stormwater-management improvements that bring environmental, economic, and human health benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Six major streams wind their way through the City of Erie. All are deemed &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; under the Clean Water Act due to excessive sediment pollution caused by runoff. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection requires the city to reduce these sediments by 10 percent over five years by implementing a <a href=""https://cityof.erie.pa.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Erie-PRP-2022-Final-Draft-updated-5-11-22-rev1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pollutant Reduction Plan (PRP).</a> A stormwater engineer was recently hired by the city, with plans to fund the position over the long term using revenue from the stormwater fee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stormwater funding aimed at capital improvements will promote public safety and ultimately save money. Over the past 70 years, Erie experienced <a href=""https://glisa.umich.edu/climate-change-in-the-great-lakes-region-references/"" target=""_blank"">a more than 10-percent increase in total annual precipitation</a> and a 35-percent increase in the amount of precipitation during heavy storms. Recently, the City experienced significant flooding after more than <a href=""https://www.goerie.com/story/news/local/2022/09/28/erie-pa-sets-rainfall-record-for-sept-27-reports-flooded-roads-creeks/69523245007/"" target=""_blank"">2.5 rapid inches of rainfall</a> fell on the region. Past massive storms led to the <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/flooded-erie-home-2-dead/"" target=""_blank"">drowning of two people in 2017 </a>and emergency infrastructure failures, such as the East Fifth Street storm sewer failure in 2021, which <a href=""https://www.goerie.com/story/news/local/2021/09/01/garrison-run-east-erie-storm-sewer-failure-cost-least-1-2-m-infrastructure-stormwater/5654320001/"" target=""_blank"">cost the city over $1.2 million for repairs</a>. With over 500 miles of stormwater infrastructure, a significant portion of which is over a century old, the city needs this dedicated fee funding to protect all residents and businesses.</p>

<p>Creation of the fee program also directly aligns with recommendations in <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/ErieCommonAgenda_6.pdf""><em>Our Water, Our Future: A Common Agenda for Protecting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Lake Erie Watershed</em></a>. In collaboration with other area environmental organizations, PennFuture determined pollution caused by surface runoff, including urban stormwater runoff, to be the largest direct threat to our regional water quality. Recommended strategies to mitigate this threat at the local level include creation of a multi-municipal stormwater authority and a county-wide stormwater fee. Though scaled down from the <em>Common Agenda</em>&rsquo;s proposal, we support Mayor Joseph Schember&rsquo;s decision to advocate for a fee.</p>

<p>Collaboration across state, county, and local entities was critical to advance the stormwater fee. In 2019, the City&rsquo;s consultants recommended adoption of a stormwater fee as one strategy to combat the city&rsquo;s financial vulnerability. The DEP&rsquo;s Office of the Great Lakes, Erie County Department of Planning and Community Development, City of Erie, and Millcreek Township then worked together to obtain funding for a 2021 feasibility study of stormwater fees for the county&rsquo;s two largest municipalities. An expert stormwater program consultancy, Wood Consulting, who notably assisted in the development of nearby Meadville&rsquo;s fee in 2012, was contracted to complete the study. Though Millcreek Township elected to not yet enact a fee after the conclusion of the feasibility study, the city opted to move forward with a fee ordinance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The resulting proposed fee structure is built upon the same foundation outlined in PennFuture&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PennFuture_StormwaterManual_web_3.20.17.pdf"">Model Stormwater Management Fee Ordinance (2017)</a>. Both ordinances charge a stormwater user fee to all property owners, regardless of taxable status, based on their property&rsquo;s amount of impervious surface area. The fee structure relies on the concept of an &ldquo;equivalent residential unit&rdquo; representing the average impervious surface area of a residential tax parcel. Once the ERU is calculated, the desired revenue from the annual fee is divided by the estimated total count of ERUs across the City to determine the fee per ERU. For non-residential properties, ERUs are totaled and billed accordingly. In many other municipalities, residential property owners are all charged a fee of one ERU, regardless of how much impervious surface they have. However, the city sought to make costs more equitable for residential payers by creating three payment tiers based on housing footprints. As a result, residential payers will only pay between $12 and $36 per year. In a comparison of other fees across Pennsylvania, the <a href=""https://cityof.erie.pa.us/stormwater/"" target=""_blank"">City of Erie&rsquo;s low residential costs stand out.</a> The city has pledged to not raise fees for five years.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.goerie.com/story/news/local/2021/12/01/no-erie-pa-stormwater-fee-now-city-council-rejects-proposal/8808404002/"" target=""_blank"">Council rejected a fee ordinance with a 4-3 vote in late 2021</a>, citing a lack of sufficient detail. Stormwater fee programs often allow utility payers to reduce their annual fee (i.e. obtain &ldquo;credits&rdquo;) by implementing best management practices to mitigate volume and/or rate of runoff from their properties. In response, Wood Consulting and the city administration have since crafted a fee credit policy with input from a 12-member Stormwater Credit Advisory Committee. The resulting credit policy, presented to Council ahead of a second attempt to enact a fee, allows for a generous 45 percent maximum credit for commercial and institutional fee payers. PennFuture and our partners support this new credit policy and are glad that it ultimately received the support of Council.</p>

<p>Erie now joins <a href=""https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=seas_faculty_pubs"" target=""_blank"">over three dozen Pennsylvania municipalities collecting stormwater fees,</a> including counterparts in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Allentown, Lancaster, Bethlehem, and nearby Meadville. As outlined in the Our Water, Our Future Campaign, stormwater fees provide capacity to tackle a primary source of pollution in our watershed: urban stormwater runoff. We applaud City Council for its decision to approve the stormwater fee ordinance, following through on the recommendations and efforts of so many stakeholders, including PennFuture and our partners.</p>

The Clean Water Act’s 50-Year Impact on Pennsylvania,10/18/2022,"<p>As we<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/17/a-proclamation-on-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-clean-water-act/"" target=""_blank""> celebrate 50 years</a> of the groundbreaking Clean Water Act, I&rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to reflect on what it means to PennFuture, Pennsylvanians, and our over 86,000 miles of streams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has a long history of polluted waterways, due in major part to our economy&rsquo;s historical reliance on extractive industries. In particular, coal mining&rsquo;s&nbsp;toxic legacy remains the leading cause for the on-going&nbsp;impairment of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters. More than <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/OurCommonWealth/Pages/Article.aspx?post=92"" target=""_blank"">5,550 miles of streams</a> are still impacted by acid mine drainage from abandoned coal mines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Extractive industries continue to damage Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways. In particular, the fracking industry has <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/dimock/"" target=""_blank"">recklessly polluted</a> streams and groundwater across the state &ndash; through the<a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-fracking-gas-drilling-tainted-water-dimock-criminal-case-20220218.html"" target=""_blank""> fracking process itself</a> or through construction of <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/mariner-east-builder-sunoco-agrees-to-4m-settlement-over-marsh-creek-lake-spill/"" target=""_blank"">pipeline infrastructure</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As far back as 1905, the Purity of Waters Act set limits on how much sewage could be added to the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters. And yet, even from the beginning, some of the largest water polluters - namely coal mines and tanneries - were specifically exempted from this law. As water pollution continued to worsen, Pennsylvania enacted the Clean Streams Law in 1937 to strengthen discharge limits and to increase coverage and penalties. And yet still, coal mines were exempted from this law. Nor did the Clean Streams Law require restoration of degraded waterways. In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t until significant amendments in 1945 that the Clean Streams Law included discharges from coal mines and required the industry to develop and implement a plan for reducing these toxic discharges from fouling our waters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, despite these rules, enforcement remained lackluster. The number of polluted streams continued to increase as industrial activity overtook our waters. This led the Clean Streams Law to be amended again in 1965, significantly strengthening the regulation of water pollution discharges &ndash; specifically for coal mines &ndash; while requiring that polluters restore degraded waters and attempt to prevent their degradation in the first place. And yet our waterways still suffered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, the federal government recognized that states were ill equipped to prevent water pollution. Rather than rely on a patchwork quilt of water protection laws at the state level, on October 18, 1972, the Clean Water Act (officially the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972) was signed into law (over President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s veto).&nbsp;</p>

<p>This groundbreaking law set forth the goal to &ldquo;restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation&rsquo;s waters.&rdquo; Focused on discharges of pollution from point sources into waters of the United States, the Clean Water Act (CWA) aimed to prevent, reduce, and eliminate water pollution through the development of water quality standards and limitations set forth in permits. Critically, the CWA imposes the concept of &ldquo;antidegradation&rdquo; into the regulatory scheme, meaning that once a waterway reaches a level of water quality,<a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/AboutDEP/Testimony/Pennsylvania%20Joint%20Letter%20on%20WOTUS.pdf"" target=""_blank""> that level cannot be degraded</a>. The federal backstop created by the CWA is especially important for states like Pennsylvania where some of our most ecologically sensitive and economically important streams and creeks are all too often polluted with no regard to the value &ndash; or &ldquo;use&rdquo; &ndash; of those waters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the CWA was hopeful that we would meet these laudable goals by 1985, we are still struggling to protect and restore our waters today. That is not to say that the CWA has not been successful; it most certainly has. We no longer have <a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444/"" target=""_blank"">burning rivers </a>and many of our rivers have seen a resurgence in aquatic life once struggling on the brink of extinction. People no longer turn their backs to the rivers and creeks that once provided so much recreational and economic opportunities for our communities. The CWA has significantly reduced raw sewage from being directly dumped into our waters. We have more &ldquo;fishable and swimmable&rdquo; waters than we did 50 years ago!&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the problem is clearly bigger than anticipated, and with the CWA failing to regulate most non-point source discharges (e.g., stormwater runoff) and groundwater, there are regulatory holes that allow for water pollution and degradation to continue. (Good news: the Clean Streams Law covers groundwater!) With developers and industry continuing to challenge the applicability of the CWA (<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Reasons-to-Remain-Hopeful-as-Supreme-Court-Rules-on-Clean-Water-Acts-Future"">here&#39;s the latest example</a>), the constantly uphill battle can often seem overwhelming for environmentalists and conservationists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most important components of the CWA is how the law allowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the Chesapeake Bay in 2010. Imposition of a TMDL (think of it as a &ldquo;pollution diet&rdquo;) was necessary to prevent pollution and clean up the Bay after decades of sediment and nutrient pollution took it to the brink. These pollutants are primarily from wastewater and non-point source runoff, resulting in murky waters and harmful algae blooms that threaten aquatic vegetation and organisms, while lowering the dissolved oxygen levels that are critical for the survival of aquatic life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed TMDL means that pollution inputs on the Susquehanna River &ndash; the main tributary to the Bay &ndash; must be significantly cut, improving water quality for Pennsylvanians as well as downstream communities. Recognizing this benefit to the water quality of one of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s largest river systems, PennFuture has worked to support efforts to reduce pollution to the Susquehanna River. When agricultural interests initially challenged the Bay TMDL in federal court, <a href=""https://www.courthousenews.com/epa-prevails-in-fight-over-chesapeake-bay/"" target=""_blank"">PennFuture successfully intervened to support EPA</a>. And yet, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/chesapeakebay"">Pennsylvania is failing to meet these TMDL goals</a>. And so we lobby in Harrisburg for <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Final-Chesapeake-report.pdf"">funding for pollution reduction programs</a> and press for robust water quality protections in permits and agency programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, PennFuture continues to wrestle with protecting and restoring the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters, and we are grateful that the CWA is there along the way, supporting our efforts. CWA has allowed for Pennsylvania to enact stronger state laws that protect water quality, protecting those state laws from legislative rollbacks. Our attorneys rely on the CWA in defending our waters and enforcing against polluters. And when the jurisdiction of the CWA has been threatened over the years, <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/AboutDEP/Testimony/Pennsylvania%20Joint%20Letter%20on%20WOTUS.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pennsylvania has stepped up</a> in calling for robust protections at the federal level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is lucky to have both tens of thousands of miles of streams and robust water protection laws. However, without enactment of the CWA 50 years ago, our history of allowing industries to pollute those waters could have undermined the overall health of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters. PennFuture celebrates the enactment of the Clean Water Act and will continue to fight to protect our waters under it.</p>

Upholding the True Meaning of Pennsylvania’s Environmental Rights Amendment,10/12/2022,"<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recently handed down a decision upholding the ban on fracking in the Delaware River basin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The decision is the latest in a series of legal disputes over the state&rsquo;s constitutional protections for the Delaware River &mdash; and all waterways throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Back in February 2021, after a lengthy de facto moratorium, the Delaware River Basin Commission officially issued regulations <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fracking-Banned-in-Delaware-River-Basin"">banning fracking </a>in the basin in February 2021. (Some parts of this regulation relating to wastewater and water transfers remain to be finalized.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some members of our Pennsylvania legislature, acting as individual legislators and not on behalf of the whole legislature, brought a challenge in federal court, asserting that they were legally harmed by the fracking ban and asking the court to overturn it. PennFuture and a number of our partner organizations are particularly concerned about the legislators&rsquo; argument that they are trustees of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources under our Environmental Rights Amendment, and that they have a duty to increase the value of the trust by fracking. We strongly disagree and, earlier this year, filed a brief with the federal district court explaining that the ERA in no way supports the legislators&rsquo; arguments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately the district court <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Federal-Court-Dismissed-Lawsuit-Challenging-DRBCs-Ban-on-Fracking"">agreed </a>and dismissed the legislators&rsquo; case for lack of standing, finding that the legislators did not have an actual legal injury upon which to make a claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The legislators appealed to the Third Circuit, and again PennFuture and our partners filed an amicus brief to set the record straight on the ERA. We explained that the individual legislators were not trustees under the ERA, and even if they were, trustees would not be under a duty to frack. Instead, we explained, the ERA requires that trustees conserve and maintain trust assets, including the water resources of the Delaware River basin.</p>

<p>The Third Circuit agreed, issuing an <a href=""https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/212315p.pdf"" target=""_blank"">opinion </a>that affirmed the district court&rsquo;s dismissal of the legislators&rsquo; claims. First the Court found that the individual legislators lacked standing to assert institutional injuries belonging to the legislature as a whole. The Court wrote that the legislators&rsquo; claims are &ldquo;classic examples of institutional injuries because they sound in a general loss of legislative power.&rdquo; Moreover, the legislators, as individuals, were not authorized to represent the interests of those institutions in court. If the legislature or the Commonwealth as a whole were injured, the Attorney General would be the party for representing the Commonwealth, not individual legislators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court also addressed the argument that the legislators had standing to challenge the ban as trustees of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s natural resources under the ERA. The court found this &ldquo;legally creative&rdquo; but that it &ldquo;falls short.&rdquo; The Court, referring to our brief, agreed with us that the legislators&rsquo; view of the ERA would &ldquo;turn it upside down.&rdquo; The ERA trust is not a &ldquo;run-of-the-mill financial trust in which the trustees have a duty to maximize profits.&rdquo; Instead, the trust must &ldquo;conserve and maintain&rdquo; our public natural resources. The Court engaged in an analysis of trust responsibilities and concluded that &ldquo;the ban promotes the purposes of the trust and protects its corpus&rdquo; by preventing our public natural resources from being depleted.</p>

<p>The ERA is one of the most important tools that Pennsylvanians have to defend against exploitation of our natural resources and ensure that future generations will be able to breathe pure air and enjoy clean water. We will continue to fight - even against our own legislators when we need to - to defend the rights that the ERA guarantees to the people of the Commonwealth.</p>

Reasons to Remain Hopeful as Supreme Court Rules on Clean Water Act’s Future,10/4/2022,"<p>On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the federal Clean Water Act, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument on the case of <i>Sackett v. EPA</i>, which has the very likely potential to severely curtail the types of waters that are automatically protected by the Act.</p>

<p>The Clean Water Act (CWA or the Act) &ldquo;restore[s] and maintain[s] the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nations&rsquo; waters&rdquo; by asserting jurisdiction over &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; (often referred to as WOTUS). At issue before the Supreme Court is what is included in the definition of WOTUS&mdash;which waters are &ldquo;jurisdictional&rdquo; and therefore protected by the CWA. In particular the Court was focused on when and whether wetlands are covered by the Act.</p>

<p>WOTUS could perhaps be the most hotly contested CWA issue over the past 50 years. This issue has been a battle before the Supreme Court <a href=""https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/2022/06/sackett-v-epa-and-the-definition-of-waters-of-the-united-states/"" style=""text-decoration-line: none;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(5, 99, 193); font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">three times</span></a><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> already and each of the past three presidential administrations have come out with </span><a href=""https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/2017/09/defining-waters-of-the-united-states-clean-water-rule/"" style=""text-decoration-line: none;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(5, 99, 193); font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">multiple rules</span></a><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> defining WOTUS. Yet we still don&rsquo;t have a clear rule.</span></p>

<p>This is mostly because there was a 4-1-4 split at the Supreme Court in the 2006 case of <span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Rapanos v. EPA</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">. This means that there were two competing tests for jurisdiction: Justice Scalia&rsquo;s &ldquo;continuous surface connection&rdquo; test, which would restrict jurisdiction to only those wetlands that that have a physical surface connection to waters; and Justice Kennedy&rsquo;s &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; test which recognized that wetlands impact water quality of hydrologically connected waters, even if that connection is below the surface.&nbsp; With no clear rule set forth by the Supreme Court, subsequent lower court decisions disagreed on how to apply the law, with most courts agreeing that Justice Kennedy&rsquo;s significant nexus test is a minimum for jurisdiction, but no court holding that a water is jurisdictional only if it meets Justice Scalia&rsquo;s &ldquo;continuous surface connection&rdquo; test.</span></p>

<p>The Sackett&nbsp;family have already been in front of the Supreme Court on just this issue. In 2004, Michael and Chantell Sackett bought a piece of property near Priest Lake in Idaho that was previously defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a jurisdictional wetland. Because of that, the couple was prevented from filling in the wetland without a CWA permit to build a house. The couple sued EPA, arguing that the CWA didn&rsquo;t apply to their property because it wasn&rsquo;t a WOTUS; the case made its way to the Supreme Court on procedural issues and was remanded to the District Court, which in 2019 upheld EPA&rsquo;s determination that the wetland was jurisdictional under the &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; test (the wetlands were adjacent to and had a subsurface connection to a navigable body of water).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The case presently before the Supreme Court asks &ldquo;whether the [federal Court of Appeals] set forth the proper test for determining whether wetlands are &lsquo;waters of the United States&rsquo; under the Clean Water Act.&rdquo; Essentially, the Sacketts are asking the court to reject the significant nexus test in favor of the more limiting &ldquo;continuous surface connection&rdquo; test offered by Justice Scalia. In fact, they are asking the Court to apply an even-more stringent two-part test that would go further than even Justice Scalia in <span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Rapanos.</span></p>

<p>Over the past decade, EPA, state agencies, and many of the federal courts across the country have been applying the significant nexus test as the appropriate and scientifically-supported method for determining CWA jurisdiction. There has been much litigation over the agencies&rsquo; proposed WOTUS rules in that time, something that we don&rsquo;t have to time to go into in this blog post (but see <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-New-Definition-of-Waters-of-the-United-States-Threatens-Clean-Water-Act-Protections"" style=""text-decoration-line: none;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(5, 99, 193); font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> if you&rsquo;re curious). Suffice it to say, no administration and no agency has ever thought a test as limiting as the one presently offered by the Sacketts was an appropriate test &ndash; not even the previous administration&rsquo;s </span><a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-New-Definition-of-Waters-of-the-United-States-Threatens-Clean-Water-Act-Protections"" style=""text-decoration-line: none;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(5, 99, 193); font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">proposed rule</span></a><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> that so severely curtailed the jurisdiction of the CWA that it was labeled the &ldquo;Dirty Water Rule.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m not one to read tea leaves of the Supreme Court, overall, the justices seemed disinclined to wholesale reject that &ldquo;wetlands&rdquo; are clearly within the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. The focus of the questioning was around the term &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; as it applied to wetlands, both as it is read in Section 404(g) of the Act (for those wetlands adjacent to traditionally navigable waters) as well as the &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; test (for those wetlands adjacent to other WOTUS, such as tributaries). Questions from multiple justices recognized that &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; does not always require physical touching, nor have the federal agencies ever applied so stringent a limitation in making jurisdictional determinations. Many justices focused on the core purpose of the Clean Water Act - to protect and maintain the water quality of our Nations&rsquo; waters - as perhaps requiring a more inclusive definition than that being proposed by the Sacketts. These lines of questions bode well for the significant nexus test and recognition that physical surface barriers may not cut off CWA jurisdiction for adjacent wetlands.</p>

<p>Where some justices did seem a bit concerned, however, was on the practical implications of applying a jurisdictional test that requires analysis (such as the significant nexus test) and potential impacts to landowners. Worried about whether a landowner might know whether they had a jurisdictional wetland on their property, one line of questioning revolved around the cost of determining jurisdiction that the landowner might have to bear. In response, counsel for the federal government responded that a landowner could ask EPA to make that jurisdictional determination and that they will do it at no cost to the landowner. Counsel went on to explain that, should the landowner wish to challenge that determination, only in the most extreme large-scale development projects &ndash; i.e., not mom-and-pop building their single-family home &ndash; do we see costs for supporting studies reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Another line of questioning tried to imply that since all waters are connected, it would be nearly impossible to know when an impact can be cut off. But again, the response was quick that, as the government has been applying the test since 2006, there must be a &ldquo;significant&rdquo; connection to establish jurisdiction. Yes, sometimes there may be disputes about that but it is not an unworkable standard that must be rejected by the court.</p>

<p>There were many great lines of questions both supporting and questioning the government&rsquo;s position in this case. Yet the reality of how agencies have applied the significant nexus test since 2006 has not borne these concerns out much. So, in light of the seeming support for the federal government&rsquo;s position in this case, I question what impact, if any, might these types of questions have.</p>

<p>There will be much analysis over the next few days on this case, and we won&rsquo;t really know what the justices are thinking until we see the final opinion. But I came away from today&rsquo;s oral arguments (knock on wood) more positive than I thought I would.</p>

<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-27468b99-7fff-eee6-3be8-94fdc32b4a4f""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">WOTUS has been a major issue under the Clean Water Act for my entire legal career (I started law school a few months after </span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Rapanos</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> was decided). Pennsylvania has fairly strong water quality protections with our Clean Streams Law. Still, there are places where a weakened CWA would impact our streams, lakes, and wetlands. I believe in the need &ndash; and the inherent right &ndash; for clean water, and I was encouraged today by the Court&rsquo;s acknowledgment and perhaps even support of the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s stated purpose. After 50 years of the Clean Water Act, I still remain hopeful that we will meet that goal.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Growing Greener Lives On – with Bipartisan Support,8/29/2022,"<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Growing Greener program has a long history of bipartisan support. Now known as the State Parks and Outdoor Recreation Program, Growing Greener reflects the importance of clean streams, open space protections, and robust environmental infrastructure to members of both parties. We are proud to be among the state lawmakers who continue to support this crucial program.</p>

<p>The program&rsquo;s history goes back to 1999. Governor Tom Ridge signed into law legislation creating the first Growing Greener program to benefit various environmental initiatives including parks and recreation, clean water, agricultural improvements and sewer and water projects.&nbsp; This program received large bipartisan support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under Governor Ed Rendell, Growing Greener II became law in 2005. Funded with a bond issuance, Growing Greener II continued many of the same funding streams to benefit watersheds, outdoor recreation and the environment around our Commonwealth. It also received broad bipartisan support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since that time, there has been pent-up demand to enact a Growing Greener III program to provide new funding to these initiatives and to add to environmental investments in our state.&nbsp; The challenge has been finding funding while the Commonwealth has operated under strained budgets over the past decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, with the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a significant stream of federal monies coming to states to address important issues during these challenging times. We introduced Growing Greener III bills in the Senate and the House this session that directed some of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) federal monies to be used to fund this latest update to this successful legacy program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same time, other legislation was introduced in the Senate to provide millions of dollars of ARP funds for a Clean Streams Fund to address agricultural runoff and acid mine drainage.&nbsp; Once again, these bills had broad bipartisan support. The challenge was getting this legislation to the &ldquo;finish line&rdquo; when there were dozens of competing plans to use the limited amount of federal ARP monies.</p>

<p>Soon after introducing Senate Bill 525, we began working with the diverse Growing Greener coalition that had been formed years ago. Among the partners in this group are WeConservePA, Natural Lands, PennFuture, Lancaster Farmland Trust, Sierra Club, Trout Unlimited, and the Foundation for PA Watersheds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, we worked with, and communicated on a regular basis with, DCNR Secretary Cindy Dunn who has been a vocal advocate for new investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, we must acknowledge that the PA Farm Bureau listed these two bills as their top priority when they engaged with all legislators during their advocacy day in Harrisburg in late March.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the assistance of all of these groups and Secretary Dunn, we were able to spread the word to their membership and from their membership to legislators and legislative leaders. As we headed into the serious budget negotiations in June, we could feel the momentum increasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The end result of July&rsquo;s comprehensive budget package &ndash; passed with broad bipartisan support &ndash; was a monumental investment in programs and initiatives to benefit the environment across our Commonwealth:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$100 million in ARP monies for parks and recreation along with $56 million additional from the oil and gas lease funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>$220 million for the Clean Streams Fund to address agricultural run-off and mine drainage, especially in how it affects the Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>$320 million for sewer and water projects to ensure that our communities have access to safe and clean water and that our streams and rivers aren&rsquo;t infected with faulty or outdated systems.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to a concerted and united effort, this entire package was adopted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We look forward to working with all of the coalition groups and supporters of this effort to ensure that these monies are well spent and that our Commonwealth and environment will benefit for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>

I, along with my wonderful colleague Michelle Giles from CVPA, were honored to be selected to be the co-coordinators helping guide along the process from inception to completion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Shared Vision builds upon the great work of the <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Publication-PennFuture-Launches-Green-in-18-Campaign-to-Back-PA-Common-Conservation-Agenda-Developed-by-Statewide-Coalition-of-Environmental-Groups"">&ldquo;Green in &rsquo;18 Common Agenda&rdquo;</a>, a groundbreaking document that represented the first time that the Pennsylvania environmental community came together to list the top environmental issues facing the Commonwealth. This year, we wanted to build upon that great effort and expand it to be more even comprehensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>First and foremost, while the 2018 Common Agenda had an environmental justice section, we purposely decided early on that environmental justice principles and policy solutions should be interwoven throughout the entire document. In order to hold the Steering Committee accountable to this lofty goal, we held meetings with environmental justice groups before, during, and after the drafting of the document to ensure that their concerns and desires were being heard and adequately addressed. We then added two environmental justice members to the Steering Committee, <a href=""https://www.maketheroadpa.org/"">Make the Road PA</a> and <a href=""https://onepa.org/vote/"">OnePA</a>, to ensure that our commitment remained steadfast. These meetings proved to be extremely valuable and helped shape our Shared Vision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their input directly leads to two more concrete changes from the 2018 Common Agenda: expansion on the number of sections and inclusion of personal profiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Shared Vision includes seven intertwining sections: Air, Water, Energy, Housing and Land Use, Labor, Democracy, and Education. We recognized that without protecting labor rights a transition to a green energy future is impossible. That without empowering and protecting our democratic institutions it will be impossible to protect our air &amp; water. And that it is only with quality environmental education for all students, that we can build an understanding and appreciation for how our natural world impacts us among future generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To ensure that these efforts are not mere abstracts, for each of these sections we selected a cross-selection of everyday citizens from throughout the four corners of Pennsylvania to talk about the immediate impact of the policies discussed. We believe that this adds a human touch to the Shared Vision, which reinforces the real-life benefits of our policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recognize that drafting the document is only the first step, and we are now working diligently to see it implemented. We officially launched the Shared Vision this week with a press conference at the Harrisburg Capitol Rotunda. And for the rest of August throughout the state there are events posted that will be open to the public they are:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Southwest Pennsylvania, Thursday, August 11 at 12pm: Hear from community members about how the energy industry has harmed local communities in PA, and policy solutions to reduce pollution and environmental racism before candidates tour the harmful impacts of the energy extraction industry.</li>
	<li>Northeastern Pennsylvania, Sunday, August 14 at 1pm, the Northeastern PA Pan African Coalition hosts their African Festival and graduation event for their Science, Conservation, Health, Engineering, Math, and Art children&rsquo;s program. <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nepa-pan-african-coalition-tickets-393116621397?ms=PF"">RSVP here!</a></li>
	<li>Southeastern Pennsylvania, Monday, August 15 at 6pm: Join the League of Women Voters for a webinar highlighting the intersection between democracy and the environment. <a href=""https://action.conservationpa.org/a/sepa-democracy-and-environment?ms=PF"">SIGN UP</a> &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Lehigh, Thursday, August 18 at 6pm, explore the devastating health consequences of lead in PA&rsquo;s aging homes, and policy solutions to protect children, families, and renters from poisoning, eviction, and displacement with Make the Road Pennsylvania, Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, and the Allentown Environmental Advisory Council at the Mountainville Youth Center in Allentown. <a href=""https://action.conservationpa.org/a/shared-vision-future-pennsylvanias-housing?ms=PF"">SIGN UP&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And we don&rsquo;t intend to stop there. PennFuture and the other co-signers intend to build off our momentum this month, by using use the Shared Vision as a mechanism to educate the candidates seeking an elected position on the state level. After the elections, we intend to use this document as an education tool for incoming lawmakers and for the next gubernatorial administration. Finally, we intend to use this document over the next four years as an accountability tool, to see how much of the Shared Vision has been made reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We at PennFuture are proud of this document and encourage you to read it and share it with your friends, family, and community. Only if we work together, can we make our vision of a just, sustainable Pennsylvania into reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Recent Passage of Lawn Care Bill Will Improve Pennsylvania's Waterways,7/21/2022,"<p>For over a decade clean water advocates have sought updates to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Fertilizer Act to include more protections for waterways. At last, this July we can celebrate the passage of such legislation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>We all have an important role to play when it comes to the health of our rivers and streams. Oftentimes, farmers feel much of the blame falls on them. However, routine lawn care practices can also impact our waterways. When applied in excess, lawn fertilizers can be a significant contributor to poor health of our waterways.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Susquehanna and Potomac river basins alone, roughly the center half of the state, Pennsylvanians apply roughly 22 million pounds of nitrogen <a href=""https://www.chesapeakebay.net/channel_files/37045/sweeney_uswg_turffertilizer_091719.pdf"">in the form of lawn fertilizer every year.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of nitrogen - the most important nutrient for maintaining luscious green turfgrass - flowing into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s streams and rivers. Excess nutrients feed not only grass. It fuels algae growth in our water bodies. When algae eventually dies, the decomposition process sucks oxygen out of the water, making it more difficult - sometimes impossible - for our streams, lakes and rivers to sustain life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excess nutrients are a major cause for one third of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 86,000 miles of streams that are impaired. According to the Department of Environmental Protection, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Updated-Integrated-Water-Quality-Report-Reveals-33-percent-of-Pennsylvania-Waterways-are-Polluted"">more and more waterways are failing to meet water-quality standards.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fertilizers enrich our lawns. But excessive nitrogen and phosphorus application impacts the clean water we need for better health, recreation, and wildlife diversity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excess nutrients can travel across state boundaries to neighboring states, affecting water bodies such as the Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, Ohio River, and Lake Erie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the case of the Chesapeake Bay, the Susquehanna River supplies 55 percent of the Bay&rsquo;s freshwater. Recent studies find it also <a href=""https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pennsylvania-water-science-center/science/pennsylvania-and-chesapeake-bay-watershed"">provides 44 percent of its nitrogen pollution</a>. While not the only culprit, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nitrogen contributions are the highest of all states with water flowing into the Bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a consequence, Pennsylvania is now under a so-called &ldquo;pollution diet,&rdquo; set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Commonwealth is required to reduce the rate of all nitrogen pollution sources <a href=""https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/dep_details.aspx?newsid=1520"">by 32.5 million pounds over the next three years.</a></p>

<p>For too long, improving water quality has been the responsibility of state, county and local governments, with a major burden falling on our agricultural communities. Yet we can only achieve true progress if all Pennsylvanians are engaged, including those of us with the luscious green lawns.</p>

<p>No one expects fertilizer use to stop entirely. Instead, it&rsquo;s time to modernize how fertilizer is regulated and applied in amounts that benefit lawns without causing impact to waterways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last updated in 2001, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Fertilizer Act requires state licenses for manufacturers, sets registration rules for fertilizer products, and establishes minimum labeling standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This July Act 83 of 2022 was signed into law establishing more environmentally beneficial turfgrass-management standards. Limits on nitrogen and phosphorous applications are already adopted by surrounding states.</p>

<p>Act 83 will also help to ensure that anyone - not just farmers - can get involved addressing nitrogen pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are a few best practices you can incorporate into your lawn care routines:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Less is best. Minimize fertilizer applications and never use phosphorus unless for a new lawn or to remedy bare spots.</li>
	<li>Test the soil to know how much, if any, fertilizer is needed.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Avoid applications during winter months or when the ground is frozen.</li>
	<li>Do not apply on impervious surfaces, especially near waterways or anytime when the forecast calls for heavy rain.</li>
	<li>Leave lawn clippings. The cut grass helps shade out weeds and conserve soil moisture.</li>
	<li>Plant native trees and shrubs. Many times native plants require less fertilizer.</li>
</ul>

<p>A well-maintained lawn, with a dense healthy cover of turf grass, can help to manage runoff pollution.</p>

<p>Act 83 will bring Pennsylvania&rsquo;s lawns closer to this ideal, while significantly improving water quality, aligning Pennsylvania&rsquo;s practices with neighboring states, and leveling the playing field by lessening the burden on Pennsylvania farmers.</p>

<p>Tackling excess fertilizer pollution through the measures enacted in Act 83 will go a long way in improving the health of local rivers and streams across the Commonwealth.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Aquashicola Creek Finally Given Exceptional Value Designation,7/7/2022,"<p>After languishing at the Department for Environmental Protection (DEP) for nearly twelve years, the Aquashicola Creek was finally recognized as an Exceptional Value designation in January. This creek, whose upper reaches meander through relatively undeveloped and preserved tracts of land, will now receive the highest level of legal protection provided to waterways in Pennsylvania. For any activity for which the DEP must issue a permit or approval where the creek&#39;s water quality could&nbsp; be affected, the department must ensure, prior to issuing the permit or approval, that the water quality will not be degraded.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a long road for the <a href=""http://www.apwc-pa.com/"">Aquashicola/Pohopoco Watershed Conservancy (APWC)</a>, which has led the charge over the years for the creek&#39;s redesignation. Previously, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission had designated sections of the creek as Class A Wild Trout Stream and Naturally Reproducing Trout Stream. However, APWC&rsquo;s stream redesignation petition provided stream monitoring data and supporting information demonstrating that Aquashicola Creek and its tributaries qualify for the Exceptional Value designation. Exceptional Value streams receive significant regulatory protection from harmful pollution because polluters are required without exception to demonstrate that their discharges into the waterway will not degrade water quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The redesignation process is lengthy and requires collecting petitions, gathering letters, and providing public comments. With the support of local residents, lawmakers, and conservation organizations, the APWC was able to get the existing use of the creek recognized by DEP as&nbsp; Exceptional Value, which ensures protection from its source at Ross Common Creek located in Ross Township to its confluence with the Buckwha Creek in Lower Towamensing Township located in Carbon County. While DEP is still in the process of upgrading the official designated use of the Aquashicola Creek basin, classifying the Exceptional Value existing use ensures the creek will receive the utmost protections. (Learn more about designated and existing uses through this short <a href=""https://youtu.be/DBWr4aFUvgM"">Our Pocono Waters video.)</a></p>

<p>This upper section of the Aquashicola is relatively undeveloped and includes several contiguous preserved tracts of land, like sections of the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge and PA State Game Lands 168. The creek&#39;s course flows parallel to the Appalachian Trail and Kittatinny Ridge, which is a world-famous Migratory Corridor of the Atlantic Flyway, and through wetlands that have special protection under Pennsylvania Code because they are home to threatened and/or endangered species of flora and fauna.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the petition for the redesignation of the Aquashicola stalled at the DEP for over a decade, multiple development projects were proposed in the region that could have directly impacted this pristine creek. Threats posed by development in the Poconos are never-ending. Warehouses and resorts projects <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-True-Cost-of-Convenience-The-Impacts-of-Never-Ending-Warehouse-Development"">continue to appear in front of local planning commissions</a> and zoning boards, and Pennsylvania&#39;s healthiest waters are especially vulnerable to these forms of development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, an upgrade to Exceptional Value protects waterways designated as such, but it requires a great deal of dedication and determination to initiate the redesignation process and to follow it through to completion. The process seems simple on its face - submit a petition to DEP, DEP performs an assessment of the waterway, the stream is often added to a bundle of other streams for consideration, and is moved through the final steps of the regulatory process with the PA Environmental Quality Board (EQB). However, it takes a great deal of time and resources, especially when dealing with an underfunded and overburdened regulatory agency such as DEP who must choose which streams to prioritize across the Commonwealth. PennFuture&#39;s <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PF_StreamHandbook2019_web_2.10.20.pdf"">Stream Redesignation Handbook</a> breaks down the details of the process from start to finish, if you&#39;d like to learn more.</p>

<p>Special protection water quality designations - especially that of Exceptional Value - are incredibly important. Currently, more than thirty percent of Pennsylvania&#39;s creeks and streams are degraded and polluted. Only two percent are so clean and healthy that they are considered Exceptional Value. Eighty percent of those stream miles are found in the Poconos (primarily, Monroe, Wayne, and Pike Counties). Once these streams are degraded, it&#39;s challenging - and sometimes impossible - to rehabilitate them. That&#39;s why this redesignation process is vital to protecting water quality in the Commonwealth. We&#39;ve got to provide the greatest protections possible to these pristine waterways before we lose them.</p>

<p>We know that there are local and regional benefits to special designated creeks and streams. They add to the character and natural beauty of the region, support the local economy, and offer ecological services. For instance, we know that Exceptional Value streams in the Upper and Mid Delaware support $22 million in regional economic activities. We also know that protecting these creeks and streams provides wildlife habitat and mitigates local flooding. And when we expand our view across the Delaware River Basin, we see that the headwaters of the Delaware River provide drinking water for over 13 million people.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pennsylvania has a long history of waterways polluted by heavy industry, agriculture and stormwater runoff, and our dirty water problem is getting worse, not better. That&rsquo;s why it is absolutely critical to celebrate victories like the one we just saw with the Aquashicola Creek, and why it&rsquo;s vital for these Exceptional Value streams to receive the utmost protections from the state.&nbsp;</p>

Pennsylvania Began Participation in RGGI on July 1. What Happens Next?,7/6/2022,"<p><em>(This piece has been updated on July 11, 2022 to reflect recent action at the Commonwealth Court)</em></p>

<p>On July 8, 2022 the Commonwealth Court granted a petition by opponents of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s carbon budget and trade program (often known as the &ldquo;Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Rule&rdquo;) to temporarily halt the implementation and enforcement of the program while it addresses the specific issues that the opponents raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to continuing to defend its rule before the Commonwealth Court, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has appealed the preliminary injunction to the State Supreme Court.&nbsp; As of this writing, we have no indication how long the appeal process will take.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also unclear how this will impact the RGGI program but we explore a bit about RGGI and discuss a few possibilities here.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Background: PA&rsquo;s Participation in RGGI</u></p>

<p>To comply with the RGGI rules, polluting electric generators need to obtain one RGGI allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide they emit each year. Normally these will be purchased at quarterly auctions with the proceeds going to the RGGI state that created the allowance.</p>

<p>Companies aren&rsquo;t limited to buying allowances at auctions. There is also a secondary market as well where participants can buy and sell allowances amongst themselves at any time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The RGGI program also gives companies added flexibility on when to purchase allowances. Compliance is measured over a series of three-year control periods. By the midnight March 1st compliance deadline following the end of each third year, a company must have turned in one allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide they emitted in each of the proceeding three years.</p>

<p>The first two years in each cycle are known as &ldquo;interim control periods.&rdquo; For those years, a company only needs to obtain allowances for 50 percent of their emissions for that year by the compliance deadline. For example, if a company emits 1,000 tons of CO2 per year, they need to turn in 500 allowances after the first year, another 500 allowances after the second year, and then the remaining 2,000 allowances by the end of the third year.</p>

<p>Because Pennsylvania wasn&rsquo;t participating in RGGI until after the start of 2022, companies only need to count their emissions between July 1 and December 31 toward their compliance obligation this year.&nbsp; Since 2022 is the second interim control period of RGGI&rsquo;s fifth three-year (2021 &ndash; 2023) control period, companies will need to obtain allowances for 50 percent of those emission by midnight of March 1, 2023.</p>

<p>Companies have two opportunities to do so. The non-profit organization, RGGI Inc., that manages the auctions is expected to hold allowance auctions on September 7th and December 7th. Between these two auctions, Pennsylvania is expected to make a little over 40 million allowances available for sale alongside the allowances from other participating states. (Because this is a regional program, companies can buy allowances from any participating state.)</p>

<p><u>Effects of Ongoing Legal Challenges</u></p>

<p>One issue unique to Pennsylvania is that there are two separate ongoing legal challenges. The first case was brought by Republican legislators who are opposed to RGGI but couldn&rsquo;t secure enough votes in the General Assembly to block the program. The second case was brought by some of the companies that are opposed to RGGI, alongside trade organizations like the PA Coal Alliance and other opponents. In both cases they asked the Commonwealth Court for a preliminary injunction&mdash;basically, an order from the court that tells the DEP to freeze the implementation of the rule in some way while the court decides the case on the merits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get a preliminary injunction, the requester must convince a court that some &ldquo;immediate and irreparable&rdquo; harm will occur to them unless it is granted and that the party requesting the injunction is likely to prevail on the merits when all is said and done. The industry claimed they will suffer this kind of harm&mdash;even though the compliance deadline isn&rsquo;t until next year.&nbsp; The Commonwealth Court sided with the industry on this point and discounted the harm to public health and welfare in terms of air quality, climate change, and other environmental impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While we disagree with this decision, we are now faced with assessing the damage that even a temporary injunction might cause.&nbsp; That is going to depend on a number of factors.</p>

<p><u>How long?&nbsp;</u></p>

<p>How long such an injunction would last is a difficult question and that will depend, at least in part, on how the case proceeds. It could only last a matter of days or weeks if the Supreme Court acts quickly and sides with the DEP on its appeal. If, on the other hand, an injunction remains in effect until the courts decide the lawsuits on the merits (including appeals), it could take from months to the better part of a year to ultimately resolve.</p>

<p><u>What about the current quarter, since Pennsylvania already became a participating state in RGGI?</u></p>

<p>If there is a very short injunction, it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily prevent Pennsylvania participating in the September auction and, almost certainly, wouldn&rsquo;t impact the December auction. If that happens, you might wonder how the injunction impacts the various companies&rsquo; compliance obligations. Does the pollution they emitted during the injunction still &ldquo;count&rdquo;, or are they allowed to pollute for free? Here, the answer is going to depend on the gritty details of what the court decides. Companies need to track their CO2 emissions anyway, so continuing to do so is hardly a burden and there is plenty of time to resolve any questions before the compliance deadline, but every day that pollution doesn&rsquo;t count towards the allowance requirement puts more money in the pockets of polluters.</p>

<p>Assuming the pollution emitted during an injunction still counts, it would still be better to resolve the case in time for PA to participate in the September auction. The cloud of indecisions could easily impact the behavior of potential buyers and, ultimately, depress the &ldquo;clearing price&rdquo; of the auction, meaning the end of day dollar amount that the RGGI allowances are worth. If the allowances sell for less, that directly translates into smaller proceeds that Pennsylvania can invest in reducing air pollution, we as Pennsylvanians who want clean air have a strong interest in avoiding that scenario.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Holding the December auction is likely more critical. If we lose the opportunity to sell allowances in 2022 we could, possibly, roll them forward into 2023 auctions, but the next one won&rsquo;t be until after the March 1st compliance deadline. It&rsquo;s hard to say how that situation would be resolved, but polluters will almost assuredly try and avoid their compliance obligation entirely.</p>

<p><u>What&#39;s Next?</u></p>

<p>As we said in the beginning, there is no way yet to know what the exact outcome will be until we see the judge&rsquo;s order and reasoning, which we expect soon. Whichever way the court holds, it&rsquo;s clear that there could be huge impacts to the Clean Air Fund. PennFuture will be watching and stands ready to update you on whatever will come next.</p>

We Must Continue to Work for Change,7/5/2022,"<p>Standing on the doorstep to my retirement, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-President-and-CEO-Jacquelyn-Bonomo-Announces-Retirement"">announced in February</a>, the last few months have included a lot of reminiscing, reflecting and taking stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been wonderful to hear from so many dear friends and former colleagues whom I&rsquo;ve worked with across the country.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been so generous with well-wishes and advice about retirement.&nbsp; Those working in our movement &mdash; the protection of our planet, its environment, and all that inhabit it &mdash;&nbsp; are in pursuit of a &ldquo;greater good&rdquo; and come to our work and mission through a profession, an avocation, a passion, a personal imperative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mission binds us, and for me, has been a nearly unmatched priority in my life.&nbsp;The opportunity to have done this work has been beyond satisfying, both a privilege and a challenge, and has given me an eco-family, in addition to my birth family.</p>

<p>There have been a small handful of people who have hired me along the way, mentored me, supervised me, just given me a chance, so thank you very, very much. And thank you to the folks that have worked &ldquo;for&rdquo; me and always so brilliantly.</p>

<p>As I step away, in this moment, we all have grave concerns.&nbsp;Our democracy, our climate, our freedoms, and future generations are grievously threatened.&nbsp;The environmental movement is realizing intersectionality with other movements.&nbsp;In my opinion, the commonalities that are bringing us together are somewhat tenuous.&nbsp;So what binds us needs to be elevated beyond the matters (racism, ageism, classism, political affiliations, city folk or country folk to name a few) that can pull us back into our separate corners. We need to seek out any and all like-minded entities with whom to work, to build power that can outlast the storms that have always been on the horizon, but that are here now and that cannot be under-estimated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here at PennFuture, we&rsquo;ve taken important steps to bridge divides.&nbsp;We created new programs around civic participation and democracy, in part to open our organization to issues of concern to communities of color.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve really ramped up our presence in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s mid-sized towns and communities &ndash; such as Erie, the Lehigh Valley, and the Pocono northeast.&nbsp; And we are working hard to raise funds to have more of a presence in the north-central heartland counties.&nbsp;These places are strategic to power building, to fight statewide threats that emanate from the underserved and forgotten communities in these locales, and to put us into closer contact with people who can help us figure out how PennFuture can be successful with our work in such a divided state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The organization I leave is healthy, and stable, and in the stewardship of very competent and committed individuals.&nbsp;2022 will be an important one for our state, particularly as we approach the fall general elections.&nbsp;After that, we&rsquo;ll know where things stand and this knowledge will enable PennFuture, and our strategic partner Conservation Voters of PA, to build their next strategic plan to address those realities, and threats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I take great pride in the work PennFuture has done since I came here in 2015.&nbsp;Our thought leadership has been elevated. Our work on greener economic development has made its way into state and federal policy.&nbsp; We are positioned to offer expertise on emerging threats to our climate &ndash; the fossil fuel dimensions of bitcoin mining, new hydrogen hubs, refineries, plastics and petrochemical facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A space I have always been personally comfortable in has been in advocacy, and like me, PennFuture has been plain in using our voice and influence to fight against industry&rsquo;s influence on our legislature and our communities.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not just in sports where &ldquo;defense&rdquo; is the headline.&nbsp;So it has been with PennFuture&rsquo;s essential work to fight the onslaught of bad policies, bad proposals, and bad projects &mdash;&nbsp; the vast majority to favor fracked gas and other fossil fuels &mdash;&nbsp; that just keep coming.&nbsp;Our legal team has elevated its game in response to these threats, and in addition to just fighting hard, is always looking to test ideas and strategies that protect forgotten communities and places against environmental harms.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve won in the courts.&nbsp;We are moving Pennsylvania forward in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), PennFuture&rsquo;s climate priority since October 2019.&nbsp;And this summer, in the midst of the budget, we are seeing good possibilities for much-needed environmental funding <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/state-officials-advocates-ask-legislature-to-fund-waterway-protection-five-for-the-weekend/"">to be realized because of bi-partisan work in&nbsp;the legislature.</a>&nbsp;If this does happen, it will be a cause for celebration, not just for the green economy sectors (agriculture, outdoor recreation and tourism), and land and waters that will benefit, but for the outcome of having all political parties&rsquo; support for our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve reflected on in these past months, has been the coalition of groups that helped many years ago to &ldquo;stop&rdquo; the damming of Nescopeck Creek, sort of my conservation origin story.&nbsp; Involved were people of all political persuasions; there were scientists, hunters, and anglers and Sierra Clubbers, and many more involved.&nbsp; Pennsylvania has a rich natural heritage that for decades was embraced by all.&nbsp; We must return to that place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That day in 1984 when I made a promise to myself to fight the damming of that free-flowing stream, I did what it took to put that promise into action, and organized, and fought, and won.&nbsp; We must be willing to carry on the fight when necessary, to build bridges where we can and until we change hearts and minds, and our state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, for the many, many years that I had the privilege to be in this field, I came to work every day and tried to make something happen, tried to create change.&nbsp; Between the fights, some losses, and wins, I never lost hope that change is possible. This work is a long-term proposition.&nbsp; I feel blessed to help carry the green flame for four decades; and pass it onto others who I know will pursue it with fight, endurance, and hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Philly Tree Fund Bill A Significant Step in Protection of Tree Canopy,6/29/2022,"<p>Philadelphia passed Councilmember Katherine Gilmore Richardson’s Philly Tree Fund bill during a marathon session last week. The bill helps Philadelphia take a significant step in the protection of its tree canopy and more equally distribute its benefits. </p>

<p>This legislation was an effort to implement ideas from the recent draft of the <a href=""https://sites.google.com/hinge-collective.com/philly-tree-plan"">Philly Tree Plan</a>, Philadelphia’s first long-term urban forest planning initiative, which is expected to be finalized in the coming months. </p>

<p>Philadelphia’s black and brown communities continue to experience disproportionate effects of environmental and health hazards, hazards that threaten to worsen as climate change advances. Among these are dealing with extreme urban heat. The city’s Office of Sustainability, for instance, has found more than a 22-degree temperature difference between some underserved communities and wealthier neighboring communities in 2015. Trees have a significant role in these temperature differences. </p>

<p>Among the more understated values of trees is their shading, which reduces the amount of sunlight hitting pavements and buildings, cooling the surrounding area. Trees also do the same through transpiration, cooling the air as liquid water from the trees’ leaves evaporates into gas. It is significant then, that according to the Tree Plan, Philadelphia lost 6% in tree cover between 2008 and 2018. Also of the over <a href=""https://treephilly.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tree-Canopy-Assessment-Report-Philadelphia-2018.pdf"">a thousand acres of tree canopy</a> that were removed, most were from residential areas exacerbating environmental and health disparities between communities.</p>

<p>Making matters more challenging are the issues that exist in zoning regulations and the zoning process. Regulations designed to protect tree cover require developers to replace certain trees. However, existing policies <a href=""https://gridphilly.com/blog-home/2022/4/29/tree-laws-in-philadelphia-have-loopholes-big-enough-to-drive-a-logging-truck-through/"">exempt trees</a> growing in parks or on single or two-family lots, despite both contributing to much of Philadelphia’s existing tree canopy. </p>

<p>The Department of Licenses and Inspections is also in need of more support. In addition to a host of responsibilities that include ensuring the safety of demolition and construction activities, inspectors are also tasked with interpreting and enforcing tree regulations despite most <a href=""https://gridphilly.com/blog-home/2022/5/11/councilmember-katherine-gilmore-richardson-moves-to-close-tree-protection-loopholes/"">not having expertise in the area</a>. This, as one might suspect, makes enforcement of tree violations that much more inconsistent contributing, at least in part, to declining tree cover. </p>

<p>Councilmember Gilmore Richardson’s legislation seeks to reverse this decline all the while advancing environmental justice efforts and tightening up regulations. </p>

<p>On the whole, the bill focuses on increasing tree preservation and planting requirements and does so through different means. For one, it removes the exemption from parks and open spaces, requiring developers to replace trees that were cut down in future related projects. It also does the same for single or two-family lots that are greater than 5000 square feet. The same also applies to planting in drive-thrus and parking lots <a href=""https://www.phillyvoice.com/tree-canopy-decline-city-council-plantings-philadelphia-philly-tree-fund/"">with provisions in place</a> for areas that cannot add trees. This tightening of exemptions will further contribute to tree planting efforts. </p>

<p>There is also a tree fund created that is sourced from fees on developers who do not replace trees that were cut down. The funds will be used to plant trees elsewhere.</p>

<p>The bill also increases planting in residential areas and grants credits for preserving existing trees towards trees required by the Zoning Code. One of the forms this takes is in the requirement for some development projects to plant yard trees. It also calls for tree plantings in lots near select boulevards, expressways, and roads. </p>

<p>Again, the creation of this fund and increasing planting requirements and preservation incentives are impactful in helping get Philadelphia back on track towards its goal of achieving <a href=""https://treephilly.org/about/"">a 30% tree canopy by 2030.</a> </p>

<p>Stormwater runoff remains an issue in Philadelphia. During rain events, water runs off and flows into sewer systems, which can overwhelm rivers and pollute with things like fertilizer, oil, and other sediments. In certain instances, runoff is also capable of flooding homes and businesses. Managing it is essential and green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is a sustainable means. Buffers are an example of GSI and are a prominent focus of the proposed legislation.</p>

<p>The bill requires vegetative buffers near highways and industrial sites among others. These buffers would provide areas where stormwater can penetrate the soil and replenish groundwater reserves, slowing the runoff rate and protecting the neighboring areas' water quality. It also clarifies the requirements for tree buffers. More efficient tree buffer systems better provide shade and enhance the cooling effects of transpiration, helping decrease temperatures for areas. Additional protections are also put in place for heritage trees.</p>

<p>The bill covers several of the recommendations from the Philly Tree Plan. The most notable of these was the creation of a tree fund sourced from fees for the non-compliance of developers in planting a certain amount of trees, much like the one found in Councilmember Gilmore Richardson’s bill. It also addressed calls for greater involvement of local communities in the form of a notification process for tree clearings. </p>

<p>The bill did however see amendments added to it in order to secure its passing. Other than areas where the technical language was made more specific, this included exempting land under the Philadelphia Authority For Industrial Development from certain rules, in particular those regarding the preservation of heritage trees.</p>

<p>An amendment exempting affordable housing projects from the requirements of the bill raised concerns for multiple testifiers during a previous hearing before City Council’s Rules Committee. PennFuture shares these concerns as low-income residents often suffer from the most severe lack of tree canopy and the related benefits. It was also disappointing to see that the 5th Councilmanic District was also exempted from the requirements of the bill as efforts to build our canopy will require a citywide effort and should, ultimately, be governed by uniform standards. </p>

<p>Despite its significant advances toward realizing the ever-important vision of the Tree Plan and restoring Philadelphia’s tree canopy, there is still much work to be done in that regard. </p>

<p>One of the areas that future legislation can pursue is the creation of a new office within the city’s existing Parks and Recreation Department. The Tree Plan refers to such an office as the Office of the City Forester and its function would be to oversee tree-related regulations. This can be one of the most beneficial steps in advancing Philadelphia’s tree efforts, helping improve the coordination of all tree-related activities, programs, and planning. </p>

<p>Further, also in line with the Tree Plan’s aims to invest in the people and communities as part of the tree effort, existing programs that communities trust to support tree planting and tree care should receive greater funding. One of these organizations is PowerCorpsPHL, a workforce development program that focuses on environmental service. PowerCorpsPHL is responsible <a href=""https://powercorpsphl.org/"">for planting 8800 trees</a> in Philadelphia since its recent conception. Greater funding would help programs such as this do more for trees, while also helping citizens acquire careers in the process. </p>

<p>More significant financial incentives for private landowners are also a viable option to pursue. More free tree seedlings could be provided to homeowners in addition to greater public education efforts around urban trees. This could also take the form of more substantial grants, tax rebates, and consulting services.<a href=""https://medium.com/climate-conscious/how-cities-can-protect-trees-on-private-land-7a4184644f29""> In Hawaii</a>, owners of certain valued trees for instance can claim a tax deduction of $3,000 every three years for maintenance costs. </p>

<p>The bill is a vital first step in realizing the significant environmental and socio-economic benefits trees can have on Philadelphia and can be the foundation from which these benefits manifest for all. <br />

PennFuture Protects Major River Basins Across Pennsylvania in Stormwater Settlement,6/27/2022,"<p>On Tuesday, June 21, 2022, PennFuture successfully reached an agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), PennDOT, and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) in its lawsuit seeking stronger protections from stormwater runoff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A bit of background: When there are storms, the ground can become saturated, and&nbsp;excess water flows across the surface and into rivers, lakes, and streams. As it moves along, it picks up whatever dirt, trash, oil, dust, and anything else that is sitting on the ground surface. The water that runs off&nbsp; hard, impervious surfaces, such as roads, can become especially polluted, because of the oil and exhaust solids that cars and trucks give off. The big three pollutants from this &ldquo;stormwater runoff&rdquo; are <a href=""https://extension.psu.edu/what-is-sediment-and-why-is-it-a-stormwater-pollutant"">sediment</a> (mainly fine dirt and dust), <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/issue"">nitrogen, and phosphorus</a>. All runoff water eventually flows into our streams, rivers, and lakes, and collects, building up and leading to toxic algae blooms, cloudy, cloudy water that can&rsquo;t support aquatic life, and water we can&rsquo;t use for fishing or any other enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, under the federal Clean Water Act, municipalities and public (or quasi-public) entities, such as PennDOT and the PTC, are required to take action to control their stormwater runoff. Exactly what action they have to take is controlled by their stormwater permits, which are issued every 5 years by DEP. There are two kinds: first, there is a so-called &ldquo;general&rdquo; permit, which has more generally applicable terms and has a straightforward application process; second, a town or entity has the option to apply for an &ldquo;individual&rdquo; permit, which has terms that are more tailored to their own individual needs and business conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the fall of 2021, DEP issued an individual permit each to PennDOT and PTC, and PennFuture noticed those permits were seriously flawed for two big reasons. First, we believed the permits allowed PennDOT and PTC to have much more lenient standards than other municipalities or comparable entities. Second, on top of that, the permits let both PennDOT and PTC &ldquo;trade&rdquo; their pollution reduction across different major watersheds &ndash; Ohio River, Lake Erie, and Delaware River. This meant that not only were they being held to lower standards in the first place, but it was possible to lower the standards even further, and favor one watershed over another so that some watersheds might not have as much water quality protection as other watersheds in the Commonwealth. Now is not the time to walk back water protections for anyone, and PennFuture was willing to wade into these turbulent legal waters to be hold DEP accountable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture believes that all watersheds in Pennsylvania should be protected, and that all entities should be tasked with protecting our waters equally. It simply defies logic to allow someone to treat several different watersheds as one single one: if that were true, then they wouldn&rsquo;t be separate watersheds! Each river, and the people who use it, deserve the same protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through our litigation against DEP, PennDOT, and PTC, PennFuture is pleased with the final settlement that has been reached: PennDOT and PTC will not be able to do any interbasin trading for their pollution reduction; each watershed at issue must reach the same level of stormwater pollution reduction. While the overall pollution reduction amounts remain the same, PennFuture believes that our lawsuit has sent a strong signal that there are watchdogs looking out for clean water and the highest standards. We will continue to watchdog when the specifics of the pollution reduction plans are released later this year to ensure that these plans are protective of water quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bottom line: As a result of PennFuture&rsquo;s close watchdogging and resulting litigation, PennDOT and PTC will now be required to protect each of the watersheds they are in equally, and we expect that there will be significant reductions in stormwater pollution as a result.&nbsp;</p>

Turning PA into a “Hydrogen Hub” is not a Sustainable Energy Solution,6/24/2022,"<p>Discussions around beginning a massive-scale Blue Hydrogen project in Pennsylvania began hitting the media around August of 2021, where fossil fuel industry leader Perry Babb announced the launch of <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2021/08/15/A-laboratory-at-scale-a-hydrogen-carbon-storage-shale-drilling-and-urea-project-has-hit-the-industry-zeitgeist-at-just-the-right-time/stories/202108080048%E2%80%8B"">a $410 million project called KeyState to Zero in Clinton County</a>, north-central Pennsylvania. This effort was part of a larger push by a mixture of government and private entities to pursue hydrogen as an alleged means to achieve net zero carbon emissions. I also wrote a blog on <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Pennsylvania-as-a-Hydrogen-Hub"">Pennsylvania becoming a &ldquo;Hydrogen Hub&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;in September of 2021. In October of 2021, PennFuture&rsquo;s Rob Altenburg joined the Ohio River Valley Institute for a webinar on the emergence of hydrogen (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmNZveWOSCM&amp;t=812s"">archived here</a>), and subsequently published a blog <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Basics-of-Hydrogen"">discussing the basics of Hydrogen.</a></p>

<p>Since then, attention around hydrogen has only grown, especially in the eyes of federal and state government leadership. In May of this year, Governor Wolf <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2022/05/16/pennsylvania-gov-tom-wolf-hydrogen-carbon-sequestration-storage-hub-climate-energy-southwestern-natural-gas-shell-cracker-petrochemical-plant-beaver/stories/202205160087"">announced his full endorsement</a> of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (&ldquo;CCS&rdquo;). CCS is a process <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/2287551-inside-the-race-to-scale-up-co2-capture-technology-and-hit-net-zero/"">that captures some carbon dioxide emissions</a> from sources (like coal-fired power plants) and either reuses or stores it so it will not enter the atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically, the Governor and state agencies such as the Department of Community and Economic Development, announced their intention to take advantage of an $8 billion federally-funded project (which is part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed last year) spearheaded by the United States Department of Energy that calls for at least four hydrogen hubs across the country. Fossil fuel companies such as Shell, Equinor, EQT, and about a dozen others have joined in and have been making the pitch for a public-private partnership to advance this project. PennFuture <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Responds-to-Gov-Wolfs-Hydrogen-Hub-Announcement-on-May-16"">swiftly spoke out</a> against the Governor and others&rsquo; move to support this project without fully evaluating the environmental and human dangers it presents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I wrote about last year, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Its-Past-Time-for-Pennsylvania-to-Invest-in-Renewable-Energy"">Pennsylvania must develop and support truly renewable energy projects:&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Instead of doubling down on an unsustainable and dirty fracked gas industry, Pennsylvania must work to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote alternatives such as energy efficiency and clean renewable energy. To do so, we must align our investments with our goals and avoid unintended side effects that promote pollution and poison our communities and our workers.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>We recognized then that this &ldquo;hydrogen hub&rdquo; pitch is merely another fracked gas industry scheme to keep itself alive for a bit longer while falsely presenting this project as a wholesale &ldquo;clean energy solution.&nbsp;Hydrogen development is not the sustainable energy solution it is currently being billed as for Pennsylvania and its future.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>PennFuture&rsquo;s New Report on Hydrogen</u></p>

<p>PennFuture has recently published a paper entitled <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PennFuture-Hydrogen-Position-Paper-Final-%28June-2022%29.pdf"">&ldquo;Hydrogen in Pennsylvania: An Opportunity to Do It Right.&rdquo;</a> In this paper, we went into detail about the risks of blue and gray hydrogen as well as CCS. We recognize that Pennsylvania needs a state net-zero plan that truly sets the Commonwealth on a path to transitioning from fossil fuel power to clean energy, prioritizing and supporting more energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, as well as targeted, niche technologies like CCS and green hydrogen. We need a real climate protection policy that limits carbon and methane pollution and drives investments in clean energy and efficiency as quickly as possible. Hydrogen and CCS may be useful tools in limited situations, but they are not the climate solution on their own.</p>

<p><u>What is Hydrogen?</u></p>

<p>Hydrogen is being proposed as a &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; alternative to methane (e.g., fracked gas). However, hydrogen exists in various forms.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a renewable, zero-carbon energy source is used, such as hydrolysis, the result is clean <span style=""color:#008000;"">&ldquo;green&rdquo;</span> hydrogen.</li>
	<li>Hydrogen derived from fracked gas and other fossil fuels is known as <span style=""color:#808080;"">&ldquo;gray&rdquo;</span> hydrogen and accounts for 95 percent of U.S. production. This steam reformation process requires combustion of fracked gas which produces carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, both climate-impacting gasses. This is what is being proposed by the &ldquo;hydrogen hub&rdquo; proponents.</li>
	<li><span style=""color:#0000FF;"">&ldquo;Blue&rdquo;</span> hydrogen is cultivated through the use of CCS technology. However, CCS <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blue-Hydrogen-Presentation_February-2022.pdf"">has not proven itself economically feasible</a> in large-scale installations and limitations of capture efficiency along with other fugitive emissions means methane gas will still be released.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>So rather than rely on complicated color codes, we focus on the end results: hydrogen is either produced with zero carbon, or it is polluting.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>PennFuture&rsquo;s Positions</u></p>

<p>PennFuture recognizes that clean hydrogen may be a useful technology toward meeting the climate goals of net-zero by 2050, but it can only be supported, subject to the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Renewable energy now. Pursuing the myth that fracked gas could be a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; to a clean energy economy has already wasted more time than we could afford to waste. Development and investment in renewable energy must be a number one priority.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Limited uses. We must think of hydrogen not as a fuel, but as one of many potential energy storage mechanisms. If industries can use true clean renewable energy directly, they should.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Stringent public health and environmental safety practices and regulations. We must ensure strong protections for our workers, local communities, and environment and must not allow new development to increase burdens&mdash;particularly on environmental justice communities.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on these positions, PennFuture cannot support the proposed dirty hydrogen facilities (including the regional hydrogen hubs), sought after by the fracking and petrochemical industry and Governor Tom Wolf. We must prioritize our limited resources on renewable energy technology development and support clean, renewable energy projects in Pennsylvania now.</p>

<p><u>Policy Recommendations</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pennsylvania needs to develop a cohesive, statewide net-zero energy policy that provides a true pathway to modernizing the state energy system.</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania must stop advancing subsidies for fracked gas, petrochemicals, and other fracked gas-dependent technologies; and Pennsylvania should begin ratcheting down its centuries-long taxpayer support for fossil fuels.</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania must facilitate and support the development of truly renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and in some cases, green hydrogen.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania must ensure that environmental justice is at the forefront of any projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pennsylvania is at a crossroads between the dirty energy past and a green energy future, and yet our leaders continue to look backwards. Embracing false solutions like &ldquo;Hydrogen Hubs&rdquo; will cost Pennsylvanians their health, lives, and millions of dollars in lost job opportunities by not investing state resources towards building out a robust renewable energy infrastructure while the industry is beginning to expand worldwide.</p>

"New Plastic Bag Ban Bill in Philadelphia Could Result in Cleaner, Greener Future",6/21/2022,"<p>Philadelphia&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to address the plastic waste crisis are poised to make significant advances following City Council&rsquo;s summer recess. This advance is in the form of the potential passing of a new bill under Councilmember Mark Squilla that aims to further address plastic bag use and limit its subsequent harmful impacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to Philadelphia&rsquo;s original ban on single-use plastic bags, estimates showed that the city used well over one billion plastic bags a year, which littered our&nbsp; streets and clogged our waterways. For water, in particular, the environmental and human impacts are rather significant. Plastic degrades into microplastics in water, something that <a href=""https://pennenvironment.org/reports/pac/microplastics-pennsylvania"">recent reports from PennEnvironment confirm</a> is in 100% of the state water samples they collected. These microplastics are&nbsp; not just ingested by the environment and its wildlife but also by people, in addition to the toxic chemicals often found with these plastics such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, combining to have serious <a href=""https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Plastic-and-Health-The-Hidden-Costs-of-a-Plastic-Planet-February-2019.pdf"">long-term human health impacts.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Plastic bags also clog Philadelphia&rsquo;s recycling facilities, with officials <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/phillys-plastic-bag-ban-is-finally-here-with-enforcement-still-to-come/"">estimating 10,000 hours</a> being spent just untangling bags from equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For these reasons, efforts to reduce&nbsp; plastic bag usage have been in motion for several years. It began first in 2007 when&nbsp;Council tried to ban plastic bag usage outright. Then-councilmembers Jim Kenney and Frank DiCicco led the charge <a href=""https://billypenn.com/2019/02/25/after-a-decade-of-strikeouts-philly-might-actually-ban-plastic-bags/"">with the support of four others</a>. However, lobbying efforts from grocers and petrochemical actors were too potent for the bill to hold ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The same contingent attempted <a href=""https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philadelphia-plastic-bag-ban-trashed/1884469/"">to do the same in 2009</a>, but again to no avail and for similar reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2012, media organization Green Philly attempted to revive these conversations, leading a petition to ban disposable bags <a href=""https://billypenn.com/2019/02/25/after-a-decade-of-strikeouts-philly-might-actually-ban-plastic-bags/"">which received over 1,300 signatures</a>, and started <a href=""https://billypenn.com/2019/02/25/after-a-decade-of-strikeouts-philly-might-actually-ban-plastic-bags/"">a Facebook page</a> to document the littering of plastic bags across Philadelphia. Though an admirable effort that highlighted the popular sentiment in favor of reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, it was not enough for Council to take action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would not be until 2015 that momentum for this cause would increase in earnest. Councilmember Squilla took up this environmental initiative and proposed that <a href=""https://billypenn.com/2019/02/25/after-a-decade-of-strikeouts-philly-might-actually-ban-plastic-bags/"">a five-cent fee be attached</a> to the bags. It would charge the fee to those using a single-use bag from retail establishments and it would be imposed on both plastic and paper bags. Despite having support from a broad-based coalition of environmental and community groups, the bill again fell through.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/state/wolf-plastic-bags-environment-jobs-veto-20170701.html"">In 2017</a>, the Pennsylvania General Assembly attempted to subvert local authority and secure the interests of the petrochemical industries through preemption. A bill managed to pass that would have not allowed municipalities from issuing a plastic bag ban in the first place, something that would go on to be vetoed by Governor Tom Wolf. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Plastics-Problem-More-False-Strategies-Statewide-Preemption"">Again in 2019</a>, the General Assembly maneuvered to sneak a ban into that year&rsquo;s state budget proposal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Philadelphia sued the State in response and the budget laws banning local governments from implementing plastic-bag bans have since expired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would not be until 2019 that a ban on single-use bags would be implemented in Philadelphia. While environmental advocates were enthused about the direction&nbsp;Council was headed with such a bill, there was a recognition that the ban did not go far enough. The biggest concern&nbsp;was the lack of a fee structure. The original bill had a provision for a ban on all single-use plastic bags and a 15-cent fee for others but a compromise was made to remove the fee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hybrid structures for bag bans, those with bans and fee components, are found to be the most effective approach in this regard, something that the new bill calls for. It concentrates costs to consumers of plastic bags. Fees for plastic bags labeled as free are in fact not. Instead, the price is passed off overhead of the retailer that is passed onto customers in the price of goods purchased. The 15-cent fee component of this new bill would make sure that this cost is attributed to just those who consume these bags, while fees on recyclable paper and reusable bags would encourage customers to bring their own bags.</p>

<p>This approach would also discourage shoppers from just switching from plastic to paper and encourage the use of reusable carryout bags instead. Studies have supported this. One looked at the response to Washington DC&rsquo;s law applying a five-cent bag fee. It found that after the implementation of the five-cent bag fee, plastic bag use declined <a href=""https://doee.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ddoe/publication/attachments/DDOE%202013%20Bag%20Law%20Survey%20Final%20Report%20(2).pdf"">by over 60 percent.</a> Much of the same success could be experienced in Philadelphia if the new bill is passed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The current structure of ban and no fee also runs the risk of increasing plastic and other resource consumption. With no fee disincentive, customers often take whatever alternatives are still available for free. As a result, as consumption of thin single-use plastic bags decreases, consumption of the remaining free paper and thicker plastic bags often increase. Under the 2019 bill, &ldquo;reusable&rdquo; bags thicker than 2.25 mils and paper bags become the &ldquo;free&rdquo; alternatives. Studies have proven this. One that examined the <a href=""https://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Bag_Tax_Paper_final.pdf"">carryout bag use in Chicago supermarkets</a> before and after the implementation of a fee showed substantial decreases in single-use bag usage and increases in customers bringing their own bags or no bags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These options, however, are more expensive for the grocer. As a result, this increase in cost is incorporated into retailer&rsquo;s overhead and has more consequential environmental impacts. Thicker plastic bags are heavier to transport, consume higher amounts of fossil fuels and require higher levels of ethylene to produce into plastics. These all serve to increase Philadelphia&rsquo;s overall climate emissions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paper bags, on the other hand, have their own set of harmful environmental impacts. The paper-making process uses a lot of energy and can be a major source of water pollution. Transportation emissions are also a concern here. The new bill would help curb these consumer and environmental harms.</p>

<p>Concerns over the additive cost to lower-income residents can also be addressed with this new rendition of the bill. This could be in the form of greater outreach and reusable giveaway efforts towards these lower-income communities and exemptions from fees for those residents that are SNAP/WIP participants.</p>

<p>The time for action is now. While the plastic bag ban bill in 2019 put Philadelphia on the right course to address plastic pollution, it does not do enough. The new plastic ban bill can right the ship and steer Philadelphia into a more equitable, cleaner, and greener future.&nbsp;</p>

"PennFuture, Partners Advocate for Clean Water Funding Opportunities in the State Budget",6/15/2022,"<p>It&rsquo;s budget season in Harrisburg!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has $2.2 billion in federal American Rescue Plan funding that remains unallocated out of $7 billion it originally received. Recognizing the importance of natural infrastructure and healthy rivers and streams to public health, this money should be used to fund clean water programs and practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are two proposals being debated in Harrisburg that would direct $750 million to conservation, clean water, and open space protection.</p>

<p>The first bill, called SB 525 in the Senate and HB 2020 in the House, would reinvigorate a popular conservation program created under former Gov. Tom Ridge two decades ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically, the Growing Greener program provides critical support to community-driven work that improves and protects our cities and towns. Since 1999, Growing Greener has been a lifeline to conservation and clean water projects across the state. These investments bring lasting benefits to communities across Pennsylvania from clean water to open spaces to recreational pursuits for Pennsylvanians and tourists alike.</p>

<p>The second bill, called SB 832 in the Senate and HB 1901 in the House, would create a new Clean Streams Fund to tackle water pollution from nonpoint sources such as agriculture runoff and drainage from abandoned mines. Specifically, this new Fund would establish new programs and give a boost to existing programs. It would create the Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program to help farmers and the Municipal Stormwater Assistance Program to provide funding to local governments to manage stormwater.</p>

<p>On June 8th, PennFuture led a bipartisan effort in the Capitol Rotunda to call on lawmakers to support clean water funding in this year&rsquo;s budget, which must be passed by June 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically, PennFuture and 25 partner co-sponsors - along with Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn, Sen. Carolyn Comitta, Rep. Lynda Culver, and the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau - held a press conference in Harrisburg in support of the Growing Greener III program and the Clean Streams Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Subsurface Storage is a Promising Addition to our Renewable Energy Arsenal,6/14/2022,"<p>Batteries, storage, renewables: you&rsquo;ve probably heard these terms a lot alongside each other when the topic of clean energy comes up. One of the true barriers facing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s transition to a clean energy future is the need for a balanced grid and for on-demand power. We know this to be true, which is why we&rsquo;re excited to talk about some of the new technology that is being developed with help from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s own brain trust that can help advance a cleaner future and environment in Pennsylvania and across the nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the past several weeks, PennFuture has been researching and interviewing entities and individuals working on bringing a new technology that uses the principles of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower"">Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH)</a> to communities across the United States. The idea behind PSH as it relates to renewable energy is simple: when demand is high, the grid simply draws energy directly from renewable sources. As demand drops, that clean energy is still being generated, but the excess is then used to pump water between two reservoirs at different elevations. When demand goes back up, the water is released, and its energy is captured and used by consumers on the grid. PSH is often considered the gold standard for energy storage because of its efficiency and ease of use. In fact, PSH <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/how-pumped-storage-hydropower-works"">currently accounts for 95% of all utility-scale energy storage capacity in the country.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PSH plants operate much like conventional hydropower plants, except PSH has the ability to use the same water over and over again. However, traditional PSH has drawbacks: it requires elevated terrain and <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/04/f73/comparison-of-environmental-effects-open-loop-closed-loop-psh-1.pdf"">there are environmental concerns about ground- and surface water impacts</a>, so it is inherently geographically limited in its deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enter the company Quidnet Energy. Quidnet, working with researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, claims to have developed a novel approach to pumped hydropower that will solve these issues: <a href=""https://www.quidnetenergy.com/solution/"">Geomechanical Pumped Storage.</a></p>

<p><u>How Does it Work?</u></p>

<p>Stated very simply, Quidnet&rsquo;s Geomechanical Pumped Storage (GPS) system works by taking the ideas of PSH and literally inverting them by moving the storage underground. The system works in three steps: first, when electricity is abundant, the system pumps water from a pond down a well and into a thin lens of water contained in the bedrock. Second, the well is closed, keeping the energy stored under pressure between rock layers for as long as needed&ndash;usually one to two days. Third, when electricity is needed, the well is then opened to allow the pressurized water to pass through a turbine in order to generate electricity, and return to the pond ready for the next cycle. The natural elasticity of the rock <a href=""https://www.powermag.com/cps-energy-exploring-novel-geomechanical-pumped-storage-technology/"">performs like a spring</a> and holds the water under pressure until it is needed, at which time it is released through a hydroelectric turbine to produce electricity to send back to the grid. Quidnet describes themselves as an inverse fracking: the same technology is used, but instead of fracturing the bedrock, they seek to keep it sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quidnet has emphasized that its GPS system retains what works from traditional oil and gas drilling without the massive environmentally degrading impact. From their website, Quidnet states that their system &ldquo;is built on conventional drilling technology and off-the-shelf hydropower equipment. Facilities operate with closed-loop water systems, designed for conservation against evaporative loss. They also claim that there has been little-to-no fresh groundwater contamination due to several factors: first, being away from water wells, second,&nbsp; and the fact that their system is encased in concrete, and third, because they use farm-quality fresh water for their storage, so that even water that does escape does not carry the hydrocarbon or other water contamination that is involved with oil and gas fracking.</p>

<p>Quidnet also recognizes that the term &ldquo;fracking&rdquo; carries certain connotations and concerns, such as induced seismic events. Quidnet states that they avoid these concerns in two ways. First, their technology works at a much shallower level than oil and gas producing fracking: 1000-1500 feet subsurface, instead of the 5,000-20,000 feet below subsurface. Second, Quidnet states that, where they currently operate, they do not do their work near fault lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quidnet has operations, in place or planned, in upstate New York, Texas, Ohio, California, and even Alberta in Canada. Recently, in March of 2022, Texas-based CPS Energy, the largest municipally-owned electric and natural gas company in the country, <a href=""https://www.powermag.com/cps-energy-exploring-novel-geomechanical-pumped-storage-technology/"">entered into a 15-year commercial agreement</a> to explore installing up to 15 MW of Quidnet&rsquo;s GPS system. The agreement will kick off with a 1-MW project that will pump water into drilled wells and store it under pressure, providing up to 10 hours of long-duration energy storage.</p>

<p><u>Can It Be Implemented in Pennsylvania?</u></p>

<p>While Quidnet touts their system as versatile and adaptable to the geological diversity of the United States, some regions are more favorable than others. Due to the geological makeup of Pennsylvania, especially in the Western portion of the Commonwealth, Quidnet believes our region could be the next great expansion for their subsurface storage system program.</p>

<div>Of course, Pennsylvania already has plenty of wells drilled: the DEP estimates that <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/PDFProvider.ashx?action=PDFStream&amp;docID=1419023&amp;chksum=&amp;revision=0&amp;docName=ABANDONED+AND+ORPHAN+OIL+AND+GAS+WELLS+AND+THE+WELL+PLUGGING+PROGRAM&amp;nativeExt=pdf&amp;PromptToSave=False&amp;Size=411528&amp;ViewerMode=2&amp;overlay=0"">there are between 100,000-560,000 abandoned and orphaned gas wells</a> left to clean up and plug across the state. As a result, one Quidnet representative accurately, if unflatteringly, described Pennsylvania&rsquo;s bedrock as &ldquo;swiss cheese.&rdquo; While one&rsquo;s initial reaction to hearing about Quidnet&rsquo;s plans to drill more might be that the last thing<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>Pennsylvania needs is more holes in the ground, the good news is that Quidnet has reported to PennFuture that they actually have a way to utilize these wells. By using these pre-existing uncapped wells to help map and site locations for their GPS system, Quidnet can turn this potential liability into an asset. They call this the &ldquo;Clean Energy Geologic Resource Assessments&rdquo; (CEGRA) initiative. Quidnet hopes to double down on President Biden&rsquo;s efforts to find and cap orphaned wells by building out the orphaned well program to develop these new clean energy resources.</div>

<div><u>We Must Build a Green Energy Pennsylvanian Future</u></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PennFuture <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Its-Past-Time-for-Pennsylvania-to-Invest-in-Renewable-Energy"">has long called for a serious</a>, multifaceted local, state, and federal embrace of renewable energy in Pennsylvania. We believe it is crucial that our state divest from the environmentally harmful petrochemical buildout and refuse false solutions that merely temporarily keep the dying petrochemical industry alive. PennFuture has pointed to solar and wind power as clean energy alternatives to the dirty energy status quo. We are <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Basics-of-Hydrogen"">also monitoring other emerging technologies</a> such as green hydrogen. We are interested in the further research and development of other clean technologies like Geomechanical Pumped Storage, and believe tax dollars are better served exploring these areas instead of keeping harmful industries afloat.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u>Bottom Line</u></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>As we have explained <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-What-You-Wont-Hear-During-the-Aug-17-Public-Hearing-on-Pipelines-in-Pennsylvania"">in previous blogs</a>, green energy jobs are high-paying, reliable, and will continue into the future. Quidnet&rsquo;s GPS specifically uses much of the same machinery as traditional oil and gas fracking, meaning it can provide for a smooth transition for their workers. At the same time, Quidnet&rsquo;s GPS fundamentally avoids many of the environmental concerns of fracking. As traditional dirty energy wanes, it is imperative that Pennsylvania leads in the green collar revolution coming upon the horizon. Embracing alternative energy solutions will be key to building a new, green, economic present and future.</div>

Introducing PennFuture's New Legal Interns!,6/9/2022,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognized that we need to be more involved with cultivating the legal talent that will continue to support our mission. Our attorneys have a long history of mentoring legal interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor law students interested in making a difference for our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting the State as well as to further their potential careers in environmental law. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.</p>

<p>This summer, we have a fantastic group of law students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We&rsquo;ve asked our new legal interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</p>

<p><u><strong>Kayla Shellenhamer, rising Third Year student at Widener University Commonwealth Law School</strong></u></p>

<p>I am going into my third final year at Widener Commonwealth, where I am pursuing a J.D. and the Environmental Law Certificate. At Widener, I am the Vice-President of the Environmental Law and<img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/kayla.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 151px; float: right;"" />&nbsp; Policy Society.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate career, I really enjoyed my environmental science classes. As an extracurricular, I participated in environmental lobbying, which ignited my passion for change through policy. I graduated early with a degree in Environmental Writing and Policy.</p>

<p>To fill the semester between undergraduate and law school, I was able to Intern at the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. This allowed me to explore the inner workings of the legislative branch. I was able to author two original bills concerning food security, which were later introduced on the house floor. I enjoyed communicating with the public and seeing change through policy during my time at the House.</p>

<p>After my 1L year, I had the opportunity to intern at ProtectPT, a non-profit in Western PA. There, I was able to apply some of my legal skills to real-world problems. In my 2L year, I was able to take Environmental Law and Energy Law, which has allowed me to build knowledge in the specialized field. I am eager to continue my learning and experience at PennFuture this summer!</p>

<p><u><strong>Matthew Finnegan, rising Third Year student at Penn State Law</strong></u></p>

<p>Pursuing a J.D. and studying energy law, was not the path I had always envisioned myself going down. However, during my undergrad years, I learned about the issues of energy, from generation to<img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/matt.jpg"" style=""width: 115px; height: 150px; float: right;"" /> transmission, and fossil fuels to renewables, and how they are currently at the forefront of activity in PA, the place where I grew up and have spent most of my life. I have aimed my work to help the state propel its way into the future. I am so pleased to be an intern at PennFuture, where I am working with a group of people who are dedicated to keeping our state beautiful and safe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I graduated from Wilkes University with my B.A., where I double majored in political science and international relations. I also picked up minors in history and women and gender studies while in undergrad. This is where my interest in energy and environmental issues began. My political studies were aimed at energy and public opinion regarding energy, working as a research assistant during a comparative study of fracking. I now attend Penn State University Law School, where I have been able to complete more research on hydrogen energy and wind power. At PennFuture I am learning firsthand of how energy and environmental law looks in practice while also completing meaningful work to help better the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Joseph Feigin, rising Third Year student at Temple University Beasley School of Law</strong></u></p>

<p>Growing up, my parents instilled in me a deep appreciation for the outdoors. We&#39;d take family trips to mountains and forests. I also heard the phrase &ldquo;you should go to law school&rdquo; a lot as a kid<img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/joe.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 150px; float: right;"" /> so&nbsp;when the time came for me to apply to college my senior year, I decided those adults were right. I attended the University of Pittsburgh to get my BA in Philosophy. During those four years my appreciation for the outdoors and, as a result, the environment prospered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During my time there, I knew that I wanted to go to law school to become an environmental lawyer. It wouldn&#39;t be until my second year at Temple would I have the opportunity to actually do any legal environmental work. I spent a semester interning at the Clean Air Council. After that experience, I knew I made the right choice. My experience with CAC is what led me to PennFuture and I am thrilled to be spending my summer interning with so many talented environmental advocates.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, photography, and spending time outdoors.&nbsp;</p>

"Renewable Energy Projects Have Our Support, but Not At Any Cost",6/8/2022,"<p>The science of climate change is unimpeachable: society must transition to a clean energy economy to immediately lower our carbon footprint, or face the consequences of irreversible damage to the only home we have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Pennsylvania&rsquo;s leading environmental advocacy organization, PennFuture works daily to help achieve that goal in a place that is <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2022/02/24/Pennsylvania-carbon-dioxide-emissions-increase-power-plants-coal-gas-RGGI-climate/stories/202202240077"">one of the most notorious carbon polluters</a> in the nation. What that means is fighting against the proliferation of fracking and petrochemicals and beating back attempts in Harrisburg to further tether our economy to heavy industry while advocating for solar and wind energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What it doesn&rsquo;t mean, however, is embracing renewable energy at any cost, or allowing developers to create a false dichotomy of pitting renewable energy projects against pristine waters and bountiful forests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which brings us to the proposed <a href=""https://www.swiftwatersolar.com/"">Swiftwater Solar project in the Poconos</a>, an 80-megawatt solar field that developers intend to build by clearcutting 470 acres of mature woodlands on the top of a mountain right next to an Exceptional Value stream in Pocono Township.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following PennFuture for a while, you know that our focus in Northeast PA is to help protect the headwaters of the Delaware River Watershed. And the stream at issue here &ndash; Swiftwater Creek &ndash; is one that <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Celebrates-Legal-Victory-for-Exceptional-Value-Streams"">we have fought over already</a>, when these same development interests tried to strip away its Exceptional Value protections.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be labeled as Exceptional Value? For starters, only 2 percent of the thousands of streams and creeks in Pennsylvania have that designation based on the exceptional natural water quality and ecological value of the waters. Of that two percent labeled as Exceptional Value or &ldquo;EV&rdquo;, 80 percent are located in the Poconos. EV streams are unique and valuable resources, including outstanding trout fisheries that provide opportunities for recreation, aesthetic pleasure, and tourism.</p>

<p>PennFuture is in the business of transitioning to a clean energy economy, but we&rsquo;re also in the business of preserving these precious waters for generations to come. That&rsquo;s why PennFuture <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2022-06-06-PF-Ltr-to-BOC-re-Swiftwater-Solar.pdf"">submitted comments to the Pocono Township board of commissioners</a> asking them to delay a final vote on the project and instead schedule a public hearing so community members and stakeholders could have a meaningful opportunity to present evidence and testimony of the impacts of Swiftwater Solar on the local environment. Unfortunately, the commissioners rejected that request and <a href=""https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/poconos-coal/proposed-solar-field-that-would-be-poconos-largest-gets-approval-despite-resident-concerns/article_10414d08-e60c-11ec-89d5-eb7817fcdc6b.html?fbclid=IwAR1DNE2TOU-c87PkuIMknlwGYxf-g5W0eDcpyPTMdzGLGPG1KyDNMM8qH-M"">approved the project at a meeting on June 6.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that PennFuture doesn&rsquo;t stand alone in this fight. A poll <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.wordpress.com/2022/05/11/pocono-residents-support-more-action-to-protect-exceptional-value-streams-new-poll-finds/"">released by Our Pocono Waters in May</a> found strong support among Pocono residents for protecting the region&rsquo;s cleanest waters: 97% said that it was very important or somewhat important &ldquo;to protect and maintain Exceptional Value streams from added commercial development.&rdquo; Throughout the process, Brodhead Watershed Association <a href=""https://brodheadwatershed.org/wp-content/uploads/BWA-Swiftwater-Solar-Alert-Letter.pdf"">has been active in voicing its concerns</a> of the environmental impacts of this massive mountaintop project. As well, the Our Pocono Waters campaign submitted a letter <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Our-Pocono-Waters---Swiftwater-Solar-Letter-1.pdf"">at the Planning Commission phase</a> expressing the need for more consideration on potential water quality impacts to the EV Swiftwater Creek. If PennFuture&rsquo;s call for a public hearing would have been headed, these concerns could have been put before the Township Commissioners for consideration. Instead these concerns went unheard, and the project moves forward. The deck was stacked against those who were worried about the impacts of this massive energy development project &ndash; as it often is at the land use level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We realize that Swiftwater Solar was determined to be an &ldquo;essential service&rdquo; under the local zoning ordinance and that, as a result, it was a permissible use for this property. We acknowledge that Apex Energy, the designer of the project, is one of the leading green energy companies in the US and we support the work they &ndash; and companies like them &ndash; do to develop more renewable energy projects across the Commonwealth. We need more solar development in Pennsylvania. But it has to be more thoughtful than that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We must have responsible renewable energy development. And we must protect sensitive natural resource areas. These must not become mutually exclusive. We must not play into the fallacy that we can only have one. We must not be forced to pit our environmental interests against one another. There are best practices for siting renewable energy projects - and, unfortunately in the case of Swiftwater Solar, we just don&rsquo;t see how clearcutting almost 500 acres of trees on top of a steep mountain in an EV watershed is a good idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so while PennFuture continues to fight for increased renewable energy projects, while we champion our legislature to put money behind the development of large scale solar and wind instead of fracked gas outlets, and while we embrace federal, state, and local laws that encourage renewable energy, we must remain vigilant that renewable energy developers look for thoughtful siting locations and design elements that preserve rather than destroy sensitive natural resources. Pennsylvanians should not be forced into choosing one at the expense of the other.&nbsp;</p>

"PA Environmental Leaders, State Senators Discuss the Failure of Shale Gas Policies and Negative Public Health Impacts of Industry",6/7/2022,"<p>On June 2nd, State Senator Katie Muth, chair of the Pennsylvania Senate Democratic Policy Committee, joined Senator Jim Brewster, Senator Lindsey Williams, and Senator Jay Costa at CCAC&rsquo;s Boyce Campus in Monroeville to host&nbsp;a public hearing on state policy and health impacts of the shale gas industry in Pennsylvania. The hearing, entitled <em>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Shale Gas Boom: How Policy Decisions Failed to Protect Public Health and What We Can Do to Correct It</em>, focused on the health impacts of shale gas infrastructure in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The hearing included testimony from impacted residents, public health and policy experts, and environmental advocacy leaders. Environmental Health Project (EHP), whose leadership was present, recently released <a href=""https://www.environmentalhealthproject.org/_files/ugd/a9ce25_92b1ee87271140d5b9f93e174cfc849c.pdf"">a white paper of the same name.</a></p>

<p>Specifically, the panelists included Gillian Graber, Executive Director, Protect PT; Cathy Lodge, Washington County resident; Mackenzie White, Public Health Manager, EHP; Dr. Brian Schwartz, Professor of Environmental Health and Engineering, Epidemiology, and Medicine, Johns Hopkins University; Lisa Graves-Marcucci, Pennsylvania Coordinator, Community Outreach, Environmental Integrity Project (EIP); and Alison L. Steele, Executive Director, EHP.</p>

<p>Much of the hearing included very personal accounts of the negative impacts of petrochemical buildout in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Each speaker lived close to, and interacted daily with, a fracked gas well or facility. In her testimony,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.senatormuth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gillian-Graber-Written-Testimony.pdf"">Graber cited an operator</a> with hundreds of recorded violations to health, safety and the environment, on record with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, being permitted to build 4 well pads less than a mile from a school in her area. Another operator, also with hundreds of documented violations, is also permitted to build a well pad 1,500 feet from a school. Ms. Lodge stated <a href=""https://www.senatormuth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cathy-Lodge-Written-Testimony.pdf"">in her testimony</a> that the <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/fort-cherry-schools-another-gas-drilling-permit/"">Fort Cherry school district in Washington County</a> is surrounded by 40 fracked gas wells.</p>

<p>When discussing policy solutions to better protect public health, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and Department of Health (DOH) were frequently mentioned. Specifically, the panelists agreed that the DEP was by and large not enforcing regulations partially due to a lack of staffing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Senator Williams asked how DEP and DOH could be improved. Lisa Graves-Marcucci from EIP cited that, while she knows many well-intentioned DEP staff, there exists a revolving door between the petrochemical industry and DEP, as highlighted in State Attorney General Shapiro&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/43rd-statewide-grand-jury-finds-pennsylvania-failed-to-protect-citizens-during-fracking-boom/"">43rd Grand Jury Report.</a> Ms. Marcucci also cited <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=4221701&amp;DocName=ENVIRONMENTAL%20JUSTICE%20POLICY.PDF%20%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:green%3b%22%3eCOMMENTS%20DUE%20MAY%2011%2c%202022%3c/span%3e%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:blue%3b%22%3e%28NEW%29%3c/span%3e"">DEP&rsquo;s proposed draft Environmental Justice policy</a> (in which <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-DEPs-Revised-Environmental-Justice-Policy-A-Good-Start-but-More-Needs-to-Be-Done-to-Protect-PAs-Environmental-Justice-Communities"">PennFuture submitted comments</a>), stating that to her knowledge the DEP has not denied permits in 25 years.</p>

<p>Marcucci also stated that health and safety boards need their composition examined, as she sees petrochemical industry influence throughout the organization.&nbsp;Finally,&nbsp; Marcucci recommended that more municipalities should consider high corporate bonds tied to specific projects, citing ordinances in Indiana Township and Smith Township in Allegheny and Washington Counties, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steele stated that the DOH has been silent on this issue of public health concerns from fracking, especially when they have been vocal and effective in addressing other issues like COVID-19.&nbsp; Steele also believes that there is a lack of clear mandate to address this issue; DOH should be empowered to take on the negative health effects of the petrochemical buildout. Specifically, DOH should take a firmer stance on the issue, give information to residents on chemicals used, provide guidance to residents on how to protect their health, and provide guidance to health professionals and how to provide a robust response to patients when health concerns related to the issue arises.</p>

<p>Senator Williams added that DEP and DOH employees need increased whistleblower protections: the ability to recover attorneys fees after a suit, reinstatement, and other protections and incentives to speak out which currently are not afforded under state law.</p>

<p>All panelists agreed: with the conversation around hydrogen beginning in Pennsylvania, we must not repeat the mistakes from the fracking boom. We need to ask all the questions upfront &ndash; especially how it will impact the health and safety of residents.</p>

The True Cost of Convenience: The Impacts of Never-Ending Warehouse Development,5/31/2022,"<p>There are costs to irresponsible, endless development. The current trend in Pennsylvania&#39;s area of the Delaware River Basin is the expansion of massive warehouses and logistics centers. With these projects come the subsequent increase in truck traffic, diesel fumes, infrastructure damage, and stormwater runoff. Warehouses and logistics centers have severe consequences for the health of the surrounding communities and the environment, and very few benefits.</p>

<p>Driven by the convenience (and safety) of online shopping and the expectation of receiving goods within 24&nbsp;hours of clicking a button, developers are purchasing land for the sole purpose of building these behemoths. Now, the expansion of the warehouse house empire is beginning to branch north from the current distribution hub of the East Coast - the Lehigh Valley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Folks living in the quiet, rural communities of the Pocono Mountains are witnessing hundreds of thousands of square feet of forest and wetlands get paved over and transformed into cubes of convenient consumption. These communities are shocked and dismayed, fighting to protect the pristine landscape and unique biodiversity that characterizes the region. Oftentimes, they say that they don&#39;t want their region to mirror the distribution hub of Lehigh Valley.</p>

<p>And with good reason. Online shopping created a distribution and logistics bubble that&#39;s continued to grow for the last ten to fifteen years in the third largest metropolitan area of Pennsylvania. The distribution economy <a href=""https://www.city-journal.org/pennsylvania-lehigh-valley-supply-chain-empire"">has created over 30,000 jobs across Northampton and Lehigh counties</a>. That&#39;s a lot - about 11% of local residents are employed in the industry. But these jobs come at a high price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While developers are offered tax breaks, taxpayers end up covering the cost of damaged infrastructure and the increased need for municipal services. What&#39;s more is that communities that&nbsp;already experience the impacts of pollution, heat deserts, and a lack of green space are exposed to increased diesel fumes from heavy truck traffic. In 2021, Allentown was considered the &quot;Asthma Capital&quot; of the Northeast Mid-Atlantic region, according to the <a href=""https://www.aafa.org/asthma-capitals/"">Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America</a>. Their studies show that the combined issues of exposure to industrial businesses and high-traffic roads with a lack of access to asthma specialists primes residents for this illness. Because we know that communities of color more often than not bear the burden of the cumulative impacts of pollution, it should not be surprising that the city&#39;s population is 54% Latino and 13% Black or African American. Yes, this industry provides jobs, but at what cost? And to whom?</p>

<p>Some wonder if what&#39;s touted as &quot;economic growth&quot; is as robust as it seems. According to local officials in Lower Macungie Township - a community outside of the city of Allentown - &quot;If a warehouse employs 100 people but eats up 100 acres of farmland, the Valley economy <a href=""https://www.city-journal.org/pennsylvania-lehigh-valley-supply-chain-empire"">only nets one job per acre of precious land lost.&quot;</a>&nbsp; This is not an efficient use of land, especially when considering the loss of ecological services provided by that land. The impervious surface - or pavement and buildings - created by warehouses and distribution centers increases stormwater runoff, which then increases the intensity and frequency of flooding. Rather than soil and plants soaking up the rain, the water sheds right off, inundating streets, storm sewers, and creeks. And once again, the communities that experience the most flooding in the Lehigh Valley tend to be Black and brown communities. The environmental impacts continue to accumulate.</p>

<p>It is a different picture in the Poconos, however. There is a lot of open space, fresh air, and clean streams. Wetlands and forests abound - for now.</p>

<p>For Pocono residents, the development of warehouses and distribution centers threatens the character of their rural communities, the health of pristine streams, and the prospect of generational wealth.</p>

<p>Over 30% of Pennsylvania&#39;s waterways are polluted and degraded. However, there are pockets of clean, pristine creeks and streams, but they are few. Only 2% of Pennsylvania&#39;s waterways are healthy enough to receive the DEP&#39;s special designation of Exceptional Value. These are the cleanest, healthiest streams in the state. They have intact and abundant ecosystems and contain pure water. 80% of them can be found in the mountain, wetlands, and forests of the Poconos.</p>

<p>According to an industry white paper, warehouse developers are looking to northeastern Pennsylvania to expand their empire for a few reasons - decrease in unionization of workers, lower wages, low taxes, <a href=""https://mericlereadytogo.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/distribution-white-paper-mweb.pdf"">and the land is cheap and abundant.</a> While all of that is good for profit, it is very bad for the communities and the environment. Recent plans brought in front of municipalities demonstrate a willingness to build along Exceptional Value streams, which if done poorly, could permanently reduce water quality, threaten wildlife, and increase flooding.</p>

<p>The prevalence of warehouses reduces land values. Folks that live in the Poconos tend to have long-term ties to the region. For some, their house and property is their single source of wealth. It&#39;s been passed down through their family. But when a warehouse or distribution center abuts the property line, land value suddenly drops.</p>

<p>There are no guarantees that these massive buildings - usually 250,000 square feet or more - will be filled with what&#39;s called an &quot;end user&quot;. It&#39;s all speculative. Developers may pave over wetlands and impair trout streams without ever placing a business in the building. There are some along Route 512 that have stood empty for years. That&#39;s likely to continue if Amazon&#39;s business trends are any indication. The online shopping giant is starting to lease its space because it is unable to use it. The distribution bubble is on its way to bursting. But because of the flawed land use and development process currently in place, developers don&#39;t need to guarantee business in order to build.</p>

<p>Local government officials in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos realize that land use laws and zoning codes need to change to put an end to this expansion. The Municipal Planning Code was originally established to protect the health, safety, and character of communities. Every municipality must allow for every &quot;use&quot; included in the MPC. However, developers are taking advantage of the term &quot;warehouse&quot;. When the term was initially included, distribution centers that take up one million square feet of land and boast 300-400 truck trips were inconceivable. But because the term is included in the zoning codes, the use must be allowed. That&#39;s why municipal leaders <a href=""https://www.city-journal.org/pennsylvania-lehigh-valley-supply-chain-empire"">are calling on state legislators to take action and change the codes.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>When we allow for the pervasive and unchecked development of warehouses,&nbsp;we are choosing corporate profits and convenient consumption over healthy communities and a healthy environment.</p>

DEP’s Revised Environmental Justice Policy: A Good Start but More Needs to Be Done to Protect PA’s Environmental Justice Communities,5/19/2022,"<p>Earlier this year, the PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) released its revised <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/OfficeofEnvironmentalJustice/Pages/Policy-Revision.aspx"">Environmental Justice Public Participation Policy.</a> This policy, last released in 2004, is intended to help guide the Department in integrating Environmental Justice (EJ) into more aspects of the work within regulatory limits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On May 11, 2022, PennFuture submitted two public comments on the proposed revision (see <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/RecommendationsDraftEJPolicy_05112022_Final.docx.pdf"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/CAC-PF-EIP-MWA-PE-EJ-Poly-Comments---Doc-No-012-0501-002.pdf"">here</a>). As I outline below, DEP&rsquo;s Policy, while a great and necessary start, focuses only on informing the community of the potential for more pollution from a new facility while failing to do anything to prevent that increased pollution burden to the community. In short, DEP must make this policy a regulation and must deny permits that could disproportionately harm EJ communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>What is Environmental Justice?</u></p>

<p>Environmental Justice is <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/learn-about-environmental-justice"">defined by the US EPA</a> as &ldquo;the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies.&rdquo; The purpose of EJ is to rectify and bring justice to those communities that have long suffered a disproportionate burden of pollution based on race, income, and other institutionalized factors <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/redlining"">such as redlining</a> and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-More-than-Skin-Deep-Environmental-Racism-Justice-and-Pennsylvania"">environmental racism</a>. Also known as <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114843/#:~:text=Sacrifice%20zones%20are%20often%20%E2%80%9Cfenceline,polluted%20industries%20or%20military%20bases."">&ldquo;sacrifice zones,&rdquo;</a> EJ communities include the frontline and fence-line communities where there is a disproportionate concentration of toxic facilities and other pollution sources.</p>

<p>DEP <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/OfficeofEnvironmentalJustice/Pages/PA-Environmental-Justice-Areas.aspx"">defines an EJ Area</a> as a community where at least 20% of the population have incomes below the federal poverty line and/or 30% identify as non-white. DEP has created an <a href=""https://padep-1.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=f31a188de122467691cae93c3339469c"">Environmental Justice Area Viewer</a> to help communities, applicants, and agencies identify EJ Areas and &ldquo;Areas of Concern&rdquo; for which its Public Participation Policy applies. Under this policy DEP limits the Area of Concern in the EJ community to a 0.5-mile radius from the proposed facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>What is DEP&rsquo;s Environmental Justice Public Participation Policy?</u></p>

<p>First off, what is a DEP &ldquo;policy&rdquo;? DEP policies are written, nonbinding documents that outline procedures that Department and others may put in place and actions they may take to meet the requirements of an environmental law or outline key practices of an agency or organization. Policies can be viewed as guidance for the agency. As the DEP explains, the law (statutes, regulations) tells the agency what to do and the policy says how DEP should do it. Consequently, unlike laws, there is no legal recourse should DEP fail to follow its own policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the name denotes, DEP&rsquo;s EJ Public Participation Policy is limited to outlining the actions that DEP should take to reach out to and receive feedback from EJ communities. In short, this policy includes (but is not limited to) the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A process for identifying permits applications that would trigger this policy or otherwise cause this policy to apply</li>
	<li>A process for informing residents in an EJ Area that an applicant is applying for a permit from DEP to build, operate, or modify a facility that will impact the public health or the environment, including through public hearings and information sessions</li>
	<li>A process for receiving feedback from impacted residents and responding in writing to that feedback</li>
	<li>Specific processes for public engagement on the permitting of oil and gas facilities</li>
	<li>Definitions of key terms such as &ldquo;environmental justice area&rdquo;, &ldquo;area of concern&rdquo;, &ldquo;trigger permits&rdquo;, and &ldquo;opt-in permits&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><u>DEP Must Strengthen Its EJ Policy</u></p>

<p>The most fundamental problem with DEP&rsquo;s Policy is that it does not specifically call on DEP to deny permits that would disproportionately harm or add to the already disproportionate pollution burden of EJ communities. DEP has clear statutory and constitutional authority and duty to shape the substantive outcomes of the permitting process and without recognizing and setting forth this authority, the Policy fails to promote the fair treatment or meaningful involvement of all Pennsylvanians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is not to say that we don&rsquo;t encourage and support DEP doing everything it can to have a robust and inclusive public participation process regarding permitting of polluting facilities in EJ communities. Education, outreach, understanding, and listening are critical elements of the public participation process that for too long have been denied to frontline and fence-line communities. Making the process easier to understand and navigate is essential to overcome the long history of ignoring the health and concerns of these overburdened, under-resourced, and often dismissed communities. DEP must do everything it can to communicate with and listen to EJ communities.</p>

<p>However, if all DEP does is receive input from an EJ community, without changing the course based on that input, then it can only continue to perpetuate the disproportionate impact on the communities. DEP must give these communities the power to reject facilities and must be able to deny permits that will contribute additional pollution. To achieve &ldquo;fair treatment&rdquo; of &ldquo;all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income,&rdquo; DEP must prevent (and reverse) the buildup of cumulative and disparate harms on black and brown communities, immigrant communities, and low-income communities, even if each application it receives appears to comply with other regulatory requirements. To achieve &ldquo;meaningful involvement,&rdquo; the public&rsquo;s comments and opposition must be able to change the outcome of DEP&rsquo;s decisionmaking.</p>

<p>Moreover, DEP must establish formal EJ regulations &ndash; which&nbsp;have the full force of law &ndash; that protect EJ communities from additional polluting facilities. Again, while this Policy is better than before, leaving EJ to a policy robs communities of the ability to hold DEP accountable for any failure to protect EJ communities. Additionally, industry will take such a rule more seriously than a policy, and DEP could actually require applicants to provide DEP with the information it needs to meaningfully advance environmental justice. Finally, a rule can empower Pennsylvanians suffering from environmental injustice to fight for their future: while a policy may encourage public comment, residents can enforce a rule through appeals or other legal action.</p>

<p>Barring these two critical factors to DEP truly protecting the health and environmental rights of EJ communities, our comments also offered a number of changes that could improve the Policy to better protect the health of EJ communities, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Better and more meaningful ways to identify and include communities that need environmental justice;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Expanding the geographic scope of &ldquo;Areas of Concern&rdquo; to appropriately capture the impact of the pollution from many common types of facilities;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A more inclusive definition of the types of permits that trigger the application of the Policy;</li>
	<li>A more inclusive and robust application of &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo; permits;</li>
	<li>Providing for better accessibility to permit applications, documents, and information, including providing a dedicated website for EJ-related permit applications and documents and easy access to electronic documents;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>An automatic extension of the 30-day public comment period, especially when requested by the public, and more inclusive and robust access to public hearings;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Fair compensation for community liaisons;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Develop and strengthen partnerships and meaningful relationships with frontline and fence-line communities;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Develop educational materials and presentations to better inform communities as to this policy and other agency and regulatory processes and how to engage in them; and</li>
	<li>Independent verification by DEP of whether the facility would impact an EJ Area or Area of Concern.</li>
</ul>

<p>DEP is currently reviewing the comments it received from the public.&nbsp;We call on the Department to center the voices, concerns, and comments of frontline, fence-line, and environmental justice communities and organizations. We hope that DEP takes seriously its duty to protect EJ communities from further harm, and will continue to explore opportunities to elevate, coordinate with, and represent Environmental Justice communities in Pennsylvania.</p>

Exhibiting Art and Fighting Climate Change,5/18/2022,"<p><em>Photo Credit: A hologram of Edgar Degas&#39;s Petite danseuse de quatorze ans (1927), previously on view at Christie&#39;s San Francisco and Hong Kong branches. Courtesy of Christie&#39;s.</em></p>

<p>More than 25 years ago I argued in my Master&rsquo;s thesis, for Art Education at Penn State, that art museums should create virtual museums online to increase their accessibility and improve their educational outreach. If I was to write that thesis today it would be somewhat different. First off, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have to include a chapter on what the &ldquo;World Wide Web&rdquo; is or how a hyperlink works. More importantly though, I would devote much of the thesis to how art museums can embrace virtual technology to reduce their carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to imagine, but back in the mid-nineties there was actually a lot of resistance in the art world to even posting digital photographs of works from their collections online. The concern, for some, was that when an original work of art is &ldquo;mechanically&rdquo; reproduced it becomes inferior to the original, destroying what critic Walter Benjamin called its &ldquo;aura&rdquo; which diminishes the viewers experience of both the original and the reproduction. Others were worried that the dollar value of original works would be compromised if viewers could &ldquo;steal&rdquo; (or copy and save) images. Given the ridiculous growth of the global art market since, <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/1119/art-market/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20global%20art%20market,(COVID%2D19)%20pandemic."">currently valued at $65.1 billion dollars annually</a>, I think the industry is doing just fine.</p>

<p>I thought back to my thesis while reading an article about how <a href=""https://news.artnet.com/market/christies-touring-edgar-degas-hologram-around-world-advance-anne-bass-sale-2104580"">the auction house Christie&rsquo;s has created an incredibly realistic hologram</a> of a fragile Degas ballerina sculpture, valued at $20 million, that they are sending on a virtual world tour. I haven&rsquo;t seen the actual hologram in person but the photograph of it is indistinguishable from a photograph of the original work. It&rsquo;s an amazing use of the technology <a href=""https://www.portlhologram.com/"">created by a company called Proto</a> to beam high resolution holograms of actual people around the world. Christie&rsquo;s has chosen to use the tech primarily to reduce shipping and insurance costs, but also, they say, because it reduces their carbon footprint. This is a concern that unfortunately few people in the art world had back in the nineties, when I was in grad school, but is now on the forefront of everyone&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been with PennFuture <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Artists-Interpreting-Climate-Change-Part-3"">I&rsquo;ve written a number of blogs</a> about how &ldquo;EcoArtists&rdquo; are creating works that use the environment as a subject matter, as a medium, and sometimes as a result of their work. Most recently <a href=""https://youtu.be/jdZ9ZxwV47Y"">I hosted an online panel discussion</a> with a number of artists involved in creating the book EcoArt in Action. For this article I want to focus specifically on how the exhibitors of art - museums, galleries, and auction houses such as Christie&rsquo;s - are addressing their role in climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Climate change, and its effects, are certainly on the radar of museum professionals today. The <a href=""https://www.pamm.org/about/building"">P&eacute;rez Art Museum</a>, recently built on the bay in Miami and the <a href=""https://www.aam-us.org/2020/12/11/facing-the-rising-tide-how-the-whitney-museum-of-american-art-addresses-resiliency-and-storm-preparedness-through-design"">Whitney Museum of American Art&rsquo;s Renzo Piano</a>, located next to the Hudson River, were both designed to withstand predicted flooding caused by climate change. Last year the <a href=""https://noma.org/hurricane-ida-update/"">New Orleans Museum of Art</a> had to close to the public for a few weeks because of Hurricane Ida and get their power from emergency generators to keep the steady temperature and humidity needed to protect their collection. Fortunately, because of lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina, they had an extreme weather event plan in place. Other museums have taken notice. Today there is even a regular conference for museum professionals on protecting their collections, and buildings, from increased flooding called <a href=""https://historyabovewater.org/"">Keeping History Above Water.</a></p>

<p>But what can galleries and museums do to not just protect themselves but to actually reduce their carbon footprint?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some museums are making significant efforts to be more sustainable, such as getting Leadership in Energy and environmental Design (LEED) certification for their buildings. LEED provides a framework for healthy, highly efficient, and cost-saving green buildings. In Pennsylvania both the Erie Art Museum and the Barnes Foundation, among others, are LEED certified. <a href=""https://blooloop.com/sustainability/in-depth/sustainable-museums/"">Here is a list</a> of the top 17 sustainable museums in the world, including one of my favorites, the Grand Rapids Art Museum in Michigan.</p>

<p>These architectural efforts in building design are extremely important but they don&rsquo;t reduce the amount of energy used to transport art &ndash; which is where the art world has the greatest impact on the environment. The costs for packaging and shipping art (think lots of bubble wrap and crates, cargo ships and airplanes, security and couriers, plus insurance) for a &ldquo;blockbuster&rdquo; touring exhibition to museums around the globe can be extraordinary. Individual museums will often pay anywhere from around a hundred thousand to a few million just for the transportation of paintings. Transporting sculptures weighing thousands of pounds can cost even more. The trend of museums offering &ldquo;immersive&rdquo; experiences is certainly a result of this consideration &ndash; it is much less costly (for the museum and the environment) to project images of Van Gogh on a gallery wall than it is to ship all those artworks to multiple museums. And given their popularity, audiences are apparently okay with not seeing the original if they can walk through a reproduction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps the worst climate offenders in the art world are the huge international fairs, such as Art Basel Miami, the Frieze Art Fair in London and New York, and Art Dubai. When you take into account the climate footprint of building temporary exhibition spaces, with energy sucking lighting and climate control, and the thousands of international jet-setters flying in and out to these events, the environmental impact can be devastating. Acknowledging the carbon footprint of the hundreds of art fairs held each year is something the art world <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/c8f21a30-8386-11e9-a7f0-77d3101896ec"">has just started to get comfortable in talking about.</a></p>

<p>Of course exhibitors can&rsquo;t reduce their footprint unless they know how big it is. One group taking the lead on helping the art world do this is the <a href=""https://galleryclimatecoalition.org/"">Gallery Climate Coalition</a>. Their goal is to facilitate the decarbonization of the visual art sector and promote zero-waste practices. This international collective of hundreds of art professionals has a plan to reduce the carbon emissions from galleries, museums, and fairs by at least 50% by 2030 (in line with the Paris Agreement). One way they do this is by providing a <a href=""https://galleryclimatecoalition.org/carbon-calculator/"">free online carbon calculator</a> to determine the footprint of transporting artworks to exhibits, fairs, and festivals. Last November they hosted, online, the conference &ldquo;Decarbonizing the Art World&rdquo; and published their <a href=""https://cdn.flowcode.com/prodassets/GCC_DECARBONISATION_ACTION_PLAN_2021.pdf?ts=1637663739637018874"">&ldquo;Decarbonization Action Plan&rdquo;</a>. Most of their suggested actions recognize that the art world is not going to give up the physical object anytime soon and therefore the tips are practical, physical, ways to reduce waste and energy consumption such as using LED lighting, reusable crates, and recycling packing material. They also promote decarbonization through innovation, such as utilizing virtual exhibits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though the early concerns from the art world about jeopardizing an artwork&rsquo;s &ldquo;aura&rdquo; have not prevented museums from being online, there were still some who resisted creating virtual exhibitions for a number of years because the poor quality of the technology compromised the visitor&rsquo;s experience. As the technology improved this became less of an issue, yet many museums still were reluctant to embrace virtual exhibitions because of a fear it would reduce revenue from in-person visits. What has been encouraging to see during the past two years is that because of Covid restrictions many museums and galleries, who couldn&rsquo;t open their physical doors, were &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; into having virtual versions of their physical exhibits to be able to continue to reach their audiences. A great example of this is <a href=""https://www.seattleartmuseum.org/Pages/our-blue-planet-global-visions-of-water.aspx"">&ldquo;Our Blue Planet: Global Visions of Water&rdquo;</a> created by the Seattle Art Museum and featuring works from the museum&rsquo;s permanent collection or on loan from local collectors &ndash; minimizing transportation costs of the art.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Something many museums have recently realized was that these virtual exhibits allowed them to reach a far broader audience while reducing exhibition costs and their carbon footprint. In fact, so many arts institutions started to create virtual content during the past two years that Google launched <a href=""https://artsandculture.google.com/"">Google Arts and Culture</a> in partnership with them as a response. Here you can &ldquo;visit&rdquo; almost every major art museum in the world, including the Met, MoMA, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, without having to get in a plane, train, or car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately the past few years have also seen one of the greatest upheavals in the world of virtual art with the popularity of cryptocurrency and Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). When I first heard about these &ldquo;digital markers&rdquo; and how they could be used to identify the one &ldquo;original&rdquo; image in a world of digital copies I was certainly intrigued. For the first time, artists who work in the digital world could make truly unique images that were protected with this certification of authenticity. It sounded like a great idea. I&rsquo;m not going to dwell on this too much here because I wanted this blog to focus on the positive changes the art world has been making regarding climate change. NFTs are not a part of it. Unfortunately, NFTs are a huge step backwards environmentally because they rely on &ldquo;blockchains&rdquo; and the ridiculous amount of energy required to run the computers creating them and cryptocurrency (a much better explanation of how this all works <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Terrible-Excuses-to-Mine-Bitcoin"">was written by my co-worker, Rob Altenburg)</a>. It&rsquo;s a shame that the amount of money associated with NFTs at this point is so great &ndash; <a href=""https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/pursuits/art-culture/nfts-quiet-revolution-art-world/"">literally billions during the past year</a> -&nbsp;that many people are choosing to ignore their environmental impact. Someday there may be a way to sustainably create NFTs, but it is a long way away from today&rsquo;s technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite my serious concerns about NFTs I am greatly encouraged by the responsibility that museums and galleries are taking for their role in fighting climate change and reducing their carbon footprint. And I can&rsquo;t wait to see how this new hologram technology will be used by museums, galleries, and artists to show and create works all around the world without damaging the Earth. It is certainly not something I could have predicted some 25 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

New Solar Energy Discoveries Suggest an Even Brighter Renewable Energy Future,5/8/2022,"<p>In 2017, Dr. Kasper Moth-Poulson and his team at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden made headlines with their<a href=""https://newatlas.com/most-transportable-solar-energy-storage/48596/""> breakthrough discovery</a> that solar energy can be stored as a liquid for up to 18 years and be released as heat when needed. In the last several weeks, Moth-Poulson&rsquo;s team has made a further discovery &ndash; the <a href=""https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/04/12/solar-energy-can-now-be-stored-for-up-to-18-years-say-scientists"">stored solar energy can produce electricity </a>by connecting it to a thermoelectric generator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a time where the severe consequences of climate change is looking increasingly unavoidable &ndash; largely caused by our almost singular reliance on dirty energy past and present &ndash; the world is scrambling for alternatives to our current energy consumption habits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Solar energy is becoming increasingly affordable and abundant. Last year, the United States added nearly <a href=""https://irena.org/publications/2022/Apr/Renewable-Capacity-Statistics-2022"">20 GigaWatts of solar capacity. </a>Advancements in solar energy research and development could further expedite the rise of renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rather than debate how we can best expand solar energy across Pennsylvania,&nbsp; discussions have focused on questionable technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage (also referred to as &ldquo;CCUS&rdquo;). <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Chasing-the-Rainbow-Carbon-Capture-is-Magic-Thinking"">PennFuture recently published a blog</a> where we warned about leaning too heavily into CCUS, as it has not proven to be the effective, climate-friendly solution as advertised. This is especially the case when comparing CCUS to other green alternative energy sources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike solar energy, CCUS relies on existing and sustained environmentally-degrading carbon output. Solar energy is infinitely renewable and virtually entirely clean. The solar energy system created at Chalmers, also known as Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage Systems or &ldquo;MOST&rdquo;, provides a fascinating and promising future for both solar and the green alternative energy space as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As it stands today, solar energy provides <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/SolarFuture/Pages/Pennsylvania%27s-Solar-Future-Plan.aspx"">less than 1 percent of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s electricity.</a> There is clearly room for the growth of the Pennsylvania green energy sector, and state government officials have begun to take notice. In March 2021, Governor Tom Wolf announced a <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-announces-largest-government-solar-energy-commitment-in-the-u-s/"">clean energy initiative </a>that would produce nearly 50 percent of the state government&rsquo;s electricity from solar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Increased state investment in solar would not only be beneficial for our environment, it can also kickstart the Pennsylvania economy. Proof of this already exists. <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Energy/Office of Energy and Technology/OETDPortalFiles/2020EnergyReport/2020PACEIR.pdf"">The 2020 Pennsylvania Clean Energy Employment report</a> showed that clean energy industries (overall) added nearly 7,800 jobs in Pennsylvania in 2017-2019, for an 8.7 percent average job growth rate, significantly exceeding the average overall job growth in the state. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar workforce grew by 8.3 percent, well above the state average job growth rate.</p>

<p>Leaning heavily into solar simply makes sense from a consumer, environmental, and broader economic sense. On average, most residents can save between<a href=""https://www.solar-nation.org/Pennsylvania""> $200 to $800 </a>on their utility bills each year by leasing or buying a solar panel system. While Pennsylvania does not currently offer any state tax credits for solar energy, some can receive at least a 22% Federal solar tax credit. Pennsylvania does provide<a href=""https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/pa""> cost-saving programs </a>to assist those who want to transition to solar power for their homes.</p>

<p>Solar, along with other renewable energy, is now the cheapest it has ever been in history. So why have we not embraced it with open arms? It would require a lot of dismantling of status-quo policies that keep fossil fuels profitable despite their decline. In fact, the regulatory structure of utilities actually makes it more profitable to keep a coal or fossil fuel plant running. <a href=""http://marcellusmoney.org/about"">With fossil fuel companies bankrolling elected officials</a> to keep <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-Buried-Out-of-Sight-PennFuture-Releases-New-Report-that-Shines-Light-on-Massive-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Doled-out-in-Pennsylvania"">fossil fuel tax breaks</a> in place, the much-need Just Transition has been continuously delayed.</p>

<p>Taking climate change seriously, through significant investment in research, development, and implementation can result in breakthroughs with worldwide implications &ndash; as seen with the constant achievements of Dr. Moth-Poulson and his team in Sweden. Pennsylvania is at an economic crossroads, rebuilding after a pandemic and the decline of traditional dirty energy which once built the Commonwealth. Green, clean, alternative energy can provide good paying (union) jobs, research opportunities for our world-renowned universities, and a cleaner environment for our Commonwealth.</p>

Pennsylvania Finally Caps Carbon Pollution From Power Plants: Now What?,5/3/2022,"<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s plans to cut carbon pollution from fossil fuel power plants took a big step forward on April 23. After many delays, the Legislative Reference Bureau published the final CO2 Budget Trading Program, also known as the<a href=""http://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pabull?file=/secure/pabulletin/data/vol52/52-17/625.html"" target=""_blank""> &ldquo;Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Rule.&rdquo;&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>This means that, after years of work &ndash; with considerable input from the public &ndash; the program Governor Tom Wolf announced with Executive Order 2019-07 back in October 2019 will finally go into effect. Pennsylvania will&nbsp;start to limit the carbon pollution from fossil fuel electric generation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How RGGI Will Work for Pennsylvania&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Under RGGI, each participating state decides how much carbon pollution they will allow, otherwise known as a &ldquo;cap.&rdquo; For each ton of carbon emissions allowed under that cap, the states create an &ldquo;allowance.&rdquo; &nbsp;Operators of large electric generators &mdash; like a coal or fracked gas power plant &mdash; must obtain one allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) they emit, most of which will likely be purchased at quarterly RGGI auctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each state will get a share of auction proceeds commensurate with their auction allowances. States can choose how they want to invest the money. &nbsp;The first auction that Pennsylvania power plants will participate in is scheduled for September 7, 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under existing Pennsylvania law, namely the Air Pollution Control Act, proceeds will be deposited in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)&rsquo;s Clean Air Fund for use in programs or initiatives that further reduce air pollution. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania Power Plants Won&rsquo;t Have to Pay for All Their Pollution Right Away&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The RGGI program runs on a three-calendar-year &ldquo;control period&rdquo; with each of the first two years serving as &ldquo;interim control periods.&rdquo; Power plants eventually need to obtain allowances for each ton of CO2 they emit during the entire control period. But they don&rsquo;t need them all right away. For each of the interim control periods, they only need allowances for half of their emissions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the delay in starting the program, Pennsylvania will start participating in the RGGI auctions in the middle of 2022, part way through one of the three-year control periods. What this means is, for 2022, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s electric generators will only need to obtain credits for carbon pollution they emit between July 1 and the end of the year. Also, since 2022 is the second interim control period, companies only need allowances for half of their 2022 emissions by midnight March 1, 2023. Then, by March 1, 2024, they will need allowances for all their 2023 emissions plus any remaining 2022 emissions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Power Plant Companies Have Many Options to Reduce Carbon Pollution&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>While most companies that own power plants are expected to bid for the credits they need during the quarterly auctions, they have other options:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>A company could invest in process improvements or otherwise reduce the amount of fossil fuels they burn and the pollution they emit;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Companies could invest in eligible CO2 emissions offset projects. Examples include verified projects that sequester carbon through reforestation initiatives, avoid emissions through improved forest management practices, or reduce pollution from other sources such as landfill gas or agricultural methane; &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Companies could participate in the &ldquo;secondary market&rdquo; where they can trade not only allowances with other companies, but also financial derivatives such as futures, forwards, and options; or&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Some companies may even be able to structure their operations to qualify for allowances from other set-aside programs like those for combined heat and power units.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Fight Over Pennsylvania and RGGI Isn&rsquo;t Over Yet&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Of course, many polluting companies prefer the status quo where they can dump their carbon emissions into the air for free. Their friends in the legislature did everything they could to stop the program from going forward. Having failed to secure the votes to overturn Governor Wolf&rsquo;s veto, opponents are turning to the courts. They are not only asking the Commonwealth Court to invalidate the program, they are also seeking an injunction to prevent the rule from going into effect while the Court decides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s too early to predict what the court might do, but PennFuture agrees with the DEP, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, and the Independent Regulatory Review Commission. All found that the CO2 Budget Trading Program is authorized by the Air Pollution Control Act. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve also joined with other groups seeking the opportunity to speak for our membership and to make our case before the Court.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we believe this program is the right choice for Pennsylvania. &nbsp;We are facing a growing climate crisis. Ignoring our climate obligation is a recipe for failure. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rather than Fight, the Legislature Has An Opportunity to Be Part of the Solution&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Under the Air Pollution Control Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) can only spend auction proceeds on measures that reduce air pollution. This could include projects that address legacy pollution sources, investments in new clean energy, and many other needed programs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the Legislature were to approve a spending plan, the DEP could make even more targeted investments, bringing added benefits to frontline workers and impacted communities as well as our shared environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The RGGI Investments Act &mdash; SB15 (Comitta) in the Senate and HB 1565 (Herrin) in the House &mdash; proposes just that sort of program. The legislation would support workers and communities affected by the clean energy transition, investing specifically in frontline and environmental justice communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Good Climate Policy in Pennsylvania Has Been a Long Time Coming&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Pennsylvania was once considered a leader in climate policy. In 2004, Pennsylvania passed the Alternative Energy Portfolio Act which required, for the first time, electricity distribution companies to supply a certain percentage of alternative energy, including wind and solar power. In 2008, Pennsylvania passed Act 129, which required electricity distribution companies to reduce energy consumption through investments in energy efficiency in their geographic regions. Again in 2008, the legislature enacted a grant and loan program through DEP and the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) to support the installation of renewable energy projects. &nbsp;</p>

<p>But over the ensuing 14 years, Pennsylvania not only failed to update any of its climate legislation or re-invest in its renewable energy programs, it has actively tried to stop any efforts to cut carbon emissions. Those policies have effectively died on the proverbial vine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, Pennsylvania has reverted to its historic roots as a fossil fuel zealot, showering the fracked gas industry with subsidies and weak regulations, ignoring the plight of communities beset by pollution or the Commonwealth&rsquo;s role as one of the major climate contributors in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is what makes the RGGI rule so important. It&rsquo;s the first time in 14 years Pennsylvania has taken climate action. Certainly, the fight for the RGGI rule&rsquo;s long-term survival isn&rsquo;t over yet. The adherents to the philosophy of free pollution and an economy dominated by fossil fuels are still loud and active. But we hope that this is a turning point where we can put the doldrums of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s climate history behind us and begin building a clean, more prosperous future.&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture Celebrates Lake Erie and Introduces New Erie Campaign Manager During PA Clean Water Education Week,4/13/2022,"<p>PennFuture is celebrating its sixth annual PA Clean Water Education Week, dedicated to showcasing the Commonwealth&rsquo;s unique waterways and advocating for their health by ensuring sufficient state funding for protection and restoration initiatives. Throughout the week, we highlight each of PA&rsquo;s six major watersheds. Today we celebrate the Lake Erie Watershed!</p>

<p>There is much to appreciate about Lake Erie. The 11th largest lake in the world by surface area, Erie provides drinking water to over 11 million people basin-wide. Erie is the warmest and shallowest of the five Great Lakes and, subsequently, the most biologically productive and diverse. Lake Erie also presents a success story for clean water funding. Efforts of the 1970s, including the passage of the Clean Water Act and the multi-national <a href=""https://ijc.org/en/great-lakes-water-quality-agreement-turns-50#:~:text=There%20is%20much%20to%20reflect%20on%20as%20the,social%2C%20cultural%20and%20spiritual%20activities%20of%20Indigenous%20peoples."">Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement</a>, addressed unabated industrial pollution, agricultural runoff, and poor wastewater treatment that plagued Lake Erie. More recent funding from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative provided extra assistance for priority cleanup locations known as Areas of Concern, including Presque Isle Bay, which was deemed safe again and delisted in 2013. Consistent support from decisionmakers and dedicated clean water funding have allowed Lake Erie and Presque Isle Bay to become the thriving recreational, commercial, and cultural assets we know today.</p>

<p>In my first weeks with PennFuture in Erie, it became clear that many Erieites are proud of the improvements made to their lake and bay. However, we cannot take this progress for granted and must remain unified in our resolve for protection of these resources. Today, our lake faces complex challenges linked to climate change, surface runoff, invasive species, legacy and emergent industrial toxins, and pollution from the fossil fuel and plastics industries. Watershed residents in historically burdened communities, particularly communities of color, face compounding and disproportionate impacts from legacy contamination and other threats. For these reasons, we continue to advocate for the funding necessary to limit the impacts of our built and agricultural resources on water quality, to improve ecosystem and community resilience, and to foster an appreciation of these resources among all Pennsylvanians by ensuring everyone has access to outdoor amenities, including our lake.</p>

<p>Sufficient funding is essential for protecting Lake Erie and our watershed residents but is only one piece of a comprehensive approach requiring policy change and involvement from decision makers at all levels, businesses, academic institutions, and a diverse array of citizen advocates. I am thankful for the foundational work of our staff and community partners as outlined in <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/ErieCommonAgenda_6.pdf"">Our Water, Our Future: A Common Agenda for Protecting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Lake Erie Watershed</a>. In collaboration with twelve area environmental organizations, several resident scientists, and a cohort of social justice reviewers, PennFuture outlined this comprehensive framework needed to address water quality concerns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clean water funding remains a priority for the state budget season, but we must advance other aspects of the Common Agenda. Stimulus funds under the American Rescue Plan and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Acts create opportunities to fund many of our budget recommendations. These relate to stormwater management, renewable energy and electric vehicle infrastructure, orphaned and abandoned oil / gas well plugging, brownfield reclamation, and other commercial and neighborhood development efforts. We will advocate for watershed communities getting their fair share of these funds and for the prioritization of water quality and environment concerns in project implementation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recognizing the disproportionate impact of environmental issues and the COVID-19 pandemic on disadvantaged communities and people of color, we seek to ensure stimulus investments and other decision-making processes equitably benefit all communities and promote inclusive decision-making. This includes ongoing involvement in <a href=""https://blavity.com/how-a-pennsylvania-towns-community-revitalization-project-is-hurting-its-low-income-poc?category1=opinion"">litigation with PennDOT</a> and the US Highway Administration regarding the Bayfront Parkway reconstruction plans that lacked of proper environmental consideration in project design phases and will harm environmental justice communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New and improved policy at local and state levels will be essential to placing Lake Erie Watershed communities on a sustainable, long-term trajectory, particularly once stimulus funds are spent. PennFuture and our partners continue to focus on landuse policies that benefit water quality and human health, and legislative safeguards against industrial, fossil fuel, and plastic pollution. With collaboration and shared goals, the Erie region can set itself on a new path, recognizing environmental and human health need not be framed in opposition to economic prosperity. I welcome the input of diverse partners across all sectors as we work toward this vision for our watershed communities.&nbsp;</p>

Chasing the Rainbow: Carbon Capture is Magic Thinking,4/13/2022,"<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of discussion and excitement <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/carbon-capture-climate-change-iowa-rcna19572"">about the idea of carbon capture and storage technology.</a>&nbsp; Unfortunately, the excitement about the potential far outstrips the reality of the technology.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that we are living <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/"">through climate change</a>. It isn&rsquo;t a question of whether it&rsquo;s coming, it&rsquo;s a question of&mdash;pardon the pun&mdash;degree. We all see and experience the changing weather patterns, the increasing storms. Our parents&rsquo; stories of skiing and sledding throughout the winter in Philadelphia when they were children is nearly unimaginable now. The future is uncertain and often scary. In these dramatic circumstances, it&rsquo;s natural for us to reach for hope and to reach for dramatic solutions.</p>

<p>Carbon capture, also known more formally as &ldquo;carbon capture utilization and storage&rdquo; (and it&rsquo;s accompanying acronym &ldquo;CCUS&rdquo;), looks on its surface like exactly the hero we need. The idea behind it is tantalizingly simple: develop technology and systems that takes the carbon we&rsquo;re putting into the air with fossil fuels and simply puts it back into the ground where it came from. In theory, there are different ways to do this, ranging from startups that could develop bold new technologies, to simply identifying and accelerating natural processes that already happen, like planting trees. Carbon capture holds universal appeal: environmentalists see it as a way to restore the planet to sustainable CO2 levels, fossil fuel proponents see it as a way to continue their business without major disruption, and even non-experts can get behind the idea of something that gives us the best of all worlds.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is all magical thinking. Magical thinking is dangerous, because it lets us avoid the real, immediate challenges we are facing in favor of a solution that may never materialize. As a global society, we absolutely need to develop new technologies to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, not only is carbon capture not a silver bullet, it is distracting us from the technology we already have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We already have proven technology that is competitive on the free market: For instance, we know that solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources <a href=""https://ieefa.org/milestone-u-s-wind-power-second-highest-electrical-source-last-week/"">can work wonderfully</a> as part of a portfolio of energy sources. Battery technology has improved almost beyond imagination in a short time, with energy storage costs <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/"">declining 72% between 2015 and 2019</a>, and energy storage systems <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/"">increasing 27% from 2018 to 2019 alone</a>. These are real tools that we are already successfully using worldwide and that the USA is playing an important part in expanding.</p>

<p>By contrast, carbon capture is a technology that overpromises and underdelivers. Despite <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/carbon-capture-technology.html"">decades of development efforts</a>, carbon capture remains both extremely expensive, unproven to be able to work <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/2287551-inside-the-race-to-scale-up-co2-capture-technology-and-hit-net-zero/"">at the necessary scale</a>, and largely unable to meet its own projections of success. For one example, we could look at hydrogen as &ldquo;clean&rdquo; energy. What we really know is that hydrogen as a fuel source is really just a rebranding of an old frenemy, the oil and gas industry. So-called &ldquo;green&rdquo; or &ldquo;blue&rdquo; hydrogen is advertised as a new energy solution, better for the climate. In reality, the carbon capture systems at hydrogen plants have been shown to fall dramatically short, with terrible consequences. First of all, it&rsquo;s critical to know that hydrogen must have highly successful carbon capture&mdash;90% or more!&mdash;to be &ldquo;clean.&rdquo; However, <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blue-Hydrogen-Presentation_February-2022.pdf"">recent studies</a> have found that hydrogen plants that utilize carbon capture only have a success rate ranging from 48% to 77%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if (and it is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo;) carbon capture has a breakthrough, the better use for that technology would be to reduce our global carbon levels back down to more sustainable levels. The global temperature is rising: this technology should be used to mitigate the problems, not to try and put a band-aid over a bullet hole. But until that time, we have the ability to start work using the tools that are already at hand: strengthening our environmental protections, working with other states in the country and region to fundamentally reduce greenhouse gas release (such as through joining RGGI), and accelerating our use of renewable power.&nbsp;</p>

Pennsylvania House Asks: Could We Live Without Fossil Fuels? We Say: We Must.,3/31/2022,"<p>The only thing more destructive than the fumes from fossil fuels extracted in PA is the fumes of the trillions of taxpayer dollars up in flames by the constant shilling to fossil fuel boosters in the form of disinformation-laden hearings in our State Capitol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On March 28, 2022, the Pennsylvania House Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committee held an industry-friendly hearing titled &ldquo;Could We Live Without Fossil Fuels?&rdquo; Phrases such as &ldquo;natural gas and oil are essential to life&rdquo; uttered by Rep. Mike Armanini and &ldquo;we cannot go back to living like the colonials and Native Americans&rdquo; stated by both Chairman Daryl Metcalfe and panelist David Taylor polluted the air of the meeting room. Metcalfe asks in the title of this hearing &ldquo;could we live without fossil fuels?&rdquo; and the answer is not &ldquo;we could,&rdquo; &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; or even &ldquo;we should;&rdquo; but instead: we must.</p>

<p>The panelists, which were all (and only) representatives of the fossil fuel industry including the American Petroleum lnstitute (API), Marcellus Shale Coalition, Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association (PIOGA), American Refining Group, and Pennsylvania Chemical lndustry Council. These panelists were aided throughout the hearing by the majority chairman and his caucus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This hearing repeated tired, frequently-debunked talking points about the &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; of fossil fuel-based products in the American consumer&rsquo;s daily life. However, as Minority Chair Greg Vitali correctly pointed out, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/oil-companies-are-going-all-in-on-petrochemicals-and-green-chemistry-needs-help-to-compete-153598"">roughly 80 percent&nbsp;of each barrel of oil extracted</a> is used for gasoline or other fuel, while the rest goes to other petrochemical products such as those used in household items. Rep. Danielle Friel Otten and Rep. Joe Hohenstein also pushed back on the &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; of these products and assertions by the panelists that &ldquo;no viable alternative&rdquo; exists. With increased research and development, environmentally sustainable household products are increasing in availability and lowering in price. In regards to baby products, an area of much discussion at this hearing, there is no shortage of products that are <a href=""https://www.mother.ly/baby/baby-shopping-guide/eco-friendly-baby-care-items/"">both sustainable</a> and <a href=""https://www.poison.org/articles/dangerous-household-hydrocarbons"">actually safer</a> for mothers and their newborns than petrochemical based products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another heavy focus of the hearing was medical devices, and the current reliance on petrochemicals in their production. The panelists, aided by majority representatives, argued that &ldquo;viable alternatives&rdquo; do not exist to the current medical products. This is largely false, as <a href=""https://www.greenbook.org/mr/market-research-news/environmental-sustainability-healthcare-and-medical-devices/"">roadmaps and suggestions to manufacturing</a> more sustainable medical devices and products have existed for years.</p>

<p>However, what is lacking is larger-scale investment, development, and research which would lead to such products becoming less expensive and more widely available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rep. Bud Cook, a member of the majority, raised an interesting question &ndash; whether the panelists could speak to the perspectives of employees in the fossil fuel industry and how their work impacts the environment in which they live. Metcalfe quickly interrupted Cook, rephrasing the question to whether the panelists could speak to the &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; petrochemical based products used in fishing and outdoorsman equipment. PennFuture has long researched and written about the impacts of fossil fuel extraction on vulnerable, front-line communities including, but not limited to, rural and working-class populations largely served by members of the majority in Harrisburg.</p>

<p>In Rep. Cook&rsquo;s Washington and Fayette County constituencies, residents fall victim to <a href=""https://www.coalfieldjustice.org/blog/2019/8/5/statement-on-columbia-gas-explosion-in-washington-pa"">pipeline explosions</a>, <a href=""https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/thousands-gallons-gas-spill-into-washington-county-creek-neighbors-report-feeling-sick/DTFEFKNXANFGHLRPYUTYLG5C3M/"">gas leaks</a>, <a href=""https://www.alleghenyfront.org/cnx-pleads-to-criminal-charges-for-misreporting-air-pollution-in-washington-county/"">air pollution</a>, and <a href=""https://www.publicsource.org/rural-pennsylvanians-with-contaminated-water-potentially-from-fracking-feel-abandoned-by-state-regulators/"">water contamination</a> due to continued fossil fuel extraction. PennFuture also maintains the position that fossil fuels and petrochemicals are not the key to revitalizing regions that both Rep. Metcalfe and Rep. Cook serve. Alternative, <a href=""https://exclusive.multibriefs.com/content/green-collar-jobs-in-the-spotlight/facilities-grounds"">&ldquo;green-collar&rdquo; job opportunities</a> are growing worldwide and present <a href=""https://rmi.org/rmi-reality-check-appalachia-poised-to-become-clean-energy-country/"">enormous economic opportunities</a> for Appalachia, and instead of chasing a dying industry, Pennsylvania would be best served <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/greenstimulus"">leading the path into the new, green economy.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This hearing, at its basis, presents a false dichotomy: invest in fossil fuels or live like those in the colonial era. As Minority Chair Vitali aptly noted, &ldquo;that is ridiculous.&rdquo; As for the remark about Native Americans made by Metcalfe and some in the panel, Rep. Hohenstein made a noteworthy retort.

Philadelphia’s 2023 Budget Must Prioritize Clean Water for All,3/29/2022,"<p><a href=""https://c.tenor.com/QZNVDaVse9sAAAAC/looney-tunes-bugs-bunny.gif"">Duck season! Rabbit season!</a></p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s budget season!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are only days away from Mayor Jim Kenney&rsquo;s penultimate budget address to City Council and the annual push to fund numerous priorities. The good news? Philadelphia continues to recover from the economic turmoil brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The bad news? Philadelphia <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-budget-pandemic-revenue-down-mayor-jim-kenney-20220215.html"">continues to lag behind other major cities</a> in America in its recovery from the pandemic.</p>

<p>In a January <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTd5wWNrAM8"">town hall</a>, Mayor Kenney said: &ldquo;The budget is not just about numbers and spending. It&rsquo;s the representation of the priorities of our city&hellip;The budget takes our values and turns them into investments. And, turns our hopes and goals into plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A video presentation went further: &ldquo;The budget represents the City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s commitment to tackling its biggest challenges, including providing a safe and just city, health equity for all, and quality education for all Philadelphians. Amid all the charts and numbers of the budget is a core goal: to increase equity and opportunity so that you can reach your full potential regardless of what corner of the city you live in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, what are our values for the 2023 fiscal year? A survey helps shed some light on the city&rsquo;s priorities and preferences. These were the options to choose from:</p>

<p>Anti-violence;<br />
Neighborhood Services;<br />
Education;<br />
Business and Workforce Development;<br />
Arts and Culture;<br />
Infrastructure (Roads and Bridges);<br />
Support for Vulnerable People;<br />
Public Health;<br />
Public Safety; and<br />
Other: ______.</p>

<p>Attendees were encouraged to choose three priorities and provide their priorities in the chat if they selected &ldquo;Other.&rdquo; Not surprisingly, education was the top priority among attendees, followed by neighborhood services.</p>

<p>At first glance, the list of potential options encapsulates many, if not most, of the broad categories that require further investment. But if we take another look, there are issues. The list above makes no mention of climate or the environment. In fact, climate was not mentioned once during the virtual town hall that spanned approximately sixty minutes. The environment was not mentioned either. Unfortunately, <a href=""https://www.thegreencities.com/news/mayor-kenney-leaves-out-climate-change-out-of-his-budget-address/"">we&rsquo;ve seen this movie before</a> in Philadelphia as issues related to climate change and the environment are set aside during one of the most crucial periods of the fiscal year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To start, infrastructure isn&rsquo;t just roads and bridges &ndash; as one attendee astutely pointed out during the January town hall. In fact, Philadelphia <a href=""https://e360.yale.edu/features/with-a-green-makeover-philadelphia-tackles-its-stormwater-problem#:~:text=In%20a%20major%20initiative%2C%20Philadelphia,green%20America's%20fifth%2Dlargest%20city."">remains a leader</a> through its incorporation of green infrastructure like trees, rain gardens, and other natural elements to improve the local environment and increase public health.</p>

<p>We have also seen the annual reminder of the impact our aging water infrastructure can have on all of us <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/busted-water-mains-flood-philly-streets-as-city-fails-to-hit-pipe-replacement-goals/"">with another round of water main breaks</a> as the city&rsquo;s efforts to replace old pipes continue to fall short. As I&rsquo;ve written previously, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Its-Time-to-Reimagine-Americas-Infrastructure"">Philadelphia&#39;s water pipes are ancient</a>. The average age is approximately 73 years, and more than 800 miles of the city&rsquo;s mains are older than 100 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Massive water main breaks can be devastating for any community, particularly underserved communities that cannot afford to shoulder the cost of repairs to their homes and neighborhoods that can stem from a massive water main break, <a href=""https://6abc.com/south-philadelphia-water-main-break-queen-village-july-2021-6th-and-bainbridge/11658288/"">nor bear the delays</a> in restoring basic services to the impacted area. Part of Kingsessing <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/water-main-break-west-philly-kingsessing-56th-and-springfield-avenue-20220209.html"">recently experienced</a> a 48-inch break to a water main that was 100 years old. The main broke in early February and neighbors <a href=""https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/one-month-after-massive-water-main-break-residents-still-feeling-impact/3171770/"">are still suffering from the effects</a> more than a month later. One family said that it took several weeks to restore heat to their home, forcing family members to use a space heater to provide some warmth during cold winter months.</p>

<p>Councilmember Jamie Gauthier represents the neighborhood and <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/water-main-break-kingsessing-heat-electricity-20220218.html"">summed up the situation</a> in a written statement: &ldquo;Our most vulnerable residents should not have to shoulder the burden of the long-term failure of all levels of government to adequately fund the maintenance of Philadelphia&rsquo;s water infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mayor Kenney&rsquo;s budget address and the subsequent hearings in City Council present an opportunity for the city to clarify how it will do its part to properly fund efforts to update its creaking, groaning water infrastructure. PennFuture will be listening for spending proposals that will capitalize on the important work of the city&rsquo;s Green City, Clean Waters plan to utilize green stormwater infrastructure and green space to relieve some of the pressure on the city&rsquo;s water mains. We are also very interested to hear from the city how it plans to take advantage of new funding sources provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to help it fund this critical work and avoid millions of dollars in damages to communities that can least afford it.</p>

<p>Green City, Clean Waters has also provided opportunities for the city to create opportunities for workforce development through organizations like <a href=""https://powercorpsphl.org/"">PowerCorpsPHL</a>. Founded in 2013, PowerCorpsPHL <a href=""https://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/powercorpsphl-philadelphia/"">has helped hundreds of young people</a> gain access to career opportunities that were not previously available to them. Participants can earn an hourly wage while developing skills in areas that will help them succeed in the jobs of tomorrow through rebuilding and protecting our natural infrastructure. Green City, Clean Waters allows participants to receive training in the installation, repair, and maintenance of green stormwater infrastructure, which remains an industry <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Report-highlights-success-of-Philadelphias-Green-City-Clean-Waters-Program"">with enormous growth potential</a> and economic benefit across Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, PowerCorpsPHL has seen its city funding <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-gun-violence-programs-funding-20211227.html"">cut severely over the past several years</a> despite its strong record of providing employment opportunities to disconnected youth, reducing violence, and improving Philadelphia&rsquo;s natural environment. In fact, the city has cut its funding to PowerCorpsPHL from almost $1.5 million per year to less than $400,000 since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>PowerCorpsPHL remains a national model that reminds us of what is possible when we prioritize workforce development and training in 21st-century career paths with efforts to improve the urban environment. Prior to the pandemic, the program <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/power-corps-mural-arts-guild-philadelphia-youth-gun-violence-20201202.html"">was able to secure family-sustaining jobs</a> for 90 percent of its participants. It also provided an opportunity for youth and returning citizens to chart a path for themselves that would be free of the immediate threat of crime and violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The city recognized the program&rsquo;s success in helping to combat the rising tide of violence in Philadelphia when it awarded PowerCorpsPHL with a $550,000 grant because of last year&rsquo;s budget negotiations. This, however, must be used for the specific grant proposal and will not help sustain the program in doing the work that it has done so successfully since its inception. The city should use this budget season as an opportunity to restore its funding to PowerCorpsPHL to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>It is a clich&eacute;, but budgets are about our values. PennFuture&rsquo;s values during this budget season are simple:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Protect our most vulnerable neighborhoods from the impact of warmer, wetter weather, and an aging infrastructure through sustained investment in green infrastructure and green space;</li>
	<li>Ensure that the least fortunate among us do not have to bear the burden of preventable disasters like water main breaks; and</li>
	<li>Provide access to job opportunities for disconnected youth and returning citizens so that they can have access to careers that will provide for themselves and their families.</li>
</ol>

<p>We hope that Mayor Kenney&rsquo;s budget address and the subsequent City Council hearings will reaffirm the city&rsquo;s commitment to these values and demonstrate the city&rsquo;s ability to put its money where its mouth is.</p>

"PennFuture, Partners Halt Construction of Proposed Liquefied Natural Gas Plant in Bradford County",3/28/2022,"<p>PennFuture, representing our partners Clean Air Council and Sierra Club, secured a big legal victory on March 18 by obtaining a settlement that&nbsp; halts the construction of a proposed Bradford County Real Estate Partners (&ldquo;BCREP&rdquo;) Liquified Natural Gas (&ldquo;LNG&rdquo;) facility near the Susquehanna River in Wyalusing Township, Bradford County, in Northeastern Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In August, PennFuture and our partners appealed a second extension of the air pollution permit for the proposed facility issued by the Department of Environmental Protection (&ldquo;DEP&rdquo;) to the Environmental Hearing Board (&ldquo;EHB&rdquo;).&nbsp;In this challenge, we objected to the second extension on several grounds, including that DEP erred in granting the extension because BCREP had not commenced construction at the Wyalusing facility, as required by the regulations.&nbsp;Further, the second extension relied on outdated and inappropriate pollution control technology.&nbsp;We also objected to the second extension because the DEP relied on flawed analysis resulting in insufficient and erroneous air emission limits, and several other significant deficiencies as detailed in our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2021-8-26-Notice-of-Appeal-without-exhibits.pdf"">Notice of Appeal,</a> which may be found here.</p>

<p>The parties agreed that BCREP will not move forward with construction of the facility under its current air pollution permit and will allow the permit to expire on July 22, 2022.&nbsp;In return, PennFuture and our partners ended our appeal of the second extension of the air pollution permit.&nbsp;If BCREP wants to build this facility, the settlement requires them to go through the process of applying for and obtaining an entirely new air pollution permit from DEP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proposed Wyalusing facility would have processed fracked natural gas into highly explosive LNG for shipment by truck or train through Pennsylvania communities to a proposed LNG export facility in Gibbstown, New Jersey for transport to overseas markets. This proposed LNG export scheme would endanger the health of our communities and environment, increase fracking in Pennsylvania, and lead to the further entrenchment of the fossil fuel industry.&nbsp;If constructed under the current air permit, the Wyalusing facility would have been permitted to emit over a million tons of greenhouse gasses and hundreds of tons of other harmful air pollutants annually, contributing to both climate change and dangerous air pollution.&nbsp;To learn more about LNG and its dangers, please check out our LNG Blog Series:&nbsp; <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">LNG Blog #1</a>, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-2-Bomb-Trains-Through-Pennsylvania"">LNG Blog #2</a>, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-3-Protect-Northern-PA"">LNG Blog #3</a>, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-4-Liquified-Natural-Gas-Should-Not-Become-the-New-Bomb-Trains-to-Threaten-Our-Communities"">LNG Blog #4</a>, and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-5-Public-opposition-grows-to-proposed-LNG-shipping-terminals"">LNG Blog #5.&nbsp;</a></p>

"Fallacy, Fiction, and Falsehoods: Debunking the Fossil Fuel Industry’s Stance on Russia’s War in Ukraine",3/25/2022,"<p>On Feb. 24, Russia commenced its unprovoked and atrocious invasion of its neighbor Ukraine. It didn&rsquo;t take long for fossil fuel interests in the United States to exploit this geopolitical and humanitarian crisis for their own benefit, using the war to call for increased fracking, fast-tracked permitting, new subsidies, and relaxed environmental regulations here in America.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the industry didn&rsquo;t stop there. Nearly every day, there are&nbsp;news articles, social media content and opinion pieces from industry boosters who spread false narratives, myths and other fallacies, all in an effort to further pad the pockets of corporate polluters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a running list of some of the most egregious bad-faith arguments being put forth by the fossil fuel industry and their legislative champions in media outlets, accompanied by fact-checking of those arguments. Please continue to check back frequently, as we will add to this list as we come across new content.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Myth</strong></u>: In a recent Op Ed piece, state Sen. Camera Bartolotta made <a href=""https://observer-reporter.com/opinion/op-eds/op-ed-time-to-wake-up-to-consequences-of-energy-reliance/article_1133b352-9e2e-11ec-b123-1b698af81a81.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=user-share"">many false and disingenuous statements</a> about Pennsylvania&rsquo;s role in combating Russian aggression. Notably, Bartolotta said Gov. Tom Wolf &ldquo;banned natural gas development in the eastern third of the state&rdquo; and &ldquo;banned development of the state&rsquo;s own natural gas rights underlying publicly owned property.&rdquo; Finally, the state senator bluntly said &ldquo;the U.S. needs Putin&rsquo;s oil.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> There is a lot to unpack here. First, the Delaware River Basin Commission - which is composed of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and a representative from the federal government - <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2021/02/25/delaware-river-basin-commission-votes-to-ban-fracking-in-the-watershed/"">voted to ban fracking</a> in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion of the basin last year. Gov. Wolf is but one of many voting members of the DRBC, and did not act unilaterally when the agency banned fracking in the basin.</p>

<p>Secondly, Gov. Wolf&nbsp;did not ban fracked gas development on public lands in Pennsylvania. He <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2015/01/29/gov-wolf-bans-new-drilling-in-state-parks-and-forests/"">placed a moratorium on new drilling</a>, which is a huge difference. Prior to that moratorium, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Conservation and Natural Resources leased more than 250,000 acres of state forest lands in the Marcellus play, 65% of which hasn&rsquo;t been drilled (163,089 acres). The problem isn&#39;t availability of locations, it&rsquo;s the economics. The companies drill only when it makes economic sense, which it currently does not. Saying that Gov. Wolf &ldquo;banned&rdquo; drilling on our public lands is an outright lie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thirdly, the United States does not need Russian oil, as evidenced by President Biden&rsquo;s ban on Russian imports. Even before that ban, <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/explainer-happen-us-banned-russian-oil-83314181"">roughly 8% of U.S. imports of oil and petroleum products</a> came from Russia - a modest amount by any measure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> Europe, which is directly threatened by Putin&rsquo;s turn to war, has already come to the conclusion that an economy tethered to fossil fuels is highly unpredictable, costly, and dangerous&mdash;particularly when we factor in the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/climate/climate-change-ipcc-report.html"">impacts of climate change.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Europe is clamoring for our energy exports. Germany recently announced it is <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/germany-aims-get-100-energy-renewable-sources-by-2035-2022-02-28/"">accelerating its timeline to achieve 100 percent renewable energy</a>. The European Union is <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/02/23/russia-ukraine-eu-nordstream-strategy-energy/"">readying an initiative</a> to fast-track renewable energy projects and cut the continent&#39;s use of fossil fuels in half in eight years. And most EU countries are ahead of schedule in their renewable energy goals and are not slowing down. Clearly, fracked gas is not the answer.</p>

<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> In a March 8th <a href=""https://triblive.com/opinion/sen-gene-yaw-american-energy-key-to-undermining-putins-war/"">editorial in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a>, Pennsylvania state Sen.&nbsp;Gene Yaw said that &ldquo;renewable energy accounts for less than one third of global energy supply and remains notoriously unreliable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> This is wrong on two counts. First, renewable energy &ndash; which encompasses a huge range of sources, including wind, solar, and hydroelectric &ndash; is in fact equally reliable to other energy sources. No kind of power plant <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/rachel-fakhry/myth-247365-power-plant"">runs 24/7, 365 days a year</a>, and operating America&rsquo;s electric grid always involves managing variability of supply and demand at all times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, it&rsquo;s contradictory for Yaw to claim renewables are unreliable when he&rsquo;s talking about a fossil fuel supply that has proven to be - you guessed it - highly unreliable when it&rsquo;s controlled by a despot like Vladimir Putin. Fossil fuels have always been controlled by whichever country or political entity sits atop them, which leads to a great deal of volatility and weaponization of these products. Nobody owns the sun and wind. They cannot be manipulated or controlled for political or other gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> In a letter <a href=""https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/6902686E-7AEC-47F8-8C38-5010A3A352D4"">sent to President Biden on March 2</a>, the Senate Natural Resources Committee claimed that President Biden is responsible for soaring gas prices because of his hostile attitude toward the oil and gas industry, including a moratorium on drilling on public lands.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> President Biden is <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/01/27/oil-gas-leasing-biden-climate/"">currently outpacing</a> his predecessor when it comes to issuing drilling permits on public lands. According to <a href=""https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/new-data-biden-slays-trumps-first-year-drilling-permitting-by-34-2022-01-21/#:~:text=New%20Data%3A%20Biden's%20First%20Year,34%25%20%2D%20Center%20for%20Biological%20Diversity&amp;text=WASHINGTON%E2%80%94%20New%20federal%20data%20shows,first%2Dyear%20total%20of%202%2C658."">the Center for Biological Diversity</a>: &ldquo;the Biden administration approved 3,557 permits for oil and gas drilling on public lands in its first year, far outpacing the Trump administration&rsquo;s first-year total of 2,658.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not to mention that oil and gas companies <a href=""https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/oil-gas-industry-stockpiled-drilling-leases-before-biden-pause"">have thousands of leases on public lands</a> that are unused and inactive, which has nothing to do with President Biden, and everything to do with energy companies&rsquo; own business choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> In a recent Op Ed piece, U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis alleged that scaling up domestic oil and gas is <a href=""https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/596804-the-real-way-to-support-ukraine-is-to-flip-the-switch"">as easy as &ldquo;flipping the switch.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> Domestic crude oil production in the U.S. is at <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS1&amp;f=A"">historically high levels</a> with 2019, 2020, and 2021 exceeding production in all other years.&nbsp;Production of natural gas in 2021 also reached an <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_prod_sum_a_EPG0_FGW_mmcf_a.htm"">all-time high</a> both nationally and in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;Even if companies had the ability and desire to increase production&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/energy/us-oil-production/index.html"">it could take years before we see significant changes.</a> That&rsquo;s not likely given the fact investors <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2021/03/06/973649045/hold-that-drill-why-wall-street-wants-energy-companies-to-pump-less-oil-not-more"">are hesitant to pour more money</a> into companies that have underperformed in recent years.</p>

<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> Industry boosters are claiming that Pennsylvania is in a position to increase LNG production and exports to Europe, and say that <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/fracking-is-a-powerful-weapon-against-russia/2022/02/24/8bd49c56-95b5-11ec-bb31-74fc06c0a3a5_story.html"">&ldquo;fracking may be America&rsquo;s most powerful weapon against Russian aggression.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> Liquified Natural Gas&nbsp;exports reached peak levels in 2021 at just over 3.5 trillion cubic feet.&nbsp;Many European nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Netherlands, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, Lithuania, and Poland imported record high levels of American LNG. Because our infrastructure is already operating near capacity, meeting the demand in Europe required diverting production that would normally be sold into Asian markets. At this point, increasing exports to Europe will require major investments in infrastructure on both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp;Accomplishing this will take years and cost, potentially, billions of dollars. Furthermore, this assumes that Europe is looking to buy, but in fact, they are responding to this crisis <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-28/germany-brings-forward-goal-of-100-renewable-energy-to-2035"">by accelerating their plans to move to renewable energy.</a></p>

<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> In his &ldquo;End Russian Aggression Act,&rdquo; state Rep. Seth Grove <a href=""http://www.repgrove.com/News/26413/Latest-News/Grove-Calls-for-Increased-Distribution-of-Pennsylvania-Natural-Gas-to-Reduce-Reliance-on-Russia-"">has suggested that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s participation</a> in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is somehow connected to or impacted by Russia&rsquo;s war and oil and gas exports.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u>&nbsp;Under the RGGI program, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s electric generators burning fossil fuels will pay market-based emission fees for each ton of carbon pollution they emit.&nbsp;The proceeds from this program will be invested in cost-effective programs to reduce energy consumption and air pollution.&nbsp;The net result will be to help diversify our generation mix and lower both our dependence on fossil fuels and our exposure to a fossil fuel market Putin and others can manipulate. Simply put, RGGI has absolutely nothing to do with Russia or its oil and gas exports.</p>

<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> In <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/climate/climate-oil-crisis-global.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytclimate"">a March 10 article in the New York Times</a>, a fossil fuel executive&nbsp;acknowledges &ldquo;the need to tackle climate change,&rdquo; but said &ldquo;that effort should take a back seat to the more urgent need to increase fossil fuel production.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Action on climate change has been taking a back seat for decades, and this current moment is definitely not the time to backslide any further. The science backs up that claim:&nbsp;many of the impacts of global warming are now simply &quot;irreversible,&quot; <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60525591"">according to the UN&#39;s latest assessment</a>, and humans and nature are being pushed beyond their abilities to adapt. It&rsquo;s already well past time for humanity to break its addiction to fossil fuels, and the industry will always be looking for ways to stay relevant in a world that is increasingly climate-conscious.&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><u>Myth:</u>&nbsp;</strong>Weakening environmental protections will allow us to increase production and become independent of foreign oil.</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> The US is already operating very near its all-time peak level of crude oil production, with over <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrfpus1&amp;f=a"">4 billion barrels produced last year</a>.&nbsp;In spite of this near-record production, the US still imported more than 3 billion barrels of oil in 2021 with more than <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbbl_a.htm"">245 million barrels coming from Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Pennsylvania is also operating near its peak levels of oil production, but that represents a fraction of a percent of the national total <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrfppa1&amp;f=a"">with less than 7 million barrels produced in 2021</a>. The true path to energy independence lies in strengthening and securing our grid and reducing reliance on oil in the first place, not in rolling back the environmental protections that let us breathe, drink clean water, and enjoy the natural resources of our incredible state and country.</p>

"This year, Pennsylvania must properly fund efforts to clean up our waterways",3/22/2022,"<p>On Feb. 8, Gov. Tom Wolf delivered his eighth and final budget address in which he spelled out the top priorities and programs that need to be funded in the coming fiscal year. The speech marks the official kickoff of a budget process that will culminate with a new state spending plan by the end of June.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is absolutely imperative that this new budget includes the necessary funding needed to get Pennsylvania closer to our clean water goals, both here at home and in the Chesapeake Bay. Wolf&rsquo;s speech, after all, came only a few weeks after a new report that shows at least one-third of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways are so impaired and polluted that they are unsafe for wildlife, recreation and drinking water. Locally, over half of York County&rsquo;s waterways are impaired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simply put, our dirty water problem is getting worse in Pennsylvania, not better, and elected officials in Harrisburg have shown little appetite to properly fund the programs and initiatives that are needed to clean our waterways.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t continue to lose ground in the ongoing fight for clean water. That&rsquo;s why PennFuture <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/cleanwaterpetition/index.html?fbclid=IwAR33vmbJNrwO1i8CZYpdfHb-Lulev3e4IZ0NqCCwe4VqZivpwk84-AJxi5g"">started a new petition calling on our elected officials to take seriously</a> their duty and responsibility to bring about clean water, both for current and future generations of Pennsylvanians. The time is now for lawmakers to hear our concerns and to finally understand that properly funding clean water initiatives isn&rsquo;t just the right thing to do, it&rsquo;s the smart thing to do right now and for the future.</p>

<p>We all benefit from clean water in our waterways. The issue of polluted water in Pennsylvania is significant. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s insurmountable.</p>

<p>In 2010, Pennsylvania, along with five other states and the District of Columbia, voluntarily entered an agreement to clean up local waters and the Chesapeake Bay by the end of 2025. This commitment was reaffirmed in 2014 when the parties signed another agreement upholding their intent to meet the goals on time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What does that mean for Pennsylvania? In the Susquehanna and Potomac River watersheds alone, which account for roughly half of the state, the funding gap to clean up our polluted creeks and rivers will cost additional $325 million annually from what is already being spent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excess nutrients and sediment pollute our streams here in Pennsylvania and ultimately flow down to the Chesapeake Bay where they have a detrimental impact on aquatic life, including oysters and blue crabs. In Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion of the watershed, 15,000 miles of streams are polluted. In York County, there are 868 miles of polluted streams, roughly the same number of miles it would take to reach Daytona Beach, Florida. Key sources of this water pollution are runoff coming from farms, cities, and towns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has a long way to go to meet its goals. Since entering this agreement, the state has severely lagged behind in making progress, so much so that two lawsuits were filed in 2020 against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s failures, including one by the states of Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and the District of Columbia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is hope. The state just released an updated plan on how it will meet its goals by 2025. Almost every county in the watershed has a plan developed locally by community leaders and members. There are thirty County Action Plans that identify what needs to be done and the resources needed to accomplish the local goals. The estimated annual cost in York County is $26 million.It&#39;s now up to the General Assembly to do their part. Despite forward momentum to improve local waterways, time and time again our legislators fail to fully invest in our water resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This year our elected officials are out of excuses to kick the can further down the road. The state&rsquo;s coffers are projected to have over $1.6 billion in surplus plus a large infusion of billions of dollars from the federal government through the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, both passed last year by Congress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clock is ticking. There are less than four years remaining for Pennsylvania to meet its goals. In a recent letter to Pennsylvania, the EPA was clear that it is willing to take action if the state does not meet the federal government and increase funding.</p>

<p>We know that Pennsylvanians value their constitutional right to clean water and a healthy environment. Poll after poll demonstrates wide, bipartisan support for increases in state investments for clean water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our elected officials need to hear from you. That is why we are calling on Pennsylvanians to show lawmakers you care about clean water funding.</p>

"Russia-Ukraine Crisis: War, Fossil Fuels, and What it Means for Pennsylvanians",3/1/2022,"<p>Russia&rsquo;s war with Ukraine is underlining the economic and national security costs of relying on fossil fuels. Global reliance on limited, place-based fossil fuel resources, such as Russia&rsquo;s gas reserves, has become a tool of authoritarian leaders, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, to exert their global influence, regardless of its human and economic costs. How the world&mdash;including states like Pennsylvania&mdash;reacts to this global security crisis may dictate our energy future for years to come.</p>

<p>Russia bases its leverage on the world stage on its fossil fuel production and Western reliance on their supply, and is using this leverage to engage in military operations in Ukraine. The European Union <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy/bloc-2c.html"">relies on Russia for around 40 percent</a> of its fossil fuel supply. Global recourse against Russian aggression in Ukraine, such as military action or economic sanctions, could result in immediate energy consequences in Europe, potentially by Russia limiting supply, as well as global implications because fossil fuel prices will be (and already are) skyrocketing.</p>

<p>The sanctions recently announced by President Biden and other world leaders will begin testing Russia&rsquo;s fossil fuel leverage over the world. For its part, the United States has temporarily worked behind the scenes to ameliorate these energy concerns in the short-term by working with partner countries to increase liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to the European Union. In fact, the United States is now the largest exporter of LNG to the European Union. As a result, Germany, Russia&rsquo;s largest trading partner in Europe, was comfortable <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/22/germany-halts-certification-of-nord-stream-2-amid-russia-ukraine-crisis.html"">halting operation of the massive Nord Stream 2 fracked gas pipeline project</a>, an $11 billion pipeline designed to double the amount of gas flowing from Russia to Germany. However, as Russia&rsquo;s war with Ukraine continues, prices will continue to rise worldwide and our energy security problems will only deepen.</p>

<p>In response to Russia&rsquo;s war and western economic sanctions, what happens next will be telling. Russia may respond to harsher sanctions by suspending sales of fracked gas to the West. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/business/oil-markets-prices.html"">Outside of Europe</a>, Russia produces 10 percent of the world&rsquo;s supply, and 3 percent of the US&rsquo;s daily consumption of fracked gas. U.S. consumers have already begun feeling the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with nationwide gas prices <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/business/oil-markets-prices.html"">rising 20 cents on average</a> in the last month alone. <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2022/02/18/Pittsburgh-gasoline-price-rise-Russia-Ukraine-international-oil-markets-risk-premium-natural-gas/stories/202202170126"">In Pennsylvania</a>, as well, consumers have been facing rising prices due in part to the crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are also starting to see the fossil fuel industry <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/business/economy/russia-ukraine-energy-security-climate-change.html"">try and take advantage</a> of this global crisis. Gene Barr, President of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce, is calling for <a href=""https://triblive.com/opinion/gene-barr-its-time-us-energy-policy-stops-empowering-russia/"">state and federal policy changes</a> to allow for building more pipelines and export facilities&mdash;going so far as calling out advocates as well as environmental and safety regulations as being the equivalent of &ldquo;enriching Russia.&rdquo; Three Pennsylvania State Senators <a href=""https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2022/02/24/pennsylvania-lawmakers-urge-restart-construction-keystone-xl-pipeline/"">are advancing a resolution</a> calling on President Biden to restart the Keystone XL Pipeline&mdash;a pipeline that was canceled in 2020, which would have increased the capacity of transporting tar sands crude oil from Alberta, Canada, into the United States. And State Representative Seth Grove <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&amp;SPick=20210&amp;cosponId=36931"">is proposing</a> the End Russian Aggression Act to de-regulate fracking, expedite pipeline permits, provide new subsidies for pipeline construction, and end Pennsylvania&rsquo;s alignment with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, the recent completion of the Mariner East 2 pipeline to the Marcus Hook refinery and export facilities is now poised to increase LNG exports to Europe from the frack fields in Pennsylvania, creating an opportunity for the fossil fuel industry to argue for state policies that allow for more drilling with efforts to counter Russian aggressions.</p>

<p>The United States&mdash;and Pennsylvania&mdash;has a long-term choice to make. We could follow the playbook of the fracked gas industry, Rep. Grove, and other policymakers and drill, baby, drill to potentially send more LNG to market for overseas export (not for national markets) and raise energy prices further because of increased competition abroad. Or it could chart another path that doesn&rsquo;t rely on drilling, pipelines, and the whims of global energy markets by pushing for renewable energy sources.</p>

<p>The pro-climate change policies enacted at the state and federal level in recent months cannot be thrown off-course by fracking enthusiasts that are singularly driven by their profit margin. We certainly believe doubling down on the long-term reliance on fossil fuels in Pennsylvania in reaction to a global energy crisis caused by the Russian government cannot be further from the solution or the truth. Our energy policies must continue to have long-term, future generations in mind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, reliance on fossil fuels is not energy independence. In fact, we&rsquo;re not the only ones that think so&mdash;the European Union is paving a far different path forward than drill, baby, drill <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/articles/will-russia-spur-or-deter-europes-shift-to-green-energy/"">by hitting the gas pedal</a> on renewable energy.</p>

<p>The crisis in Ukraine has forced Germany, and the European Union as a whole, to reevaluate their complex relationship with the Kremlin and the dirty energy the EU consumes from them. The EU <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/02/23/russia-ukraine-eu-nordstream-strategy-energy/"">plans to unveil an initiative</a> in the next week that would fast-track the permitting process for renewable energy projects. European policymakers acknowledge they would be in a better spot if they had started more concerted work on building robust energy independence years ago, but they say that in some ways skeptics have needed this crisis to be kicked into action. In December, Germany approved $68 billion to accelerate its climate and green infrastructure spending.</p>

<p>It is past time that the United States, and our Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Its-Past-Time-for-Pennsylvania-to-Invest-in-Renewable-Energy"">embraces a renewable energy future</a>. A renewable energy future, in addition to being great for American workers, jobs, and our climate, would prove to be a better investment of America&rsquo;s resources and national security and serve as a robust alternative to further reliance on authoritarian dirty energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world looks different today to many&mdash;the post-World War II global alignment is threatening to be shattered by Russia&rsquo;s aggressions in Ukraine. But for many still, the world has also looked different because of the global insecurity and economic threat that is climate change. An energy crisis caused by Russian military action and weaponizing fracking is not an anomalous event&mdash;it&rsquo;s the latest in a constant drumbeat of natural disasters, fossil fuel infrastructure crises, and geopolitical threats sparked by a reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The United States&mdash;and Pennsylvanians&mdash;have a choice: continue the energy policies of fossil fuels&mdash; those causing public health and natural disasters&mdash;or charter a renewable energy path that breaks us from this cycle once and for all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chorus of voices from the fossil fuel industry will only grow louder in the coming weeks, all seeking the same handouts and weakened regulations. We should reject this chorus and not double down on the policies that have exacerbated this crisis in the first place. Europe is publically wishing it moved faster toward renewables. We shouldn&rsquo;t make the same mistake.</p>

Philadelphia Will Not Meet Climate Goals Without a Reconstituted Philadelphia Gas Works,2/23/2022,"<p>The future of energy in Philadelphia took center stage in mid-February during Philadelphia City Council&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLkEy4H-msY"">joint committee hearing on the Philadelphia Gas Works (PGW)</a> Business Diversification Study. Members of the Committees on Finance and Transportation and Public Utilities heard from city administration officials, PGW President and Chief Executive Officer Seth Shapiro, and advocates and stakeholders <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/media/20211207134817/PGW-Business-Diversification-Study-2021-12.pdf"">on the recommendations contained in the study</a> and how best to transition PGW away from its reliance on fracked gas.</p>

<p>Released in December 2021, the Diversification Study makes clear PGW&rsquo;s position as a gas utility and its desire to remain a gas utility. PGW has maintained that it believes gas will continue to play a central role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Philadelphia, as it did throughout the past two years while the study was ongoing. In fact, a straight line can be drawn from PGW&rsquo;s 2019 testimony during <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rgxvRKWbMk"">an earlier City Council hearing on this topic</a> to much of the findings and recommendations in the Diversification Study.</p>

<p>The study&rsquo;s third recommendation calls for a local decarbonized gas program where PGW partners with other City departments to convert waste into biomethane or renewable natural gas (RNG). Despite <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjbwwv/big-oil-has-a-plan-to-turn-appalachia-into-hydrogen-country"">big oil&rsquo;s big efforts</a> to ensure that RNG becomes the latest great hope to reduce carbon emissions while simultaneously continuing to promote an economy of extraction, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Renewable-Natural-Gas-Hope-or-Hype"">the future of RNG is more complicated</a>. As the study makes clear, RNG cannot play a significant role in reducing emissions in Philadelphia because it is more expensive to produce, does not contribute to air quality improvements, and it is limited in terms of commercialization or total availability. This recommendation should be shelved as RNG will not provide substantial aid in Philadelphia&rsquo;s climate pledges.</p>

<p>The study&rsquo;s second recommendation surrounding the use of geothermal energy carries the most promise. PennFuture strongly supports the pursuit of networked geothermal district systems to fully transition PGW from fracked gas. The conversation surrounding a potential geothermal energy future provided some of the most illuminating testimony during the joint hearing and could represent Philadelphia&rsquo;s best chance to significantly reduce PGW&rsquo;s emissions, provide protection for ratepayers from increasing costs as more households move away from fracked gas, and provide opportunities to PGW&rsquo;s workforce to maintain similar positions and even expand into new areas. But, we must move forward with all possible speed to complete any feasibility study and identify opportunities to quickly implement a pilot program.</p>

<p>Philadelphia will not achieve its climate pledges without a reimagined and reconstituted PGW. The joint hearing <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/kywnewsradio/news/local/philadelphia-gas-works-zero-carbon-goal-city-council"">further revealed PGW&rsquo;s ongoing reluctance</a> to do more than pay lip service <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/city-council-hears-options-for-decarbonizing-philadelphia-gas-works-divergent-visions-of-the-future-emerge/"">to this important conversation</a> while continuing to rely on oil and gas industry talking points. While PGW CEO Seth Shapiro does deserve some credit for stating his support for the idea of geothermal heat, this encouraging moment does not outweigh the balance of his testimony regarding the Diversification Study and PGW&rsquo;s role in supporting gas preemption legislation in Harrisburg.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are two points worth focusing on from Shapiro&rsquo;s testimony:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shapiro stated that it is irrefutable &ldquo;that natural gas is perhaps the most significant tool in greenhouse gas reductions.&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/30/18643819/climate-change-natural-gas-middle-ground"">Wrong.</a> In fact, this statement is directly contradicted by the Diversification Study, which says: &ldquo;Reaching the City&rsquo;s climate goals requires Philadelphia homes and commercial buildings to transition from natural gas to alternative sources of heating.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Shapiro pointed out that Pennsylvania currently produces a large portion of its electricity (40 percent) from fracked gas. While this may be accurate, it ignores <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">the various ways that fracked gas is subsidized</a> in Pennsylvania and how far public officials are willing to go to further deepen our reliance on fossil fuels like fracked gas.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Pennsylvania General Assembly has consistently sought to change the rules of the free-market economy to advance the interests of the oil and gas industry. The joint committee hearing <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/emails-about-pgws-role-in-energy-choice-bill-pit-councilmember-gym-against-utilitys-ceo/"">raised the latest method that lawmakers are seeking</a> to advance in Harrisburg: gas preemption <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=275"">through Senate Bill 275</a> and <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1947"">House Bill 1947</a>. These bills would ban municipalities across Pennsylvania from restricting or prohibiting utility services based on the types of energy they provide. It is being <a href=""https://www.vox.com/22691755/gas-utilities-fight-electrification-preemption"">pushed nationally by oil and gas industry groups</a> like the American Gas Association, which includes PGW as a member.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why would state legislation be raised in a local government hearing on a seemingly unrelated topic? Because PGW <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/pgw-emails-show-involvement-in-drafting-bill-that-runs-counter-to-climate-goals/"">has worked to support and strengthen</a> this dangerous legislation. Shapiro raised several points under questioning from Councilmember Helen Gym that require attention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shapiro stated that PGW is very concerned with the &ldquo;catastrophic impact of limiting energy choice.&rdquo; To be clear, this legislation only seeks to limit real energy choice by changing the rules of the game to counter market forces that are seen as a threat to the fossil fuel industry.</li>
	<li>He maintained that PGW is neutral on the bill. It is not. Former PGW executive Gregory Stunder provided substantive feedback on the bill and provided additional language to strengthen definitions contained in the bill.</li>
	<li>He denied that PGW provided line edits to the legislation. <a href=""https://media4.giphy.com/media/UVkisudp4aRFWA2ReE/giphy.gif?cid=790b76114a6e02f7bea9bd155ef54c827aa4694292bf08fc&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g"">It did.</a></li>
	<li>He repeated several times that PGW staff are subject matter experts and are obligated to provide feedback on legislation. This is nothing more than an attempt to ignore the real issue at hand: PGW contradicted the city&rsquo;s own stance on this legislation and worked to undermine the city&rsquo;s ability to achieve its climate pledges.</li>
</ul>

<p>As Councilmember Gym pointed out to Shapiro, definitions matter. The feedback matters. Shapiro mentioned several times throughout this testimony that we must look at facts and repercussions even though he used half-truths, obfuscations, and fossil fuel industry falsehoods in his defense of PGW&rsquo;s involvement with gas preemption legislation and its defense of the continued reliance on fracked gas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is good news, though! Gas preemption legislation recently hit a roadblock in the General Assembly despite the best efforts of organizations like the American Gas Association.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The state House of Representatives passed HB 1947 but was not able to garner enough support to override a veto from Governor Tom Wolf. This was a critical vote because it demonstrated that oil and gas champions within the General Assembly will likely be unable to pass this unnecessary legislation through regular order.</p>

<p>This would not have been possible without the hard work and advocacy from those who took time to reach out to their state legislators and voice their opposition to gas preemption and the disastrous consequences it will have on Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>There is more work to do, though, as the General Assembly will likely continue to seek out potential avenues to enact this legislation. As we saw most recently <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Plastics-Problem-More-False-Strategies-Statewide-Preemption"">with preemption efforts</a> to prevent municipalities from banning single-use plastic bags, gas preemption legislation could make its way into a fiscal code bill during state budget negotiations. Our work continues to ensure that this legislation is not enacted because those who support the legislation remain determined.</p>

<p>The oil and gas industry will continue to use all the power at its disposal to delay or deny Pennsylvanians the opportunity to have energy that is both clean and affordable. Fossil fuel insiders will continue to argue that they can drill and refine our way out of the worst impacts from man-made climate change, but natural disasters generated <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2022/01/10/us-natural-disasters-cost-145-billion-in-2021---3rd-costliest-year-on-record/?sh=288bcb5d4606"">approximately $145 billion in economic damage</a> throughout the United States in 2021. Pennsylvania suffered effects from the costliest natural disaster: Hurricane Ida.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are consistently confronted <a href=""https://www.vox.com/22912760/natural-gas-methane-rename"">with the language of denial</a>, deflection, and delay. There is time to act, but we must do so with speed and clarity. It will require the kind of innovation that so many called for during the joint hearing on the Diversification Study. Continued reliance on fracked gas &ndash; or its derivatives &ndash; will not help us.</p>

<p>We cannot afford to continue operating as usual as the toll from climate change grows ever higher. These are the facts and the repercussions, and we must face them.&nbsp;</p>

"During Black History Month, State Legislators Fighting Against Jim Crow 2.0 in Pennsylvania",2/15/2022,"<p>A generation ago my mother was born in &ldquo;Jim Crow-era&rdquo; North Carolina. A generation before that, my grandmother was prohibited from voting before the Voting Rights Acts was enacted. So, I grew up understanding that the right to vote is at the very foundation of our national identity, and that voting is both a right and a responsibility.</p>

<p>Now decades later &ndash; after the abolition of the poll tax, the end of lawful segregation, and the passage of landmark Civil Rights legislation &ndash; here we are: 2022 in Pennsylvania and that fundamental right that I had grown to respect and celebrate is still under attack.</p>

<p>Of course, poll watchers don&rsquo;t administer literacy tests or collect poll taxes, but new obstacles have emerged with a singular goal: voter suppression. Some hope that by making voting so onerous people will be discouraged from participating at all.</p>

<p><strong><u>Turning Back the Clock</u></strong></p>

<p>Pennsylvania had made significant gains in expanding access to free and fair elections in 2019 when Act 77 garnered bipartisan support and allowed no excuse mail-in voting. The timing was fortuitous because months later a worldwide pandemic struck that continues to impact Pennsylvanians&rsquo; daily lives. But because of Act 77, we could vote safely in the elections of 2020 and 2021.&nbsp; In fact, in the 2020 General Election, about 2.6 million Pennsylvanians used this safe and secure option to exercise their right.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>However, following the historic election of President Biden and Vice President Harris in 2020, the same lawmakers in the majority who approved of Act 77 in October 2019 sued to have it overturned, including mail-in voting. Why? Mail-in ballots were used more heavily by Democrats than Republicans. Lawmakers in the majority quickly concluded that curtailing access to mail-in voting was an easy way to stifle the vote in communities of color across Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>A judge on the Commonwealth Court recently handed down a decision that Act 77 is unconstitutional, however mail-in voting remains in effect while the matter is on appeal in the state Supreme Court.</p>

<p>This retreat from Act 77 is not an isolated incident, it is one example in a concerted effort to disrupt Pennsylvania&rsquo;s free, fair, and accessible elections and undermine the will of the voters.&nbsp; Other tactics include sowing doubt in the integrity of our elections, proposing new election reforms to erect barriers to voting (specifically in urban areas), advancing plans to permanently gerrymander Pennsylvania&rsquo;s congressional districts, and weakening our state&rsquo;s system of checks and balances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The House Democratic Caucus has been fighting these efforts every step of the way and have made <a href=""https://pahouse.com/policycommittee/defendingdemocracy"">Defending Democracy</a> a key tenet of our policy platform.&nbsp; We won&rsquo;t give up. Our democracy and the right to vote are too important. And we continue to make progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>One person, one vote</strong></u></p>

<p>Last year, as part of legislative redistricting, the Commonwealth took an important step in reversing the inequities of prison gerrymandering, which is the practice of counting people who are incarcerated as residents in the location of their correctional facility, not their home of record. The practice diluted the power of the vote for Black and Brown communities whose citizens are disproportionately incarcerated, while inflating the weight of a vote cast in districts hosting prisons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Treating people as permanent residents of their incarcerated location instead of their home community makes no sense, especially because those eligible to vote while incarcerated are required to register to vote and vote at their residence prior to confinement.</p>

<p>This is not a progressive or conservative issue. It is about fairness and &ldquo;one person, one vote.&rdquo; While prison gerrymandering reform was scaled back to only include people whose sentences expire before April 1, 2030 (the next Census) it is a step in toward improved equity in our elections, and as a result, more than 30,000 people &ndash; about half of a legislative district &ndash; will now be counted in their home community, not where they are temporarily housed.</p>

<p>Also, while we work to defeat bad policy ideas that would hinder voting and undermine democracy, we&rsquo;ve introduced our own plan - <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=2090"">The K. Leroy Irvis Voting Rights Protection Act</a> - to ease burdens on voting, bolster election security, and strengthen our democracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, it would make voting easier by permitting early voting, providing for more ballot drop boxes, and allowing same day registration, each of which has been adopted in other states. Next, the bill would make updates requested by our county election officials, like 21 days of pre-canvassing (where election officials can prepare mail-in and absentee ballots prior to Election Day). Finally, it would support election security by implementing statewide electronic poll books for secure real-time monitoring of election rolls, a practice currently used by nearly three dozen states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not the time to roll back the improvements we made to our election laws during the pandemic.&nbsp; We should be promoting options for safe and secure voting and celebrating people exercising their right. We need to be restoring faith in our election system and our local election officials, not sowing doubt in its results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We need to fight for our fragile democracy and renew our commitment to ensuring that every voice be heard.</p>

Updated Integrated Water Quality Report Reveals 33 Percent of Pennsylvania Waterways are Polluted,2/10/2022,"<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is inviting public comment on the most-recent Draft Integrated Water Quality Report (IWQR). As more waterways are evaluated, the report reveals that the state of our water resources is increasingly bleak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In accordance with the federal Clean Water Act, every two years, DEP updates the IWQR with the latest data on water quality from across the state. Between 2020 and 2022, the condition of 13 percent of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s 86,600 miles of streams were assessed, bringing the total number of surveyed waterways to 99 percent and 97 percent of public lakes.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/CleanWater/WaterQuality/IntegratedWatersReport/Pages/2022-Integrated-Water-Quality-Report.aspx"">draft 2022 IWQR finds</a> 33 percent of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s stream miles are impaired. That&rsquo;s a step backward from 30 percent in the 2020 IWQR. A body of water is considered &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; if monitoring data show the stream, river or lake fails to meet one or more water quality standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a stream or lake is determined to be impaired, in most cases, the DEP is required by the federal Clean Water Act to establish clean up plans, known as a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for pollutants that a body of water can receive while still meeting water quality standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Across the state, the top three sources of water pollution remain the same: acid mine drainage from abandoned coal mines, agriculture, and stormwater runoff from developed areas. Based on this report&rsquo;s newly assessed streams, acid mine drainage has replaced agriculture as the dominant source of pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The health of our rivers, streams, and lakes are assessed for four different categories of use: aquatic life, recreation, fish consumption, and public drinking water supply. Looking at all these uses, the IWQR shows that Pennsylvania is a state of water quality extremes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Southeast Pennsylvania has some of the highest percentage of polluted waterways. Nearly all the streams in Philadelphia and Delaware counties are impaired at 97 and 94 percent, respectively. These streams are highly modified and impacted by stormwater pollution, industrial waste, and combined sewer overflows. Montgomery, Chester, and Bucks counties make the top 10 list for percent impaired. To the southwest, Allegheny county, home to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s second largest city, has similar water quality impacts, and is not far behind with over 69 percent of streams impaired, or 915 stream miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Counties with the largest number of miles impaired contend with entirely different sources of pollution. Lancaster County has the most miles of impairment at 1,438 stream miles, or 89 percent, largely from widespread agricultural runoff. While in Elk County, the IWQR counts 1,126 miles of impaired streams (68 percent), caused largely by acid mine drainage, reaching the second highest number of impaired miles in a county.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A portion of northwest Pennsylvania is part of the Lake Erie Watershed with three other states and Canada. In Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion, nearly half (48%) of all stream miles are impaired, largely impacted by a mixture of both urban and agricultural runoff. Lake Erie itself remains impaired for recreation and fish consumption. More specifically, the fish consumption advisory in place for Presque Isle Bay is due to industrial polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) pollution.</p>

<p>However, not all of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways suffer from pollution. In fact, some of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.wordpress.com/"">most-pristine waterways</a> are found in the Poconos. In Wayne, Monroe and Pike counties, out of 3,642 total stream miles, only 815 miles are considered impaired (22 percent).&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, it&rsquo;s the home county of Elk State Forest that wins the ultimate water quality prize. Cameron County has 21 miles of impaired streams (3 percent), the smallest concentration in the state.</p>

<p>The IWQR contains some good news. Since 2004, about 920 miles of streams and 28,000 acres of public lakes have been effectively restored, showing that progress is possible. Since 2020 alone, 120 stream miles were found to be no longer impaired by pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IWQR is presented online as an <a href=""https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b9746eec807f48d99decd3a583eede12"">interactive &ldquo;story map,&rdquo;</a> and here are some things you can expect to find when you visit the IWQR:</p>

<p>Regarding stream health, key areas of interest in the IWQR include the changes between 2020 and 2022, the list of impairments known in the Clean Water Act as the 303(d) list, and what streams are prioritized for development of aTMDL or TMDL alternative. Most of the stream data can be viewed in map, table, or chart format.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the IWQR contains the 305(b) list that describes the overall status of our streams and the regulatory programs that Pennsylvania has in place to address poor water quality, such as agricultural and stormwater permitting programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DEP has provided additional information on statewide or regional restoration programs, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan, and data from statewide water quality monitoring sites for phosphorus, nitrogen, sediment, aluminum, and chloride.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Pipeline Problems Persist in Pennsylvania,2/7/2022,"<p>The fracked gas industry in Pennsylvania will never stop trying to convince us that pipelines are safe, efficient and necessary. Just look at <a href=""https://marcelluscoalition.org/2021/09/27/msc-responds-to-penneast-pipeline-cancellation/"">a press release that the Marcellus Shale Coalition released</a> in September, in which the group called pipelines &ldquo;the safest way&rdquo; to transport fracked gas, and that attempts to block pipelines &ldquo;will harm local, regional and national environmental progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They must not be living in current-day Pennsylvania, because even a cursory glimpse at local and regional news headlines tells a much different story about pipelines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture and other environmental advocacy groups <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-DEP-Should-Revoke-Permits-for-Troubled-Mariner-East-Pipeline"">have been vocal</a> about the doomed Mariner East 2 pipeline owned by Energy Transfer Partners, which has been plagued by dozens of spills, sinkholes and other accidents <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2021/12/06/mariner-east-builder-sunoco-agrees-to-4m-settlement-over-marsh-creek-lake-spill/"">that have destroyed our environment and natural resources.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To date, that pipeline project has been:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/mariner-east-pipeline-pennsylvania-crimial-charges-spills-20211005.html"">Hit with 48 criminal charges</a> from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Attorney General related to repeated environmental damages from construction of this pipeline.</li>
	<li><a href=""https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/state-charges-mariner-east-ii-gas-pipeline-owner-with-48-environmental-crimes/"">Hit with more than $20 million in fines</a> and penalties from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, including a $12.6 million fine in 2018 that was one of the largest ever imposed by the state DEP.</li>
	<li><a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/mariner-east-2/"">Hit with more than 120 violations</a> of state law for polluting wetlands, waterways, and destroying about a dozen private water wells.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that PennFuture has joined with several Pennsylvania lawmakers in <a href=""https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/berks/3-lawmakers-call-for-dep-to-halt-mariner-east-2-permits/article_924f1f78-3770-11ec-bad0-6790e8142049.html"">calling for the permits for this project to be revoked</a>. There are literally more than 100 examples of how this project is a <a href=""https://patch.com/pennsylvania/westchester/mariner-east-pipeline-called-nuisance-chesco-d-s-lawsuit"">public nuisance</a>, and Energy Transfer has shown us - time and again - that it lacks the ability to operate within the bounds of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is offensive and perplexing that this project has been allowed to proceed. But what&rsquo;s even more offensive is that 48 criminal charges apparently aren&rsquo;t enough for Energy Transfer to get its act together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other side of Pennsylvania, in Beaver County,&nbsp;Energy Transfer built the Revolution Pipeline, a 40-mile line that transports fracked gas between two processing plants. You might remember this pipeline as the one that exploded in 2018, causing a massive fireball that burned down a family&rsquo;s home, in addition to a barn and several cars, and caused widespread destruction of a nearby forested area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it was announced this week that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Attorney General filed an additional <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/story/news/2022/02/02/energy-transfer-criminally-charged-revolution-pipeline-explosion/6637877001/"">9 criminal charges against Energy Transfer</a> in relation to the Revolution Pipeline explosion, the company responded that it was <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2022/02/02/Energy-Transfer-grand-jury-environmental-crimes-Revolution-natural-gas-pipeline-explosion-Beaver-County-2018/stories/202202020133"">&ldquo;no surprise to us.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Sadly, it was no surprise to us either. It was no surprise when the DEP hit Energy Transfer with another $30 million fine related to Revolution, and it is no surprise that this company has been allowed to put the Revolution Pipeline back in service despite hundreds of violations from the state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When is enough enough? Has this company not shown us that it cannot operate safely in Pennsylvania? Will state regulators finally get the message after the next pipeline explosion, sinkhole or spill? When will the DEP step up and take seriously its duty to protect our environmental rights?&nbsp;</p>

<p>So remember: next time groups like the Marcellus Shale Coalition tell you pipelines are safe and necessary, don&rsquo;t believe them. The evidence is right in front of us to the contrary.&nbsp;</p>

Terrible Excuses to Mine Bitcoin,1/25/2022,"<p>A person using the pen name &ldquo;Satoshi Nakamoto&rdquo; <a href=""https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"">released a paper in</a><a href=""http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"">&nbsp;2008</a>&nbsp;introducing Bitcoin in an attempt to solve a problem with internet commerce:&nbsp; trusted third-parties needed to mediate online transactions resulted in increased costs and eliminated the anonymity buyers have when using cash.&nbsp;In Satoshi&rsquo;s plan, we could avoid these problems by replacing trusted third parties with cryptographic security&mdash;basically just math.</p>

<p>What Satoshi envisioned was more than just Bitcoin.&nbsp;He proposed a way to make a shared online ledger where anyone can record data like financial transactions in a way that can&rsquo;t be edited after the fact. This is known as a &ldquo;Blockchain&rdquo; and bitcoin are the reward for creating a new block in the chain.</p>

<p>While Satoshi&rsquo;s math works, and the invention has potential uses, there is an underlying flaw.&nbsp;The &ldquo;proof of work&rdquo; mechanism that controls how and when new blocks are added to the blockchain is very energy intensive and wasteful by design.&nbsp;Currently, the network <a href=""https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index"">uses over 15 gigawatts of energy</a>&mdash;in other words, the network as a whole consumes more energy than the average Pennsylvania household uses in 40 years for each Bitcoin it creates.&nbsp;With most of that energy coming from polluting fossil fuels, that results in an enormous amount of pollution including climate destroying greenhouse gases.&nbsp;It doesn&#39;t need to be this way&mdash;Satoshi picked one way of regulating how Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain operates, but there are alternatives that can do everything that Bitcoin can do without being nearly as energy intensive.</p>

<p>Moving to a more efficient &ldquo;coin&rdquo; than bitcoin will be challenging. As the first cryptocurrency to be introduced, it has inertia in the market that will be challenging to overcome.&nbsp;The system also has powerful supporters among people who sell energy&mdash;particularly the fossil fuel industry&mdash;who like the idea of a new industry that heavily relies on their product.</p>

<p>On January 20, 2022 the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on <a href=""https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-cleaning-up-cryptocurrency-the-energy-impacts-of-blockchains"">&ldquo;Cleaning up Cryptocurrency: the Energy Impacts of Blockchain.&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;While the Committee and the panel of speakers made some good points and accurate observations, the hearing also provided a platform for several pro-bitcoin boosters to repeat really bad arguments in favor of wasteful crypto-mining.&nbsp; Below is a quick review of some of the bad arguments the committee didn&rsquo;t challenge:</p>

<p><u>I&rsquo;d gladly pay you Tuesday for a Hamburger Today</u></p>

<p>Polluting industries often claim they use fracked gas now, but sometime later they will voluntarily switch to hydrogen, install carbon capture, or otherwise stop polluting.&nbsp;Bitcoin is no exception with claims that it will eventually clean itself up. Even if that happens (and there is no guarantee it will) energy will still be wasted.&nbsp;If we adopt a cleaner alternative to Bitcoin instead, we can still get all the benefits of blockchain technology while we use the clean energy for other priorities or reduce consumer prices because supply exceeds demand.</p>

<p><u>Wasting energy is good for [reasons]</u></p>

<p>A recent claim noted that using fracked gas for mining Bitcoin is a &ldquo;better&rdquo; choice than flaring it, but that is a strawman argument.&nbsp;An even better choice is investing in energy efficiency and clean renewable generation so we don&rsquo;t have to frack the gas in the first place.&nbsp;Even if one concedes some fracking is inevitable, the flaring might not be.&nbsp;More stringent regulations of fracked gas emissions and leakage can often solve the flaring problem.</p>

<p>A similar spin on this argument is to say that mining Bitcoin could &ldquo;absorb wasted clean energy.&rdquo;&nbsp;It is true that some areas with very high levels of clean generation have seen days with so much generation that electric prices go negative and people are literally paid to take it.&nbsp;Getting paid to use energy would be a good deal, but Bitcoin miners aren&rsquo;t going to spend huge amounts of money on mining hardware with a useful life measured in months and then sit idly by waiting for such an opportunity.</p>

<p><u>Look! A Squirrel!</u></p>

<p>Bitcoin miners will rely on distraction tactics such as redefining &ldquo;value&rdquo; to claim Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t actually wasteful after all.&nbsp;For example, some have claimed that because they use Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are heavily optimized for their job, they can crunch numbers much more efficiently than the more general-purpose machines that fill the average corporate data center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>An ASIC may be the most efficient way to do one particular calculation 100 trillion times every second, just like using a single enormous mining truck may be the best way to move 400 tons of dirt around a mine.&nbsp;But, if you can accomplish the same job without moving 400 tons of dirt, you can&rsquo;t really call the giant truck an efficient choice.&nbsp;Similarly, if you don&rsquo;t really need to do 100 trillion calculations per second, being able to do that better than anyone else is pointless.</p>

<p>Another distraction tactic relies on redefining pollution. In this case, a company PR department will promote the fact that they are complying with required environmental permits, or have installed emissions control systems, thereby implying that they aren&rsquo;t polluting.&nbsp;It should be obvious that doing the minimum required by law to reduce pollution isn&rsquo;t the same as being clean&mdash;cars have emissions controls too, but we know not to run the engine in a closed garage.</p>

<p><u>Greed is Good</u></p>

<p>Another way of redefining value is to argue that miners are not being wasteful if they are producing something people are willing to pay for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is undoubtedly a lot of money invested in Bitcoin. At the time of this writing, the Market Cap of Bitcoin was over $700 billion.&nbsp;Compared to corporations, that is only exceeded by&nbsp;Apple, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Tesla, and Meta (Facebook).&nbsp;Is Bitcoin really worth $700 billion, or is it a giant speculative bubble&mdash;the modern version of the seventeenth-century <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania"">dutch tulip mania?</a></p>

<p>Famous value investor Warren Buffet, who&rsquo;s own company Berkshire Hathaway falls just below Bitcoin on the Market Cap list, once said &ldquo;If you buy something like Bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don&#39;t have anything that is producing anything. You&rsquo;re just hoping the next guy pays more. And you only feel you&#39;ll find the next guy to pay more if he thinks he&#39;s going to find someone that&#39;s going to pay more.&quot; Buffet&rsquo;s vice chairman Charlie Munger was more concise and compared Bitcoin <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bitcoin-is-rat-poison-berkshires-charlie-munger-says"">to &ldquo;rat poison.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Blockchain technology has some interesting use cases, but there are thousands of chains to choose from ranging <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2019/01/what-is-a-corporate-blockchain/"">from serious corporate platforms</a> to <a href=""https://dogechain.info/"">jokes that took on a life of their own</a>.&nbsp;Bitcoin may use a blockchain, but it&rsquo;s not the only game in town, and countless other blockchains that can do everything Bitcoin&rsquo;s can do if not more. Except for name recognition, it&rsquo;s hard to see any value unique to Bitcoin nevermind anything worth $700 billion.</p>

<p>Even if Bitcoin could justify its market capitalization, using that as the measure of its value is deeply problematic.&nbsp;Mining Bitcoin is causing pollution that harms public health and exacerbates the climate crisis. Not counting the negatives when you talk about value only gives you half the picture.</p>

<p><u>So, where do we go from here?</u></p>

<p>The first step should be to end subsidies for bitcoin mining that come out of the pockets of Pennsylvania ratepayers and taxpayers. This is the easiest and most common sense solution to tackle this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, we need to educate policymakers and investors about the energy and environmental impacts of bitcoin. Hearings like the one held recently in Washington, D.C., are a good first step, but we need much more than that, both federally and here in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, finally, we need to move away from &ldquo;proof of work&rdquo; cryptocurrencies that are wasteful by design. Bitcoin relies on solving a difficult and energy-intensive math problem to create a new block in the chain, but that isn&rsquo;t necessary and isn&rsquo;t compatible with environmental and climate goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simply put, bitcoin mining has proven to be wasteful and dirty, and that likely won&rsquo;t change any time soon.

Introducing PennFuture's New Legal Interns!,1/24/2022,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognized that we need to be more involved with cultivating the legal talent that will continue to support our mission. Our attorneys have a long history of mentoring legal interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor law students interested in making a difference for our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting the State as well as to further their potential careers in environmental law. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.</p>

<p>This spring semester, we have a fantastic group of law students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We&rsquo;ve asked our new legal interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</p>

<p><u><strong>Cassidy Mason is a third-year law student at Widener Commonwealth School of Law</strong></u></p>

<p>My environmental law career began to sprout during my undergraduate studies. I graduated magna cum laude from West Chester University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Political&nbsp;<img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/cassidy.PNG"" style=""width: 150px; height: 150px; float: right;"" /> Science and a minor in Law and Government studies in 2019. I was the founder of Undivided, a diversity club on campus. I also was a founding sister of Theta Omicron chapter of Kappa Delta, a&nbsp;&nbsp;member of pre-law society, and an honors college graduate. I have had the honor of earning a Green Dot certification in 2017 and I am also a proud recipient of the Nobel Peace Leadership Series of 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;While in my undergrad career, I worked as an intern for Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania. It was in this experience that I learned it is very important to elect those who are champions for our environment. While in this position, I helped create environmental-friendly political campaigns and agendas. I also canvassed many areas across multiple counties in Pennsylvania to bring awareness to voters about current environmental and social issues.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prior to joining PennFuture, I took a seminar course on environmental sustainability at Widener Commonwealth School of Law. It was in this course that I realized I too wanted to become a champion for our environment. I am particularly interested in climate change, air quality issues, and the protection of humans and animals on this planet. I am very excited to be interning with PennFuture this spring and I look forward to helping to create a legal space that puts our environment first.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Sean Peterson is a third-year law student at Widener Commonwealth School of Law&nbsp;</strong></u></p>

<p>I have had a long standing interest in the environment and renewable energies since I was in high school where I actually started in the STEM field. For my senior project I studied the process of&nbsp;<img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/sean.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 150px; float: right;"" /> thermochemical biomass gasification (creating a renewable combustible fuel from compost or other carbon based garbage/waste) and built a gasification chamber. This led me to pursue an Electrical Engineering major for my first year of undergraduate studies. It was not until my freshman year at Montana State University that I discovered I wanted to attack the environmental issue from the law and policy side of things. At that point I switched my major from Electrical Engineering to Political Science and Economics and held a strong focus in my classes on natural resources and environmental issues.</p>

<p>After graduation from Montana State I came to Harrisburg, PA to work towards my law degree at Widener Commonwealth School of Law. I hope to graduate in May being only the second person to get all three governmental law certifications (as they are now), which include Administrative, Legislative and Environmental certificates. I hope to do so with honors in all three certificates. Additionally, I am an Honorable Patrick J. Murphy Fellow through the Law and Government Institute and am the president of the Law and Government Student Society on campus. In pursuit of the environmental law certificate in particular I have taken courses in sustainability and municipal law in order to give me a good background on what it takes to work in the field of environmentalism on the local level. The sustainability course specifically had me writing an ordinance from scratch for the Pennsylvania State Association of Boroughs on the incentivization of microgrids throughout Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>I have always known that environmentalism is the cause I wanted to fight for and I am so excited to be able to work for an organization like PennFuture. I can&rsquo;t wait to be able to soak up all the knowledge and experience they have to share with me!</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Religious Studies. This May, I will be graduating from Pitt Law with a concentration in Environmental and Energy Law. At Pitt,&nbsp;<img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/rachel.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 150px; float: right;"" /> I&nbsp;have worked with the Environmental Law Clinic for two semesters to help groups and individuals that could not otherwise afford legal representation with environmental issues in Western Pennsylvania. Additionally, I am the Treasurer for Pittsburgh&rsquo;s Legal Income Sharing Foundation, which aims to spread public interest awareness throughout the school and to give students scholarships to pursue public interest internships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to joining PennFuture, I interned with the U.S. Army JAG Corps at Fort Drum and Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services, a nonprofit environmental law firm. Additionally, I externed with the U.S. Department of the Interior, Solicitor&rsquo;s Office in Pittsburgh for two semesters. I also was a research assistant where I examined the regulatory scheme of Pakistan&rsquo;s circular economy. My experiences since coming to law school have cemented my desire to advocate for our environment. I am particularly interested in access to clean water and protection of wildlife, and am thrilled to be interning with PennFuture this semester!</p>

PennFuture Asks PA Supreme Court to Protect Pennsylvanians’ Groundwater and Environmental Rights,1/19/2022,"<p>In 1736, Benjamin Franklin coined the phrase: &ldquo;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&rdquo; This proverb remains as true today as it did in the earliest days of the Commonwealth, and is a foundational idea to the state constitution&rsquo;s Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA): The Commonwealth, and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), must look ahead into the future when it comes to environmental impacts, and consider what the outcome of something is going to be down the line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was the critical idea in the amicus&mdash;or &ldquo;friend of the court&rdquo;&mdash;brief that PennFuture, with several key allies, <a href=""https://johndernbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-1-13-FILED-Amicus-Curiae-Brief-78-MAP-2021.pdf"">filed before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on January 14, 2022</a>. PennFuture argued that the state&rsquo;s ERA requires the DEP to consider the environmental impacts of its decisions and the permits it grants ahead of time, and not just rubber stamp projects and hope they will get cleaned up later. It is common sense that sometimes the best way to fix a mess is to never create it in the first place, and that is especially true for environmental problems. Taxpayer dollars, environmental impact, human and environmental health, and the potential for unforeseen consequences matter. Unfortunately, the DEP did not think about these things, so PennFuture wrote a brief explaining to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court why it should have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, which kicked off in 2003, the company Gibraltar Rock had proposed to locate a rock quarry in the township of New Hanover in Montgomery County. The problem is that the quarry is right next door to a hazardous site that has contaminated the local groundwater with a number of compounds that are dangerous to people and the environment alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2005, the DEP issued a mining permit to Gibraltar Rock. The DEP, it should be said, has a program separate from the mining program that is specifically for the cleanup of contaminated sites like the one in New Hanover. That program already was well aware of the state of the hazardous site and the contaminated groundwater in New Hanover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One might assume that the DEP would coordinate these programs, since it oversees both. One would be wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, when local citizen groups and the township ultimately appealed the permit to the Environmental Hearing Board (EHB), the EHB found that the DEP&rsquo;s supposed coordination over the years was &ldquo;essentially meaningless,&rdquo; and that the DEP had simply &ldquo;failed to give the matter any serious thought.&rdquo; After a hearing that lasted for four days, the EHB found that quarry mining would not only be likely to make groundwater contamination worse, but it would create new contamination of previously clean water! In the end, the EHB found that the DEP did not do its job on several fronts. First, it did not make sure that the quarry met the most basic requirements of the mining law. Second, the DEP did not do its constitutional duty to consider what would happen to the environment if the quarry opened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quarry appealed, and the case next went to the Commonwealth Court. The Commonwealth Court chose to ignore the detailed, 84-page facts and analysis of the EHB. Instead, in a surprise twist, the Commonwealth Court wrote that the quarry company had agreed to clean up the groundwater&mdash;which was incorrect&mdash;and then overturned the EHB opinion. The case is now at the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</p>

<p>PennFuture and our allies wrote a &ldquo;friend of the court&rdquo; brief to ensure that the Supreme Court understands what is at stake here. The Commonwealth Court opinion is contrary to years of Supreme Court precedent, and if it stands, could lead to a huge rollback of environmental protection. We argued three main points:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>That the DEP has a duty under the ERA to consider in advance the environmental impacts of its decisions, even when they are impacts involving another DEP program;</li>
	<li>The EHB properly decided the DEP failed to comply with its ERA duty to consider groundwater pollution impacts from the nearby contaminated site, and;</li>
	<li>That the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s opinion on the ERA issue is inconsistent with the Supreme Court&rsquo;s prior ERA decisions and unsupported by the record.</li>
</ul>

<p>The brief was filed on behalf of Professor John Dernbach of the Environmental Law and Sustainability Center at Widener University Commonwealth Law School, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, Green Amendments for the Generations, and the Clean Air Council.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The case is Gibraltar Rock, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, which has two docket numbers; there is an identical brief filed in each. We will be sure to keep you in the loop as soon as there is new information pertaining to this case.</p>

As PennFuture <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Stakeholders-Making-Progress-on-Chesapeake-Bay-Goals-but-Legislature-Still-Lagging"">has written in the past</a>, the amendment shows that DEP and the counties within the watershed have stepped up to the plate and taken action, leaving the legislature responsible for holding back the state&rsquo;s progress.</p>

<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-review-amended-pennsylvania-plan-help-restore-chesapeake-bay-local-waters"">press release acknowledges</a> as much and says the agency is considering tough action if the amended plan fails to meet its goals or provide confidence that the state will meet its goals. The agency also stated that further actions, such as greater federal oversight of permits or increased inspections and enforcement actions, could occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>EPA&rsquo;s press release calls out a recent letter it sent to Pennsylvania that specifically points to legislative actions that must occur for the state to meet clean water goals, like a dedicated state agriculture cost share program or requirements for stream buffers or fencing to keep animals from accessing streams.</p>

<p>This amendment is the latest in a series of efforts to reach clean water goals here at home, but also in the Chesapeake Bay. To better understand this issue, we first must dive into the history behind these efforts to connect the dots to where we are now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>The Problem</u></p>

<p>The Susquehanna River provides half of all the freshwater that flows into the Chesapeake Bay, and there are more than 15,000 miles of polluted streams within Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portions of the Susquehanna and Potomac River Basins alone. Simply put, that means that Pennsylvania plays a big role in combating pollution in the Chesapeake Bay solely because of the amount of pollution we send into the Bay.</p>

<p>Both water quality and aquatic life in the Bay suffer because of excess nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment. Pollutants from the watershed are carried down to the Chesapeake Bay where they impact water quality and aquatic life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Algae feed off excess nutrients in greater numbers, starving streams of oxygen and killing off aquatic species. This lack of oxygen creates even more significant problems in the Bay&mdash;large dead zones where life cannot be sustained. Excess nutrients and sediment also cloud the water, suffocating oysters and bottom dwelling life while impacting underwater grasses, a critical habitat for blue crabs and other life in the Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>What&rsquo;s Being Done About it</u></p>

<p>In 2010, Pennsylvania and the other watershed states (including Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, New York, and West Virginia) and the District of Columbia voluntarily entered the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) with set pollution goals to be accomplished by the end of 2025. The Chesapeake Bay TMDL established strict limits on nutrients and sediments entering the Chesapeake Bay, and tasked each watershed state with reaching a certain amount of pollution reduction, in proportion to the pollution it added to the Bay. Each Bay state developed its own roadmap for meeting those pollution reduction goals, which are known as Watershed Implementation Plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These plans are developed with guidance and in coordination with the federal Environmental Protection Agency. This planning process was broken up into three phases, and states entered the final phase, or Phase 3, in 2019 when Pennsylvania&rsquo;s final Watershed Implementation Plan was submitted to EPA. The Phase 1 and Phase 2 Watershed Implementation Plans were submitted in 2011 and 2012, respectively.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Phase 3 WIP failed to meet previously-agreed upon goals to limit nitrogen pollution and, in response, <a href=""https://www.bayjournal.com/news/policy/epa-hit-with-lawsuits-over-chesapeake-bay-cleanup/article_db7ad7e0-f429-11ea-833a-87109c15a521.html"">two lawsuits were filed against EPA</a> for these shortcomings, including one from the states of Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. That brings us to the current situation, wherein Pennsylvania&rsquo;s DEP submitted an amendment to the EPA which rectifies the nitrogen shortfalls.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>The Amendment</u></p>

<p>The good news is the amendment gets Pennsylvania to meet 100% of our nitrogen goal. The 2019 Phase 3 WIP fell short by 9.8 million pounds in addressing nitrogen reductions. The nitrogen gap has been solved by efforts at the county level to establish County Action Plans, or CAPs, a critical component to successful implementation.</p>

<p>The bad news is that, since 2010, Pennsylvania has consistently fallen significantly short of meeting our clean water goals, and lawmakers in Harrisburg have shown little appetite in properly funding the programs and agencies tasked with achieving our clean water goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The decision to shift planning efforts to the county level occurred during the Phase 3 WIP development process, as Pennsylvania was asked by EPA to show how the state will meet its 2025 goals at the local level. To support local efforts, DEP developed the Community Clean Water Planning Guide and each county planning team received county specific planning tools, templates, a customized technical toolbox, and technical support resources.</p>

<p>Starting with just four pilot counties during the development of the Phase 3 WIP, now there are a total of 34 County Action Plans that were established at the county level by local leaders and stakeholders that identify the practices and resources needed to improve their local waters and achieve their target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nine counties do not have a CAP because they are considered &ldquo;minimal loading&rdquo; counties. DEP determined these nine counties will be able to achieve necessary nutrient reductions by continuing to implement their existing programs and practices without a CAP. Most of these counties are located at the edge of the watershed with only a fraction of the county falling within the watershed boundary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To further ensure success with county level planning efforts, the DEP recognized the need for coordinators to facilitate and track planning and implementation. In response, DEP used federal funding from the EPA to hire two coordinators, and due to gaps in federal funding in 2019 and 2020, used state funding for 18 coordinators working at the county level. DEP&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Office meets weekly with the counties, developed the Clean Water Academy training resources, and has established the CAP Implementation Grant program to help fund local practices.</p>

<p>As more local CAPs have been developed, DEP has increased funding to county efforts over the past 3 years between the CAP Coordinator Grants and the Implementation Grants, from $1.5 million to $7 million to over $15 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Legislative Action is Urgently Needed&nbsp;</u></p>

<p>Despite all the forward momentum and local engagement and planning efforts, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s sizable funding gap remains left unaddressed. The amended Phase 3 WIP still identifies an annual funding gap at $325 million. In fact, little action has occurred over the past 2 years to address the gap.</p>

<p>Until our elected officials in Harrisburg put in place legislation that protects and funds the health of our waterways, we will continue to miss our clean water goals and the quality of our streams will continue to suffer. That&rsquo;s why last year PennFuture released a policy agenda designed to give Pennsylvania lawmakers a roadmap to fund clean water programs and to get us back on track toward meeting our obligations to clean up the Bay.</p>

<p>Titled <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Final-Chesapeake-report.pdf"">&ldquo;Underfunded and Polluted: Solutions to Fund Clean Water in Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake Bay Watershed,&rdquo;</a> our report puts forth a legislative agenda that, if acted upon, would provide the technical assistance, agency support, and public investments needed to put Pennsylvania on the path toward meeting the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load, or the so-called &ldquo;pollution diet&rdquo; goals, by its 2025 end date.</p>

<p>The legislature is sitting on two critical pieces of legislation that would help to narrow the funding gap. Senate Bill 832 would create a Clean Streams Fund, dedicating $250 million from the American Rescue Plan toward various clean-water initiatives. Senate Bill 525 would reinvigorate Growing Greener, a successful conservation program tasked with watershed protection and restoration. After years of reduced funding, the bill would infuse $500 million of ARP funds into a third iteration of the Growing Greener program.</p>

<p>Additionally, the House is considering Senate Bill 251 which seeks to implement new standards and regulations on lawn fertilizer application across Pennsylvania. If passed, SB 251 would significantly improve our water quality impacted by nutrient pollution in Pennsylvania. Over 2,600 miles of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s streams are impaired due to excess nutrients, which is the 5th leading cause. One source of excess nutrients comes from applying excess fertilizer.</p>

<p>We applaud the DEP and counties for their efforts to clean up our local rivers and streams. Pennsylvania still has a long way to go to meet our 2025 goals. The fate of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways, and the Chesapeake Bay, rests largely in the hands of the General Assembly.&nbsp;</p>

Looking Ahead to the Best and Worst of 2022’s Legislative Proposals,12/30/2021,"<p>At a time of unprecedented environmental, economic and public health concerns, now is a time when Pennsylvania&rsquo;s legislators should be developing common-sense solutions.</p>

<p>The General Assembly is unfortunately not known for being the most solutions-oriented of the country&rsquo;s legislative bodies. That said, the most recent legislative session does give us some reason for optimism in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is our roundup of the best - and the worst - of the bills expected to make their way through the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>The Good</u></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Clean Water Funding</li>
</ul>

<p>With thousands of miles of impaired waterways flowing across the state, it is imperative that Pennsylvania dedicates more funding toward conservation, pollution remediation, and agricultural best practices. The American Rescue Plan offers a rare chance to do just that, providing potentially millions of dollars in untapped funding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But first the General Assembly needs to enable state agencies to use ARP funds toward clean-water projects. SB 525 would create a Growing Greener III program and infuse $500 million from ARP funds. Separately, HB 1901 proposes a new Clean Streams Fund that would dedicate resources to improve water quality by reducing agricultural runoff, acid mine drainage, and stormwater pollution across the state. HB 1901 would allocate an additional $250 million in ARP funds.</p>

<p>With the Farm Bureau showing their support, we may finally have a funding mechanism to address our water pollution challenges.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Clean Energy Progress</li>
</ul>

<p>For years, PennFuture has championed legislation that would allow building occupants - including those who are not property owners or who lack roof access - to benefit from solar energy. Community solar legislation (SB472 and HB1555) may finally have its day in the sun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, legislation is progressing to enable changes to a voluntary clean energy financing tool, known as Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE). The update may allow for counties to amend their current programs to expand the financing tool&rsquo;s eligibility to include multi-family buildings (HB1760).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Environmental Justice&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>When Pennsylvania participates in its first emissions-allowance auction as part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), millions of dollars of funding will be made available for clean energy and clean air projects.</p>

<p>SB 15 and HB 1565 proposes to spend those proceeds on programs that would support workers and communities affected by the clean energy transition, investing specifically in frontline and environmental justice communities.</p>

<p>Without this legislation, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)&nbsp;is limited by law in how it can spend auction proceeds. That leaves the door open for the General Assembly to siphon or otherwise divert proceeds to causes or programs that would not benefit frontline workers, communities, or our shared environment.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Bad</u></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>RGGI Drama</li>
</ul>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s long journey toward joining RGGI may soon come to pass &mdash; but not without more desperate flailing from the state&rsquo;s elected officials. The Legislative Reference Bureau refused to publish DEP&rsquo;s final CO2 Budget Trading Rule until after the House completed a resolution to disapprove the rule. Resolution SCRRR1 passed by a vote of 130-70 in December. Fortunately that&rsquo;s short of being veto proof. After Governor Tom Wolf issues his veto, the path to joining the emission-trading program will finally be clear.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ban on Natural Gas Bans</li>
</ul>

<p>Across the country, gas utilities are responding with fear to the growing number of restrictions on gas connections. Consistent with efforts to rapidly decarbonize, cities such as New York and San Francisco have placed limits on gas hookups in new construction homes and businesses. But rather than find creative strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Pennsylavanians&rsquo; natural gas use, HB 1947 and SB 275 would simply prevent individual municipalities from developing their own policies. This &ldquo;energy choice&rdquo; legislation is not only bad climate policy, it&rsquo;s totally inconsistent with claims that the General Assembly values the independence of local municipalities to develop their own regulations.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Undermining Spill Reporting Tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Pipeline accidents, fuel tanker spills, and other environmental catastrophes remain regular occurrences. Despite the need to better enforce existing clean water protections, HB 1842 allows polluters to pollute more, without notifying anyone or without consequence. The legislation would egregiously take away our rights to know when a spill or discharge is impacting public health and local businesses. It jettisons spill reporting requirements from the experts at the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC) and DEP, leaving our waters unprotected and with our communities, families, and businesses uninformed of the&nbsp; risks.</p>

<p>PennFuture will continue to monitor the legislative actions coming from the General Assembly &mdash; the good as well as the disastrous. Stay engaged for action alerts so you can help make sure our legislators act in the best interests of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s natural environment and our most-vulnerable communities.</p>

"Goodbye 2021, Hello 2022",12/28/2021,"<p>When I was a kid, my gang of cousins and I did this thing we called Goodbye School, Hello Summer.&nbsp; An uncle supervised the building of a little bonfire, and in it we burned our books, notebooks and worksheets, and then roasted potatoes in the embers. Good memories, even better potatoes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a comforting recollection of times when taking stock of what was, and what might be, was simpler. As kids growing up in the anthracite region, tossing into a fire the unpleasant, to clear the way for the days of summer, then start all over a few months later and hoping for a better result the next time around, wasn&rsquo;t the worst of our ideas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But here we are, all grown, another year wrapping up and a new one only days away.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re trying to reconcile the current year into a new one. What are the take-aways from 2021, what are the threads that will carry us into 2022, and what might we expect from a new year to the extent we can predict anything?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t identify a bigger cause for vigilance and action than the threats to our democracy that have remained a constant through 2020 into 2021. Yes, PennFuture&rsquo;s mission is an environmental one, but our theory of change relies on having a bipartisan, pro-environment legislature. Our current legislature is far from that benchmark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Attacks on our democracy haven&rsquo;t let up in the past year, and certainly not in the realm PennFuture so often focuses our gaze upon - the state legislature. The same players working to erode our democracy are attacking environmental laws, climate proposals and regulatory programs &ndash; constantly. The entrenchment of its tribes, unholy alliances with industry, and vastly different opinions about what is best for Pennsylvanians is a discordant and constant thrum that has run through year one of the current two-year legislative session.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upcoming 2022 elections and how Pennsylvanians intend to conduct our elections will bring the differences and discord into even sharper focus. As the state legislature approaches the soundness of our democracy, so will go our futures, and prospects for addressing the climate crisis.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>So in 2022 we must be prepared for harder threats to our democracy. We need to be prepared for amped-up attempts to stymy voting through discriminatory practices, and more barriers to creating fairer state and federal legislative district maps.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through PennFuture&rsquo;s strategic work in the civic engagement and democracy arena, we are ready to do our part.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/democracyforall"">Democracy for All PennFuture</a> is a program that registers voters, does civics education and increases voter turnout. Democracy for All is aimed at under-represented demographics including communities of color, single women and young voters, groups where there are gaps between eligibility to vote and actual registrations. Working as part of PA Voice, a statewide table that coordinates efforts of organizations doing similar work, we will build upon PennFuture&rsquo;s program in the Lehigh Valley, expand to Allegheny County, and hopefully establish a presence in Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties, two counties that have been chronically underserved with deep legacies of environmental injustices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our strategic partner Conservation Voters of PA will also be engaging voters in the Philadelphia collar counties and the Poconos.&nbsp;Our democracy must hold together as we go to polls to elect a new governor in 2022.&nbsp; Redistricting should grab the attention of voters everywhere. Geographies of representation will shift, and voters have important decisions to make about who will represent them and their communities in Harrisburg and Washington.</p>

<p>There is cause for guarded optimism for new laws to restore and protect water quality in 2022. There is overdue bipartisan support for several of PennFuture&rsquo;s legislative priorities including the creation of a Clean Water Fund, and <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=251"">programs to educate and limit fertilizer application</a>.&nbsp; In a very exciting development, the reauthorization of a <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=525"">Growing Greener-like program&nbsp;is looking good</a>. This will enable investments in many of the sectors and priorities named by PennFuture in our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/greenstimulus"">Green Stimulus and Economic Recovery Platform for PA</a>. If&nbsp; support for these proposals remains on track, there will be cause for celebration, not only for the environment, but for the bi-partisanship that will have made these wins possible.</p>

<p>As we enter 2022, there is justifiable concern for the fate of what has been PennFuture&rsquo;s climate priority since October 2019-Pennsylvania&rsquo;s enrollment in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), and the resulting reductions of climate-killing emissions in our power sector.&nbsp; Anti-environmental legislators have fought vigorously to kill what was directed by <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-takes-executive-action-to-combat-climate-change-carbon-emissions/"">Governor Wolf&rsquo;s executive order</a> to move us into RGGI.&nbsp;There is the possibility for the program to be implemented in early 2022, but the fights will move into the courts, where PennFuture will work to defend this important program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an organization, PennFuture is a vital team of watchdogs, defenders, and organizers who care deeply about our state, its communities and environment. This upcoming 2022 is as important a New Year as ever. We are working hard toward our mission and need all of you by our side doing the same. We have been encouraged by the sustainable measures included in President Biden&rsquo;s priorities, and we&rsquo;re are all aware of how wrought and complicated the politics of advancing these pro-climate measures have been and will continue to be. We must all stay engaged on the state, federal and local levels. So as we wrap the year, I hope you all find some precious time for respite and re-charge for the big year ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture Meets with State Agencies About Asphalt-Plastic Mixture,12/20/2021,"<p>On Thursday, December 9, 2021, PennFuture met with representatives from the Departments of Transportation (PennDOT), Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), Environmental Protection (DEP), and General Services (DGS), Pennsylvania GreenGov Council, and engineering firm RK&amp;K.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The purpose of this meeting was to gather more information <a href=""https://www.govtech.com/fs/pa-to-pave-road-with-asphalt-recycled-plastic-mixture"">regarding a pilot program announced in October</a> to pave a portion of a Ridley Creek State Park roadway in Delaware County&nbsp;with an asphalt and recycled plastic mixture. We stated our support for innovative ways to reduce single-use plastic trash in our environment, and our willingness to learn more about the pilot project, their plans for testing and evaluation over their stated five-year period, any additional pilot projects they may be considering, while also expressing PennFuture&rsquo;s water quality concerns regarding microplastic pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the initial letter requesting a meeting was sent, it was announced in November that Shell would be paving <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/story/news/2021/11/12/shell-partners-recycling-company-pave-roads/8588093002/"">nearly six miles of their Beaver County site</a> with an asphalt and plastic mixture. We inquired further about this project as well.</p>

<p>DCNR, DEP, and the other agencies present stressed their desire to seek innovative ways to reduce plastic pollution in our Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plastic modified asphalt mixture used in the pilot program is being evaluated by PennDOT&rsquo;s laboratory, where ongoing controlled testing is being conducted.&nbsp; Early laboratory testing exhibits no microplastics released from the asphalt mixtures containing the recycled plastic modifier.&nbsp; Field tests will be conducted two times a year for three years (and then annually for the next two years), specifically to study the effect of natural wear-and-tear on the roadway, and will assess whether microplastics are detected in rainwater runoff from the test and conventional asphalt roadway sections.&nbsp; As part of ongoing research led by PennDOT, they anticipate engaging in more pilot projects utilizing similar asphalt modifiers or other recycled materials products to support the Commonwealth&rsquo;s move to more sustainable policies and infrastructure.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
PennDOT also noted that asphalt modifiers are not uncommon, especially when incorporating asphalt millings [commonly known as recycled asphalt pavement (RAP)] in new asphalt mixtures.&nbsp; PennDOT emphasized that DOTs extend the life cycle of asphalt by utilizing modifiers manufactured with polymers from virgin sources.&nbsp; In the case of the plastic modified asphalt mixture used in this pilot program, the agencies note that the plastic component is a 2% additive of the binder that comprises approximately 5% of the overall asphalt mixture &ndash; which results in a very minimal amount of plastic present.&nbsp; Yet, this quantity of plastic adds stiffening but does not compromise the required flexibility of the pavement; too stiff, and the asphalt can crack while too much flexibility results in the formation of ruts.&nbsp; According to the representatives present, laboratory and field trials undertaken in other states indicate that plastic concentrations above 5% may risk increased cracking.&nbsp; The agencies claim that the release of microplastics seems highly unlikely because the modifier, which can be in a paste, wax, or pellet form, is melted and homogenized as an inseparable binder mixture during the formulation of the asphalt at the plant; however, they are committed to undertaking the studies discussed above.</p>

<p>In regards to the Shell asphalt-plastic mixture project, the agencies present stated that there is little oversight in regards to private projects such as this one. Many contractors do follow PennDOT asphalt specification, but PennDOT does not have a say on private roads. DEP, however, can choose to monitor the environmental impact of these private roads. DEP stated that they do not have plans to monitor the Shell road project at this time. In response to PennFuture&rsquo;s concerns about this use of post-consumer plastic modifiers creating more microplastic water pollution, one of the representatives said that <a href=""https://greenmantra.com/the-plastic-road-ahead/"">Green Mantra</a>, the organization behind Shell&rsquo;s mixture, has stated their lab tests showed that nothing was identified as plastic one the asphalt and plastic were mixed.</p>

<p>Microplastic contamination is a prevailing issue worldwide, including in Pennsylvania. PennEnvironment <a href=""https://pennenvironment.org/reports/pac/microplastics-pennsylvania"">sampled over 50 of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s rivers</a>, lakes, and streams and found microplastics in 100% of those samples -- with the subsequent report stating that humans are consuming roughly a credit card&rsquo;s worth of plastic every week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate the agencies&rsquo; willingness to meet with us and offer more clarity in regards to the pilot program. While the agencies expressed their comfort with the use of post-consumer plastic in asphalt mixtures not increasing microplastic pollution in our waters, PennFuture still has concerns regarding the long-term environmental impacts of the asphalt-plastic mixture. We will continue to monitor projects like this that could add to the alarming presence of microplastics in Pennsylvania&#39;s waters.</p>

Renewable Natural Gas: Hope or Hype?,12/16/2021,"<p>&ldquo;Renewable natural gas&rdquo; (RNG) sounds good, but does it live up to the hype as a green alternative to fracked gas or is it something like the mythical &ldquo;clean coal&rdquo;&mdash; <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ad-firm-behind-clean-coal_b_210086"">an invention of a high-powered advertising agency hired</a> by a coal-industry front group? Like many things, the reality is a little more complicated than labels like &ldquo;clean&rdquo; or &ldquo;green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fracked gas is a fossil fuel. It&rsquo;s made up primarily of methane (CH4) that was formed hundreds of millions of years ago from the decay of plant and animal waste and has been trapped deep underground ever since. Rather than leaving it undisturbed, we drill and frack to bring it to the surface where it either leakes into the atmosphere or is burned releasing carbon dioxide (CO2).&nbsp; In either case, it&rsquo;s pollution directly contributes to the climate crisis.</p>

<p>There is another fuel called &ldquo;biogas&rdquo; which isn&rsquo;t a fossil fuel&mdash;it is formed from decaying waste in landfills, sewage plants, or livestock farms. Instead of releasing long buried pollutants, biogas is part of a carbon cycle where plants and animals take up carbon and then release it as waste a relatively short time later. This at least raises the possibility of having fuel use result in no net increase in carbon pollution.</p>

<p>While replacing fracked gas with biogas seems like an obvious solution, it doesn&rsquo;t always work. Biogas has a much lower methane content and can contain much more CO2 along with many other chemicals. It isn&rsquo;t the drop-in replacement we would like. That is where RNG comes in&mdash;it is biogas that has been refined to be a better substitute for fracked gas.</p>

<p>So, is substituting RNG for fracked gas the solution we are looking for? There is a temptation to compare RNG to fracked gas in isolation and conclude burning a biofuel is better than burning a fossil fuel. Unfortunately, that is answering the wrong question.</p>

<p>A lower-emitting version of fracked gas may be a useful tool in our toolbox, but that isn&rsquo;t the ultimate goal. Our actual focus needs to be on the transition to a sustainable energy economy that gets us to net-zero carbon as rapidly as possible. This requires looking at the big picture and asking how RNG fits in our broader energy and environmental systems. It also requires looking at the specific sources of RNG and deciding if using it makes sense.</p>

<p>For example, one possible source for RNG is from manure produced at a concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). These are industrial operations that raise far more livestock than a farm could naturally manage and, in the process, release huge amounts of pollution to our air and water.&nbsp;Having RNG as a marketable product makes CAFOs more profitable&mdash;effectively subsidizing more pollution.</p>

<p>Some may argue that capturing the methane from CAFOs and creating RNG is a better solution than releasing it into the atmosphere, but that is a false choice.&nbsp;Before we get to that point, we should recognize that CAFOs themselves are the result of policy choices that incentivise industrial agriculture operations at the expense of more sustainable farms.&nbsp;In a well designed system using more traditional farming practices, waste products can be fertilizer rather than being diverted for fuel.</p>

<p>There are similar issues on the demand side as well.&nbsp;Taking a narrow view one could argue that RNG is a better option for heating, cooking, and other fossil fuel uses.&nbsp;Looking at the big picture we can ask if the fuel use is necessary in the first place.&nbsp;Investments in energy efficiency can be a highly cost-effective way to reduce demand and electrification makes it possible to replace fuel use with clean and renewable energy like wind and solar.</p>

<p>RNG may have a role in a clean energy future, but at best it will be a supporting actor. We don&rsquo;t have the capacity to make anywhere near enough RNG to displace the current demand for fracked gas, and what we can produce is significantly more expensive.&nbsp;That means that we have to think carefully about where it makes sense to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, RNG production is, at its core, a refinery operation.&nbsp;Even if it can be done in a way that is carbon neutral, there are still potential impacts on the environment and especially on neighboring communities. It might have a role in decarbonizing industrial applications that need methane as a feedstock, rely on combustion as part of the process, or for some other reason can&rsquo;t effectively be electrified, but it&rsquo;s not a panacea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For all its potential uses, there are some serious risks.&nbsp;The pipe-dream of RNG &ldquo;solving the climate crisis&rdquo; could easily become a convenient excuse or justification to build and maintain fossil fuel infrastructure.&nbsp;Doing so will lock in reliance on the fracked gas industry and other unsustainable business practices for years to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Going forward we need to look at the big picture and prioritize our investments in the technologies and systems that we truly need.</p>

<p>In a January 2021 Executive Order, President Joe Biden recognized the urgency of putting Americans back to work as well as the huge number of workers we&rsquo;ll need to build the green economy. <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/"">Executive Order 14008</a> calls for a new Civilian Climate Corps Initiative that would &ldquo;mobilize the next generation of conservation and resilience workers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since then, President Biden&rsquo;s vision has materialized in the <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376"">Build Back Better Act.</a> The reconciliation package passed by the U.S. House of Representatives provides $10 billion for the federal government to engage 300,000 Americans with good-paying jobs and workforce-development opportunities over the next decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If adopted by the Senate, the proposed program would - like the original CCC - help lift thousands of Pennsylvanians out of poverty, while building natural climate solutions, climate resiliency projects, and clean energy improvements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of our most-underserved communities are also the most vulnerable to climate disasters and the public health impacts of climate change. In recognition of these overlapping crises, a <a href=""https://neguse.house.gov/imo/media/doc/CCC%20Letter%20-%20Final%20Signed%20(004).pdf"">framework CCC policy</a> endorsed by Congressional leaders proposed half of funds would be directed toward hiring from disadvantaged and frontline communities, with special attention on formerly incarcerated individuals, unemployed youth, and veterans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Congress continues to negotiate the Building Back Better Agenda, private donors are already working to launch complimentary programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The William Penn Foundation (WPF) <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/william-penn-foundation-20211203.html"">recently announced a $1.65 million Delaware River Climate Corps</a> that would fund up to 200 jobs restoring landscapes, installing green stormwater infrastructure, and performing home weatherization throughout the Delaware River watershed. Funds will expand upon existing, or establish new, climate and conservation workforce programs within ten watershed communities across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and New York, positioning them for additional federal funding.</p>

<p>WPF should be applauded for its visionary and generous leadership. Their philanthropy will cover the costs for training, mentorships, salaries, and administration of programs across 10 communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Delaware River Climate Corps stands as a model for how a CCC can uplift environmental justice communities. In particular, WPF plans to prioritize opportunities for young adults aging out of foster care and formerly incarcerated adults reentering society.</p>

<p>After all, the&nbsp; economic hardship endured by formerly incarcerated people - especially people of color - is comparable with struggles Americans faced during the Great Depression. Prior to the pandemic, the unemployment rate for formerly incarcerated people was estimated to be five times higher than for the general public. At 27 percent, <a href=""https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/outofwork.html"">that&rsquo;s substantially higher</a> than when unemployment peaked in 1933.</p>

<p>At a time of multiple crises, the CCC can begin the process of correcting generational injustices. We are long overdue to step up action to address the climate crisis, to restore and to reclaim the natural beauty of our natural resources, and to establish meaningful career pathways for members of our society who have the fewest opportunities for advancement.&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture Appeals MS4 Permits Issued by Department of Environmental Protection,12/7/2021,"<p>In late October, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued two individual Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Individual Permits for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC).&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture, alongside allied environmental organizations, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Comment-Letter---PennDOT-and-PTC-MS4-IPs_FINAL.pdf"">provided the DEP with feedback</a> during the comment period when these permits were in their draft phase this year.&nbsp;While the DEP has addressed some of our concerns, two critical flaws were enshrined into the final permit. First, the permit gives unequal treatment to PennDOT versus other municipalities, creating a significantly larger volume of overall stormwater runoff. Second, in a defiance of simple logic and science, the DEP has allowed PennDOT to combine together three different watersheds into one for planning purposes. On Monday, November 30, PennFuture filed an appeal of this permit to protect the waterways of the Commonwealth and to ensure that municipalities are all given equal treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, a little background. In Pennsylvania, stormwater is a leading cause of impairment of our Commonwealth&rsquo;s waterways, and that stormwater from roads is directly linked to degraded physical, chemical, and biological conditions. These permits, and in particular the PennDOT permit, regulate a huge amount of surface area, and thus a correspondingly huge amount of stormwater pollution. Different watersheds, of course, have different needs in order to protect their individual streams, rivers, and groundwater.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the first time, the current cycle (2018-2023) of the MS4 General Permit&mdash;which applies to a number of local municipal governments across the state&mdash;included a Pollution Reduction requirement. This element was geared towards the restoration of polluted waters, and was designed to allow Pennsylvania to begin to fulfill its Clean Water Act goals of upholding and restoring the designated uses of the waters of the Commonwealth. These local governments have been working diligently to comply with these sometimes-challenging requirements. As a result, many have already made significant progress towards their 2023 goals, and PennFuture applauds that work.</p>

<p>However, the Pollution Reduction element of the MS4 program cannot be successful without robust participation and leadership by PennDOT and PTC as well. In PennFuture&rsquo;s comments earlier this year, we wrote of our concern that the draft permit, which provided for a lower overall Pollution Reduction number for PennDOT than is required for other municipalities, would severely undercut the overall effectiveness of the Pollution Reduction goal. In the end, the final permit does exactly that: the permit requires PennDOT to reduce existing pollutant loads in the Delaware, Ohio, and Lake Erie watersheds by as little as 3.0% for sediment, while municipalities in those watersheds are required under their applicable MS4 permit to reduce existing pollutant loads for sediment by 10%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, we arrive at the current appeal. It is in the nature of PennDOT&rsquo;s business to manage roads and other impermeable surfaces. It&rsquo;s easy to see that by the simple fact that PennDOT mainly manages roads that it will have a higher overall volume of stormwater runoff than a local town or city government, who manage many different kinds of surfaces. The DEP&rsquo;s supporting logic is that even at the lower percentages, PennDOT will reduce their pollutants by a similar amount as regulated municipalities. This logic is the kind that almost makes sense, as long as you don&rsquo;t think about it too hard. DEP&rsquo;s permit tries to hide how low the bar is by focusing comparing apples to oranges: it focuses on the overall volume of stormwater reduction by PennDOT as compared to municipalities, instead of comparing the percentage of reduction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pause and think about the implications of that. If, at only 5% reduction, PennDOT is doing a comparable pollutant reduction to municipalities at 10%, then it is clear that the baseline load of PennDOT must be at least twice that of those municipalities. At that kind of stormwater runoff, the DEP should be striving to minimize it as much as possible, not to give PennDOT a free pass. It is easy to see that this is both unfair to those other municipalities who have been working diligently and a tremendous wasted opportunity for real stormwater runoff reductions and improvement of waterways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to this flaw in overall volume reductions, the permit allows PennDOT to combine three major watersheds into one for the purposes of developing a pollution reduction plan. The EPA allows watershed-based permits because it recognizes that viewing each watershed holistically&mdash;from the big rivers to the small streams to the groundwater&mdash;makes more sense from a scientific standpoint and leads to better outcomes. It doesn&rsquo;t take an advanced degree to see that combining different watersheds goes directly against this principle, because it is no longer viewing each watershed holistically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of these two significant problems, PennFuture has appealed this permit. We won&rsquo;t let the this potentially major runoff issue flow downstream any further.&nbsp;</p>

Living in the Blast Zone: Fracking's Bomb Trains,12/6/2021,"<p>In March of this year, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/fracking-ban-delaware-river-permanent-drbc-20210225.html"">banned the process of hydraulic fracturing</a>, or fracking, within the watershed. While this vote is a victory, it did not end all threats posed by the industry to the basin. To that end, the DRBC <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-DRBC-Proposed-Regulations-Ban-Discharge-of-Fracking-Wastewater-Discourages-Fracking-Related-Interbasin-Water-Transfers"">has not yet finalized rules</a> on the transport of fracking wastewater through the region, as well as the withdrawal of water from the basin for the purpose of fracking in the Marcellus Shale region.</p>

<p>While the issue of fracking in the basin is still unsettled, the fracking industry is still thinking of new ways to threaten the health of our waterways and communities. Allow me to introduce you to <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-4-Liquified-Natural-Gas-Should-Not-Become-the-New-Bomb-Trains-to-Threaten-Our-Communities"">bomb trains.</a></p>

<p>Currently, there are plans to build a natural gas liquefaction facility in Wyalusing, Bradford County that would process fracked gas from the Marcellus Shale and liquefy it for transport via truck or train. This product is called Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), and the intent is for New Fortress Energy to deliver it to a port along the Delaware River <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">more than 200 miles south in Gibbstown, New Jersey</a> for international export.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because LNG is so volatile and explosive, transporting it via train <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/03/lng-trains-trump/"">was not permitted in the United States until recently</a>, when the Trump administration changed the rules. LNG must be kept at -260 Fahrenheit in order to stay in liquid form. When the temperature is raised, the methane returns to gas form, expanding up to 600 times its previous volume in liquid form, and the consequences could be catastrophic. According to an article <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/03/lng-trains-trump/"">published in the Washington Post</a>, &quot;If safety valves fail, what engineers call a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion, or BLEVE, would follow, probably blowing the damaged tank car apart and putting anyone nearby at risk.&quot; What&#39;s more is that LNG is highly flammable, burning at extreme temperatures so hot that a fire fueled by LNG cannot be extinguished; it must simply be allowed to burn out. Some experts liken a large-scale explosion of this material to the <a href=""https://www.njspotlight.com/2021/03/opponents-gibbstown-gloucester-county-lng-terminal-export-want-gov-phil-murphy-follow-delaware-river-basin-fracking-ban-stop-project/"">impact of a nuclear bomb.</a></p>

<p>While the exact routes for the potential train and truck transport have not been made public, <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/ongoing-issues/lng-gibbstown-interactive-map"">it is not difficult to ascertain what the preferred routes may b</a>e. Both routes will likely travel through densely populated areas, like Allentown, Reading, and Philadelphia. These are routes that already see large amounts of both rail and truck traffic, whose emissions especially impact communities of color and low-income communities. <a href=""https://grist.org/politics/the-delaware-river-basin-paradox-why-fracking-is-so-hard-to-quit/"">According to an article published by Grist</a>, &quot;More than a million and a half people live within a 2-mile radius of the possible LNG transportation routes. Twenty-nine percent of those individuals, a little less than half a million people, are people of color, and 24 percent, some 400,000 people, are low income. <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/Letter%20from%20Philadelphia%20City%20Officials%20to%20DRBC%20(2020-12-04).pdf"">In a letter to the DRBC last December</a>, Philadelphia city officials wrote that New Fortress Energy&rsquo;s LNG transport route through Philadelphia &ldquo;will expose black and brown and low-income communities to the most intense and inescapable zone of impact should there be an accident such as a derailment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To compound the dangers posed to communities of color, this additional traffic - whether by rail or by truck - will exacerbate poor air quality and significantly contribute to the cumulative impacts of pollution that they already face. While rail shipments of LNG could include more than 100 cars per day, there may be as many as 300-400 trucks per day on local routes delivering LNG to the Gibbstown port.</p>

<p>While the proposed rail routes would not run along the Delaware River, they would, however, run along a lengthy stretch of the Lehigh River, which is a vital tributary to the mighty Delaware and is also the lifeblood of the economies of rural communities in the Poconos. Additionally, the trains would travel through Lehigh Gorge State Park, a beloved site of recreation for folks from the tri-state area. This region is at the heart of the outdoor recreation and tourist industries that are revitalizing communities in the Poconos that were ravaged by the coal extraction industry.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the transport of LNG along these truck and train routes not only puts historically disadvantaged communities in the blast radius if a catastrophe should occur, but even under the best circumstances, the traffic emissions produced would further degrade the poor air quality that urban centers like Allentown and Philadelphia already experience - <a href=""https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/compare-your-air?msa1=Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton,%20PA-NJ&amp;msa2=Philadelphia-Reading-Camden,%20PA-NJ-DE-MD"">Philadelphia has the worst air quality in the state</a>, while the Lehigh Valley has the distinction of having the fourth worst air quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, we have not yet seen bomb trains running through our area, and they may still be prevented from coming to pass.&nbsp;The Biden administration <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/08/2021-23132/hazardous-materials-suspension-of-hmr-amendments-authorizing-transportation-of-liquefied-natural-gas"">has announced its intent to suspend and revisit</a> the Trump-era rule allowing rail transport of LNG.&nbsp;Additionally, the special permit issued to New Fortress Energy allowing it to transport LNG by rail even in the absence of the general Trump-era rule expired on November 30, 2021 (though&nbsp; it is our understanding that, at the last minute, the company applied for an extension). It is unclear whether this means the end of the risk of bomb trains, and we must remain vigilant against this risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no question that transporting LNG from the liquefaction plant in Wyalusing to Gibbstown poses clear and present dangers for communities along the proposed routes. This entire scheme of &ldquo;dry&rdquo; LNG, liquifying the fracked gas hundreds of miles from the export port where it will be shipped to foriegn consumers, is untested, unnecessary, and dangerous. By developing new methods of transport, the fossil fuel extraction industry continues to expand its impacts deep into communities that otherwise are disconnected from the harvesting and processing of material.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These bomb trains demonstrate the ever-expansive nature of Pennsylvania&#39;s environmental sacrifice zones and highlight which communities enjoy the least protection.</p>

Breaking Down the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,11/23/2021,"<p>The federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) will truly transform Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Historic for its size, breadth and ambition, IIJA will mark a historic turning point in the nation&rsquo;s (long overdue) efforts to address climate change, water pollution, and environmental justice, while also rebuilding traditional infrastructure long overlooked, underfunded and under maintained.</p>

<p>Across the Commonwealth, our infrastructure systems face serious challenges. Pennsylvania has some of the oldest transit systems, underground utilities, and polluted sites in the country. Due to decades without adequate cleanup funds, polluting sites have been left to fester, while Black and brown communities often deal with the resulting health consequences. Our buildings, cars and buses are largely powered by fossil fuels, while at the same time, climate change threatens our communities, natural habitats, and critical infrastructure with greater and more-intense wildfires, heat waves, storms, and flooding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With $550 billion in new funding over the next five years, IIJA is a much-needed game changer. If the Build Back Better agenda passes through reconciliation, we could see the federal government spend roughly $500 billion in additional infrastructure funding. Altogether, that&rsquo;s more funding on infrastructure than the nation spent during the New Deal era.</p>

<p>But will the spending result in more of the same? Or will we see true environmental progress throughout Pennsvylania&rsquo;s communities, better rides while on our commutes, and more-reliable infrastructure during future storms?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how each section of the massive infrastructure package grades out for the Commonwealth and for the environment as a whole.</p>

<p><u>Restoration</u></p>

<p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: For decades, the federal government has provided inadequate funding for states to clean up legacy pollution whether from mining, oil and gas rigs, or chemical production and disposal. That&rsquo;s about to change. Here are comparisons of how IIJA will increase previous funding levels:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Abandoned Mine Reclamation: After the country spent $6 billion on cleanup over the past four decades, IIJA will make $11.3 billion available over the next 15 years, with at least a quarter expected to be spent in Pennsylvania.</li>
	<li>Plugging Orphan Wells: The Department of Environmental Protection last year <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/business-fd5ce46869d8405113f159bee0b7c44d"">had less than $800,000 available</a> to plug abandoned oil and gas wells. Moving forward, Pennsylvania is expected to receive a large share of the $4.7 billion allocated nationwide.</li>
	<li>Superfund Sites: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has historically provided states <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-remedial-annual-accomplishments#2020funding"">with about $4.7 billion</a> to remediate toxic Superfund and brownfield sites. Looking ahead, an expansion of how the IRS taxes chemical producers will provide an additional $8 billion for restoration projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What We Don&rsquo;t LIke</strong>: IIJA will provide an unprecedented boost in funding to remediate polluted sites across the country. Still, the costs to fully clean up our degraded land and water far exceed the new funding levels. The costs for abandoned mine lands alone are <a href=""https://appvoices.org/resources/AML_Funding_Projections_11.3billion_simple.pdf"">estimated to surpass $26 billion.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><u>Water</u></p>

<p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: About $1.4 billion will fund repairs to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s deteriorating water infrastructure, improving the safety of drinking water and the quality of the state&rsquo;s waterways. Those funds will help replace the 160,000 lead service lines estimated to still be in operation across the Commonwealth. Regional water protection programs will also receive funding boosts, including programs for the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p><strong>What We Don&rsquo;t LIke</strong>: The final legislation provides $15 billion to help remove legacy lead drinking water pipes, far less money than the $45 billion President Joe Biden originally proposed. Any effort to remove lead is progress, but far greater funds will be needed to eliminate the risks of lead poisoning. Build Back Better may add another $9 billion, so stay tuned.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<u>Transportation</u></p>

<p><strong>What we like:</strong> IIJA will encourage more travelers to choose rail or public transit over more polluting modes of travel. Funding will go toward projects that improve rail service along the Northeast Corridor, as well as the Pennsylvanian and Keystone routes, while potentially expanding service into Northeast Pennsylvania. The $2.8 billion allocated to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s bus and rail fleets will be a major boon for public transit across the state, with SEPTA and the Port Authority of Allegheny County receiving much-needed funding. Billions of dollars in new funding will go toward new bicycling and walking trails. Safety for cyclists and pedestrians may improve with new requirements that states develop plans that consider all commuters. A new Reconnecting Communities program will attempt to address historical social justice inequities by uniting communities divided by roadways.</p>

<p><strong>What We Don&rsquo;t Like</strong>: Much of the federal aid will encourage the status quo. Highway programs will widen roads and add lanes; airport improvements will expand terminal capacity. These projects will inevitably lead to more cars on the road, planes in the air, and emissions to continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Electrification</u></p>

<p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: The most-significant climate change mitigation efforts will come from funding that electrifies transportation and helps the power grid accommodate new sources of demand. The first national investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure will build a network of chargers along U.S. highways and within disadvantaged communities. At least $171 million of new funding will add EV chargers along the Pennsylvania Turnpike and across the state. Transit agencies, school districts, and port authorities will also benefit with funding to purchase and charge zero-emission vehicles. New transmission lines will facilitate expansion of renewable energy into the power grid.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What We Don&rsquo;t Like</strong>: Grants for charging infrastructure will also be made available for development of propane and compressed natural gas (CNG) refueling stations. Transit agencies will be able to use the funds on &ldquo;low-emission buses&rdquo; such as hybrid or CNG vehicles, not only ZEVs. Funds for &ldquo;clean hydrogen&rdquo; fuel cell electric vehicles will potentially subsidize the expansion of natural gas to build new hydrogen supplies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Clean Energy</u></p>

<p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will now have authority to approve new transmission capacity in some areas where renewable energy otherwise cannot connect to the grid. Some $6 billion in battery storage will further help to maximize electricity generated from wind and solar power. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s older buildings can better save energy with projects that tap the $3 billion invested nationwide in energy efficiency and weatherization programs.</p>

<p><strong>What We Don&rsquo;t Like</strong>: Clean energy demonstration projects are great. But we have to question the financial and environmental benefit of continuing to invest in technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration, which many analysts consider simply a lifeline for coal power in a decarbonized world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Resiliency</u></p>

<p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: IIJA represents the largest investment in the resilience of physical and natural systems in American history. A total of $50 billion will be spent to protect infrastructure from extreme weather events caused by climate change as well as the increasing threat of cyberattacks. The legislation finally acknowledges that, in addition to mitigating the consequences of climate change, we must prepare for disasters. Otherwise we will keep paying to repair the damage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What We Don&rsquo;t Like</strong>: Protecting U.S. coastlines from sea level rise would, on its own, cost more than $400 billion. Addressing the floods, landslides and heatwaves that will accompany the climate crisis will come at a much greater cost. In Pennsylvania, we&rsquo;re already paying <a href=""https://www.phillymag.com/news/2019/11/15/climate-change-costs-pa/"">hundreds of millions of dollars per year.</a></p>

<p><u>Wildlife</u></p>

<p><strong>What We LIke</strong>: IIJA clearly includes natural resources in the definition of infrastructure. The package includes&nbsp;$2 billion for Army Corps of Engineers aquatic ecosystem restoration projects, $1 billion for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, $1 billion to repair or remove stormwater culverts that block passage for threatened or endangered fish, $500 million for prescribed burning to limit wildfires, and $350 million for the construction of overpasses that allow wildlife to cross roadways.</p>

<p><strong>What We Don&rsquo;t Like</strong>: The legislation contains multiple provisions that could potentially limit environmental reviews of infrastructure development under the National Environmental Policy Act. Federal review of certain forest-management and ecosystem-restoration protections may be truncated as a result, suggesting the need for on-going oversight will be essential as so many large infrastructure projects get underway.</p>

<p>Overall, the infrastructure package will help better connect our communities, repair our broken systems, rejuvenate our polluted landscapes, and better prepare ourselves for the economic and environmental challenges to come. The Build Back Better agenda, if passed by Congress, will take us from fixing what&rsquo;s broken to building the infrastructure that makes us collectively stronger and healthier for generations to come. Look out for more analysis after Congress completes the legislation.</p>

Philadelphia Energy Solutions Hearing Brings Environmental Justice to Forefront,11/19/2021,"<p>The case for environmental justice stood centerstage this week during a hearing on the ongoing remediation efforts at the former Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) refinery complex. The Pennsylvania Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee <a href=""https://environmental.pasenategop.com/committee-hearing-explores-remediation-of-philadelphia-oil-refinery/"">held its second hearing</a> related to the former refinery and the aftermath of the 2019 <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/energy/bankrupt-pes-philadelphia-refinery-sues-supplier-babcock-for-explosion-20210303.html"">explosion and fire</a> that ultimately led it to cease operations. PennFuture proudly stood with community members, public health experts, and environmental advocates to call for a more vigorous cleanup at the site to guarantee a safer and healthier environment for nearby communities.</p>

<p>The former refinery site includes an estimated 1,400 acres and encompasses more space than Center City in Philadelphia. For a time, it served as the largest refinery on the East Coast. But more importantly, it served as a constant source of anguish and anger for the surrounding communities as they suffered the ill effects of living in such proximity to <a href=""https://e360.yale.edu/features/in-a-refinerys-ashes-hope-for-an-end-to-decades-of-pollution"">Philadelphia&rsquo;s largest source of pollution</a> and environmental degradation.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that the refinery <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pes-bankruptcy/philadelphia-energy-solutions-files-for-bankruptcy-after-refinery-fire-idUSKCN1UH0O9"">had struggled financially</a> for many years. PES entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, only to reenter Chapter 11 following the 2019 explosion. Less than a decade earlier, the site&rsquo;s previous owner, Sunoco, deemed the refinery so costly that it was prepared to close its operations if a buyer could not be found. PES purchased the site only with the promise of substantial subsidies and tax relief provided <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/media/20191202091559/refineryreport12219.pdf"">by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</a></p>

<p>In many ways, the fire that caused the refinery site to close served as <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/energy/south-philadelphia-oil-refinery-explosion-sale-pes-hilco-pollution-environment-20200214.html"">a moment of hope</a> for residents in South and Southwest Philadelphia. Persistent odors emanating from the site began to disappear. Residents began to envision a future use for the site <a href=""https://philly.curbed.com/2019/6/26/18759820/pes-refinery-shutdown-fire-land-remediation"">free of fossil fuels</a> and they hoped for increased collaboration from the new owners, which became Hilco Redevelopment Partners (HRP).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although HRP has engaged in a sophisticated and concerted <a href=""https://www.thebellwetherdistrict.com/"">promotional campaign</a> to <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/the-bellwether-district-hilcos-new-brand-for-the-old-pes-refinery-complex-in-south-philly/"">rebrand the site</a>, the new owners have often failed to substantively engage with surrounding communities on the future use of the site, relying on vague plans to create a life sciences hub and distribution center that will supposedly create thousands of jobs. During testimony, PennFuture shared the concerns residents have raised surrounding the narrow interpretation of public participation requirements established by Act 2. Impacted residents have consistently voiced concerns that information related to the remediation is not presented in a timely manner and is not presented in a clear and concise manner. While we recognize that this work began under the cloud of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions on public gatherings, we join community residents in calling for additional efforts from Evergreen Resources Group, LLC (Evergreen), and HRP to substantively engage with the public on the ongoing remediation of the site.</p>

<p>PennFuture supports the efforts of organizations like the <a href=""https://www.unitedsouthsw.org/"">United South-Southwest Coalition</a> and their ongoing grassroots efforts to engage with residents, harness their collective power, and demand accountability from Evergreen, HRP, the City of Philadelphia, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The refinery may be closed but much work remains to be done to ensure that the site is remediated thoroughly and effectively to ensure the health and safety of nearby communities. PennFuture hopes that the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee will seek to strengthen requirements surrounding public participation under Act 2.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we hope that this site serves as a stark reminder of the critical need to rethink planning and development in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. No longer can we ignore that low-income communities and communities of color <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/magazine/pollution-philadelphia-black-americans.html"">have suffered a disproportionate impact</a> from historically racist practices like redlining and short-sighted environmental policies that directly harmed their friends and families.</p>

<p>Environmental justice must be at the heart of our policies related to land use, zoning, and development. Environmental justice must be at the heart of our environmental policies. Last month, PennFuture proudly stood with Governor Wolf, the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus, advocates, stakeholders, and community members, to support executive and legislative initiatives that would codify and expand the Office of Environmental Justice within the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p>One of those initiatives, <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=189"">Senate Bill 189,</a> was introduced by State Senator Vincent Hughes and referred to the Committee in February. PennFuture strongly supports this legislation and its proposed aims of addressing environmental justice in low-income communities and communities of color, integrating environmental justice throughout the regulatory process, and developing a statewide environmental justice strategy for the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remediation efforts at the former refinery complex have further identified the need to review Act 2 and the requirements contained within it. But, this process has also underscored the need to prioritize the health and well-being of people and communities when decisions are being made with regard to land use, zoning, and development. Senate Bill 189 will put Pennsylvania on a path to do this and we hope that the Committee will take up the legislation.</p>

Nigerian Princes: How the Fracked Gas Industry Killed Pennsylvania Coal and Raised Electricity Prices While Swimming in Taxpayer Subsidies,11/10/2021,"<p>At one point or another we all likely received one of those emails. A Nigerian prince, or some attorney, bank officer, or minor government official in a far-off country has millions of dollars, gold, or&nbsp;diamonds stuck in a bank&nbsp;and they need your help to get it out. In return&nbsp;they promise, for just a little help, a large chunk of the money will be ours to keep.</p>

<p>If one responds, the scammer may first ask for something that a legitimate transaction would require, like signatures on official looking papers or copies of identification documents, but that won&rsquo;t be enough. An issue will come up and they will need money to pay for wire transfers, court fees, or even bribes. The amounts may be small compared to the millions they promise, at least at first, but more issues will arise requiring even more money. Eventually the victims either get wise to the scam or run out of money and the fraudsters disappear without a trace. These are known as <a href=""https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/advance-fee-schemes"">advance fee scams</a> and have been perpetrated, in one form or another, for many years.</p>

<p>One of the reasons these scams work is that, in addition to preying on greed, scammers also rely on some quirks of human psychology&mdash;in particular the sunk cost fallacy. This same effect causes people who lose $1,000 at a casino to bet another $1,000 in a desperate attempt to win their money back. Economists say &ldquo;rational&rdquo; people should cut their losses and move on, but casino owners count on that being much harder than it sounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Governments are susceptible to this too. Perhaps the most famous case was the British and French governments continuing to spend money developing the supersonic aircraft Concorde long after they knew <a href=""http://filestore.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pdfs/large/cab-129-160.pdf"">&ldquo;there was no economic case for proceeding with the aircraft.&rdquo;</a> Part of their rationale for going forward anyway was not wanting to lose the &ldquo;26,000 jobs&rdquo; that would be needed to build the 160 to 250 aircraft they were planning to sell. While the most pessimistic view at the time said they might only sell around 60 aircraft, they didn&rsquo;t even get close to that number. In reality only 14 Concordes were built for commercial service and the 26,000 jobs never materialized.</p>

<p><u>Sunk Costs in the Fracked Gas and Petrochemical Industry&nbsp;</u></p>

<p>When the shale gas industry came to Pennsylvania, industry lobbyists told&nbsp;our legislators how profitable it would be. Not only did they promise 200,000 jobs, they repeatedly referred to a severance tax they fully expected to pay and all the economic benefits the industry would bring to our communities. The only thing they needed was a little help: faster permitting, weak regulations, <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/06/25/pa-grand-jury-report-on-fracking-dep-failed-to-protect-peoples-health/"">poor oversight</a>, low-cost bonding, advantageous zoning rules, the doctor gag rule, eminent domain benefits, and the list goes on. <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1068716167567227972&amp;q=robinson+township+v+commonwealth&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,39"">The courts disallowed</a> some of the early gifts to the industry, but many remain and Pennsylvania still doesn&rsquo;t levy a severance tax (instead it charges a more industry beneficial, declining impact fee).</p>

<p>Investors were taken with the promise of riches and, as the money flowed in, the drilling increased, peaking at almost 2,000 wells drilled in 2011 alone. Even as the drilling continued to grow, it was clear supply was outpacing demand. The gas was selling for $9.00 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in 2008 but was under $6.00/Mcf by 2011 and slid down below $3.50/Mcf in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the glut hit and gas prices dropped, the fracking industry faced a wave of bankruptcies and contractions, some companies got out of the business altogether&mdash;the promised jobs and prosperity didn&rsquo;t materialize. Between 2008 and 2019&mdash;in spite of the industry increasing production and bringing in tens of millions of dollars&mdash;personal income and jobs in the region <a href=""https://www.concernedohioriverresidents.org/post/orvi-report-shows-fracking-boom-was-an-economic-bust"">didn&rsquo;t even keep pace with the growth nationwide.</a> By 2018, there were only <a href=""https://paworkstats.geosolinc.com/vosnet/lmi/profiles/profileDetails.aspx?enc=mLzjSNmrac3CLiUnnSSBItqi1/KvyGUX6e+AB3S/g25RLuVsPiIQsg0eb9PyTPXKjuZcqMitTSCwjmXyYDJSYw=="">4,500 jobs reported in the industry.</a></p>

<p>While gas jobs didn&rsquo;t grow nearly as much as promised, the industry was spectacularly effective at killing coal jobs. Since 2007, competition from the gas industry caused eleven coal-fired power plants to shut down and five more have announced they will close or convert to gas leaving only one large conventional coal plant in Pennsylvania yet to announce its end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the fracked gas industry had a solution for these job losses. In addition to the existing handouts on the supply side (i.e. lax regulations, no severance tax, etc.), they just needed a little more help&mdash;this time on the demand-side. If we just help create new markets for their gas, they claim, surely this time things will work out. Faster permitting and fewer regulations were still high priorities, but the industry also secured <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">well over a billion dollars in demand-side subsidies</a> for a new cracker plant to turn fracked gas into plastics and the recently announced gasoline refinery.</p>

<p>Having the state offer tax credits to companies that locate here is nothing new, but the petrochemical companies didn&rsquo;t want to compete with other industries for the handouts. Enter the Pennsylvania Resource Manufacturing tax credit and the similar Local Resource Manufacturing tax credit&mdash;special deals only available to companies that buy gas from the fracking industry. But even that isn&rsquo;t enough. Our legislature <a href=""https://www.timesleader.com/news/1516389/yudichaks-senate-committee-examines-pa-s-natural-gas-infrastructure"">recently held hearings</a> to rail about how failing to invest even more in fracked gas infrastructure, pipelines, and manufacturing technologies &ldquo;will devastate Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy,&rdquo; raise electricity prices, and various other claims.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Remember Supply and Demand?</u></p>

<p>The petrochemical industry and their friends in Harrisburg seem happy to have the citizens of Pennsylvania subsidize both the supply and demand side of gas operations, but what exactly are we trying to accomplish?</p>

<p>The glut of gas flooding the market during the fracking boom resulted in supply exceeding demand. That drove prices down and, as electricity generation shifted to this cheaper gas, electricity prices stayed flat too. Adjusted for inflation, average electricity prices in Pennsylvania last year were about the same as they were in 2005. In the process, we&rsquo;ve gone from less than 5% of our generation coming from gas before the fracking boom to more than 52% in 2020.</p>

<p>Now, with demand beginning to catch up with supply, prices are once again trending upwards. Henry Hub prices in October&nbsp;2021 were $5.51 per million BTU&mdash;a price we haven&#39;t seen since 2014. Not surprisingly, with our over-reliance on gas for generation, electricity prices are very sensitive to gas prices too and we are seeing sharp increases as well.</p>

<p>Fracked gas cheerleaders in the state legislature <a href=""https://www.pasenategop.com/blog/yudichak-senate-panels-examine-pas-natural-gas-infrastructure/"">want&nbsp;to blame increasing consumer prices</a> on environmental advocates who oppose massive subsidies for projects like Royal Dutch Shell&rsquo;s cracker plant in Beaver County, or the recently announced Nacero gasoline refinery in Luzerne County. Others openly advocate for increased gas shipments to Europe and other places. The fracked gas industry might be happy with those ideas, but how exactly is subsidizing projects that increase demand a win for consumers?</p>

<p>Anyone who took Economics 101 should recognize increasing demand will raise prices, not lower them. If we really want lower consumer prices, we should focus on improving energy efficiency and building new clean resources like wind and solar. That will not only control prices by lowering the demand for fracked gas, it will also protect our economy from over-dependence on fossil fuels and help address the growing climate crisis.</p>

<p><u>Looking back to where we started.</u></p>

<p>In much of the current gas-industry talking points, we&rsquo;ve lost track of where we started. At the beginning of the shale boom we were told about the riches that were right at our fingertips if we just gave the industry a little help. The industry took their profits, but didn&rsquo;t deliver the promised thousands of jobs and booming economy. Now we are told if we don&rsquo;t give them more, we&rsquo;ll never see those jobs and all the money we&rsquo;ve already poured in will be wasted.</p>

<p>If it was a self-described &ldquo;Nigerian Prince&rdquo; making those claims, we&rsquo;d (hopefully) be wary of the advance fee scam and the sunk-cost fallacy and cut our losses.&nbsp;</p>

"PennFuture, Partners Appeal Air Installation Permit for Proposed Gas-Burning Plant in Elizabeth Township",11/9/2021,"<p>The Allegheny County Health Department (“ACHD”) recently issued an air installation permit for a proposed Invenergy Allegheny Energy Center gas-fired power plant in Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County in Southwestern Pennsylvania. PennFuture, along with our partners the Environmental Integrity Project, Clean Air Council, and Mountain Watershed Association, appealed this permit to the ACHD Hearing Officer. </p>

<p>This facility would be a large, 639-wegawatt gas-fired power plant that would emit hundreds of tons of noxious pollutants and millions of tons of climate pollutants annually. If completed, this facility would be a major source of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and VOC emissions, and a minor source for particulate matter, PM10, PM2.5, sulfur dioxide, and hazardous air pollutants. A gas-fired power plant like this one would not only contribute to climate change and endanger public health and the environment through its direct emissions, but it would also perpetuate fracking in Pennsylvania and the further entrenchment of the fossil fuel industry in our region.  </p>

<p>The planned location for this facility is on the Youghiogheny River, near the edge of Allegheny County’s border with Westmoreland County. Emissions from the facility will impact residents in both counties, surrounding environmental justice communities, and residents of the nearby Mon Valley, who are already overburdened by pollution from industrial sources. Air pollution from this proposed plant will only exacerbate the region’s existing struggles with poor air quality from heavily polluting industries and further threaten public health.</p>

<p>We object to the installation permit on several grounds. The permit issued by ACHD would allow for unlawfully high levels of air pollution and excessive startup, shutdown, and malfunction events.  Further, the ACHD failed to properly conduct required analyses, in addition to other significant deficiencies with the permit, <a href=""https://cleanair.org/wp-content/uploads/2021.11.04-CAC-PennFuture-MWA-Notice-of-Appeal-Papers-with-Permit-0959-I001-for-Invenergy-AEC-final.pdf"">as detailed in our Notice of Appeal</a>. For more information, our full Notice of Appeal may be read here.</p>

<p>PennFuture is dedicated to protecting our air, water, and communities from the threats of the fossil fuel industry. By challenging ACHD’s issuance of the Invenergy AEC air permit, PennFuture continues to fight for clean air and a clean energy future for all of Pennsylvania.</p>

"During Press Conference, State Senators Openly Choose Profits Over Pennsylvanians, Our Environment",11/8/2021,"<p>They&rsquo;re getting nervous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 20, 2021, State Senators Camera Bartolotta, Gene Yaw, and Independent John Yudichak held a press conference at the Main Capitol Rotunda filled to the brim with falsehoods wrapped in package of clearly unscripted and unplanned maunders about a &ldquo;radical energy agenda,&rdquo; &ldquo;radical environmentalists,&rdquo; &ldquo;socialists&rdquo; (as a pejorative), and other immature nicknames aimed to conjure a boogeyman-type image of their opponents. It is clear that these Senators see the writing on the wall: <a href=""https://cleanair.org/rggi-poll/"">60% of voters approve</a> of Pennsylvania&#39;s efforts to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2021/06/22/poll-shows-pennsylvanians-support-climate-action-amid-pandemic/"">by a 51-31 margin</a>, Pennsylvanians believe the state should &ldquo;pursue policies that prioritize the availability of renewable energy such as solar and wind&rdquo; over fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Instead of doing the right thing on behalf of their hard-working constituents, these Senators are aiming to pit urban and suburban workers against rural workers, all while doing the bidding of the big dirty energy industry who line their campaign coffers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Debunking the New &ldquo;Rising Energy Bills&rdquo; Myth</u></p>

<p>A recently repeated talking point by these Senators revolves around rising energy prices, especially as we head towards the winter season and blaming the rise to &ldquo;environmentalists driving out fossil fuels.&rdquo; As with most of their points raised, this particular point is easily refuted with a simple Google search.&nbsp; <a href=""https://www.iea.org/commentaries/what-is-behind-soaring-energy-prices-and-what-happens-next"">According to the International Energy Agency (IEA)</a>, COVID-19 brought with it a historic plunge in global energy consumption which drove the prices of many fuels to their lowest levels in decades. As the pandemic&rsquo;s impact has declined, fuel prices have rebounded strongly, mainly as a result of an exceptionally rapid global economic recovery (this year is on track for the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/06/08/world-bank-global-economic-prospects-2021"">fastest post-recession growth in 80 years</a>), longer winter seasons in the Northern Hemisphere <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58425526"">due to increased climate change</a>, and a low supply due to the lockdowns earlier in the pandemic that have slowed down maintenance and necessary operational work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I have stated in previous posts, building new renewable energy <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2018/12/03/plunging-prices-mean-building-new-renewable-energy-is-cheaper-than-running-existing-coal/"">is cheaper than running existing coal plants</a> and prices get cheaper every year. By 2025, almost every existing coal plant in the United States <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2019/03/26/the-coal-cost-crossover-74-of-us-coal-plants-now-more-expensive-than-new-renewables-86-by-2025/#7f5abb5322d9"">will cost more to operate</a> than building replacement wind and solar within 35 miles of each plant. The (short term) <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2015/06/23/414926833/how-fracking-is-changing-the-nation-s-electrical-grid"">rise of the fracked gas industry</a> in Pennsylvania <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/29/natural-gas-killed-coal-now-renewables-and-batteries-are-taking-over"">has accelerated the death of the coal industry</a>. As we are already seeing, the costs of both economically unsustainable sources of energy are being shouldered onto the consumer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Debunking the &ldquo;RGGI Will Kill Jobs&rdquo; Myth</u></p>

<p>Senator Yaw got one thing right in this press conference: &ldquo;The environment and the economy are not mutually exclusive.&rdquo; Among RGGI&rsquo;s 11 current member states, RGGI <a href=""https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">has also created 45,000 jobs</a> across the region since the program&rsquo;s launch and <a href=""https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">added around $4 billion in economic value</a> to the region. Meanwhile, RGGI state economies <a href=""https://acadiacenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Acadia-Center_RGGI_10-Years-in-Review_2019-09-17.pdf"">have grown 31 percent faster</a> than non-RGGI states, even as the RGGI states have cut power plant carbon pollution nearly twice as fast as the rest of the nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have written <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-What-You-Wont-Hear-During-the-Aug-17-Public-Hearing-on-Pipelines-in-Pennsylvania"">not once</a>, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Its-Past-Time-for-Pennsylvania-to-Invest-in-Renewable-Energy"">but twice</a> since August of this year about the rise of alternative energy jobs in the U.S., including the ever-increasing competitiveness in terms of pay for workers in various green energy sectors. The renewable energy industry has become a major U.S. employer. E2&rsquo;s Clean Jobs America 2019 report found nearly 3.3 million Americans working in clean energy&mdash;<a href=""https://e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-america-2019/"">outnumbering fossil fuel workers by 3-to-1.</a> E2 reported <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2019/03/04/if-u-s-emissions-rose-in-2018-despite-clean-energy-growth-how-can-we-meet-climate-goals/?sh=5c372bdc11d9"">the fastest-growing jobs across 12 states</a> were in renewable energy during 2018, and renewable energy <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm"">is already the fastest-growing source</a> of new U.S. electricity generation, leading the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to forecast America&rsquo;s two fastest-growing jobs through 2026 will be solar installer (105% growth) and wind technician (96% growth).</p>

<p>A recent study <a href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/reports/2021/07/07/501280/clean-economy-revolution-will-unionized/"">published by the Sierra Club</a>, in partnership with the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, estimated that upgrading U.S. infrastructure, expanding renewable energy, and increasing energy efficiency could create 9.3 million jobs over the next 10 years.</p>

<p>Moreover, further supporting the unionization of alternative energy workers would be good for all workers across sectors and the overall U.S. economy. <a href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/reports/2021/07/07/501280/clean-economy-revolution-will-unionized/"">Unionization raises total compensation</a>&mdash;both wages and benefits&mdash;of union workers by an average of about 28 percent, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Just as &ldquo;the environment and the economy are not mutually exclusive,&rdquo; unionized labor, the environment, and economic prosperity can co-exist in harmony.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Debunking the &ldquo;We Need Fossil Fuels to Create Everyday Products&rdquo; Myth</u></p>

<p>Senator Yaw often repeats the fallacy that fossil fuels are a necessary part of the creation of televisions, windmills, solar panels, our food production, and other everyday items like make-up. However, sustainable ways to manufacture everyday items <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/smm-electronics/basic-information-about-electronics-stewardship"">have been outlined for years</a>. The major issue facing further sustainable practices in electronics manufacturing has come from <a href=""https://www.vttresearch.com/en/news-and-ideas/five-ways-towards-sustainable-electronics"">a lack of investment</a> in research, development, and implementation of new biodegradable materials and energy-efficient and material-efficient manufacturing techniques This is something <a href=""https://www.sierraclub.org/trade/what-green-new-deal"">a Green New Deal </a>(which these Senators and others relentlessly attack as &ldquo;socialist&rdquo;) would solve.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Leaving their Own Behind</u></p>

<p>Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) has not only detailed the benefits of renewable energy on the nation&rsquo;s economy, but they <a href=""https://rmi.org/renewables-offer-rural-america-the-economic-development-opportunity-of-a-generation/"">have repeatedly highlighted</a> how Appalachia, and Pennsylvania specifically, can stand the most to gain from a Clean Energy Economy. By 2030, US wind and solar is on track to generate more than $60 billion in annual revenue&mdash;on par with the three leading US agricultural commodities: corn ($58 billion), soy ($44 billion), and beef production ($70 billion). Analysis conducted for RMI&rsquo;s Seeds of Opportunity report indicates that the projected 600 GW of new wind and solar projects built between 2020 and 2030 <a href=""https://rmi.org/insight/seeds-of-opportunity/"">would generate $220 billion in direct, lifetime economic benefits</a>. This is a gamechanger for Rural America, of which much of Pennsylvania falls into.</p>

<p>These Senators spent the entire press conference adopting populist language while offering citizen-harming solutions and empty, fake promises. If these Senators really care about the worker, they would be actively working to secure their whole personhood -- promoting the proliferation of high-earning long term jobs, protecting their air, their water, and their land. It is past time they stop making excuses on behalf of a dirty energy past, and stand up for a clean, green Pennsylvania energy future.</p>

The Basics of Hydrogen,11/4/2021,"<p>Back in the 1970s and 1980s, the comedian Don Novello performed in character as Father Guido Sarducci.&nbsp;One of his famous bits was the Five Minute University where, in just five minutes, he would teach you everything the average college student remembers five years after graduation.&nbsp;For his Spanish class you would only learn the phrases &quot;&iquest;Como est&aacute; usted?&quot; and &ldquo;Muy bien&rdquo; figuring that you&rsquo;d probably forget the rest anyway. For economics, you would just learn &ldquo;supply and demand.&rdquo; <a href=""http://standupeconomist.com/"">Physics isn&rsquo;t as funny as economics</a>, but if that were included you&rsquo;d probably just need to remember &ldquo;conservation of energy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If that is the only thing anyone remembers from their science classes, it would be enough to understand why many of us are skeptical about hydrogen &ldquo;solving&rdquo; the climate crisis.</p>

<p><u>The challenge with hydrogen</u></p>

<p>Most of the hydrogen we use industrially today is made from methane (CH4)&mdash;the major component in fracked gas.&nbsp;Often called &ldquo;gray hydrogen&rdquo; this, not surprisingly, has significant environmental problems.&nbsp;Aside from all the energy used and pollution released in drilling and fracking for the methane, extracting the hydrogen creates carbon pollution as a waste product.&nbsp;Although people claim that carbon capture could reduce these emissions, that presents huge technical problems.&nbsp;Also, it should be clear that carbon capture is only going to make the resulting gas more expensive.</p>

<p>There is a cleaner alternative, known as &ldquo;green hydrogen,&rdquo; that is mostly produced by electrolysis&mdash;running electricity through water to split the H20 molecule into hydrogen and oxygen.&nbsp;Unlike gray hydrogen, if the electricity is obtained from a clean renewable source there are no dangerous emissions.&nbsp;The chemical formula for the process looks like this:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>2H20 + energy &rarr; 2H2 + O2&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>To get useful energy out of the resulting hydrogen fuel, we generally need to burn it.&nbsp;What we call &ldquo;burning&rdquo; is just something reacting quickly with oxygen and releasing a lot of heat. In the case of Hydrogen, that is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudCaJB_Xx4"">a very energetic reaction</a> and the chemical formula should look very familiar.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the opposite of electrolysis:</p>

<p><em>2H2 + O2 &rarr; 2H20 + energy</em></p>

<p>Conservation of energy tells us that the energy that comes out of that chemical reaction must come from somewhere.&nbsp;It did&mdash;it&rsquo;s the energy we had to add to split water into hydrogen and oxygen in the first place.&nbsp;It shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise that we can&#39;t get more energy out of the reaction than we put in.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Nobel prize winning <a href=""https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7246691M/Treatise_on_thermodynamics."">physicist Max Planck once wrote</a>, &ldquo;It is in no way possible, either by mechanical, thermal, chemical, or other devices, to obtain perpetual motion, i.e. it is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a cycle and produce continuous work, or kinetic energy, from nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u>We need action, not delay</u></p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean green hydrogen is useless&mdash;we just need to think of it more like a battery than a fuel, and this has some implications for our policy planning. We also need to be skeptical about some of the messaging we hear about hydrogen&mdash;particularly the claim that we are just using fracked gas or dirty hydrogen now, but sometime in the future when technology improves we will move to cleaner green hydrogen.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be obvious that if we can use clean energy directly, it doesn&#39;t make sense to turn it into green hydrogen first, and that isn&rsquo;t going to make sense in the future either.&nbsp;Planning to use fracked gas or dirty hydrogen on projects that we can electrify&mdash;even if we claim we are only doing it &ldquo;for now&rdquo;&mdash;just makes things worse.</p>

<p>It should also be obvious that doing essentially nothing while hoping a miracle technology will be developed that will fix the problem for us is irresponsible, unethical, and bad policy.&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is exactly the approach the fossil fuel industry is pushing to protect their profits for a few more years.&nbsp;It would be great if some new technology comes along to make decarbonization easier and cheaper, but after decades of inaction, we&rsquo;ve already wasted more time waiting and hoping than we had to spare.&nbsp;We have the tools and the technology to make significant progress in the fight against climate change right now&mdash;we just need the will to act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Potential uses for hydrogen by sector</u></p>

<p>If we are going to reduce carbon pollution, we need to pay attention to where those emissions are coming from in the first place.&nbsp;Then, we can think about the role a green hydrogen &ldquo;battery&rdquo; might play in reducing those emissions.&nbsp;The chart below shows emissions reported by the DEP in their <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=3925177&amp;DocName=2021%20PENNSYLVANIA%20CLIMATE%20ACTION%20PLAN.PDF%20%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:green%3b%22%3e%3c/span%3e%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:blue%3b%22%3e%28NEW%29%3c/span%3e%209/21/2023"">2021 Climate Action Plan</a> broken down into sectors.</p>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t surprise anyone that hydrogen projects have been proposed in all of these areas, but if we are going to prioritize resources and effort, we need to consider more than whether a particular use is technically possible.&nbsp;Ideally we want strategies that are economical compared to other zero-carbon alternatives and can scale sufficiently to make a significant difference.</p>

<p>The maxim that, if we can use clean energy directly, it doesn&#39;t make sense to turn it into hydrogen rules out a lot of uses in the electric generation sector.&nbsp;Hydrogen generation may come in handy getting electricity to locations where we can&rsquo;t run powerlines, and it may become an effective way to store surplus clean generation for when we need it, but it&rsquo;s not going to lessen the need for significantly more clean generation on our grid.</p>

<p>The residential sector isn&rsquo;t likely to be a key hydrogen market either.&nbsp;While it&rsquo;s technically possible to use hydrogen instead of gas for heating, cooking, and other applications, it&rsquo;s simpler and cheaper to electrify. Because hydrogen is a very tiny and light molecule it leaks at any opportunity, it&rsquo;s also incompatible with a lot of existing infrastructure. Large scale use of hydrogen would require we either retrofit or build out entirely new distribution networks both under our city streets and in many thousands of existing homes. That would be prohibitively expensive.</p>

<p>Transportation has more potential, although probably not for most light duty cars and trucks.&nbsp;Transportation always presents a chicken-and-egg problem where no one wants to buy a car without convenient refueling/recharging infrastructure and no one wants to invest in the infrastructure unless there are the cars around to use it.&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why natural gas vehicles, despite years of design and production, are rarely seen outside of centrally-fueled fleets.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hydrogen vehicles, particularly fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), have some distinct advantages over battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in terms of weight, range, and recharging times, so it&rsquo;s possible they could gain a foothold in the market.&nbsp;BEVs on the other hand are generally cheaper to operate, they can take advantage of a lot of existing infrastructure, and for many of us they are good enough in terms of range and other factors.&nbsp;Given their cost effectiveness and head start in the market, it seems likely BEVs will continue to oupace FCEVs, at least in the near term.</p>

<p>Outside of light duty vehicles, the case for hydrogen is stronger.&nbsp;Commercial applications that have centrally-fueled fleets and need rapid turn-around after refueling, such as transit vehicles and some trucking are promising areas for hydrogen.&nbsp;Also, while battery operated aircraft exist they are very limited in endurance and hydrogen might prove useful there too if the weight of storage tanks can be kept low enough.&nbsp;Similar applications may exist in the shipping and rail industries as well.&nbsp;To be sure, cutting all of these emissions are important, but cars and light trucks are the largest contributors to transportation emissions.</p>

<p>The commercial and industrial sectors also have significant potential.&nbsp;Most sources cite industries like cement making, steel manufacturing, and ammonia production as areas where hydrogen should be considered.&nbsp;There are likely many other applications as well but, while we shouldn&rsquo;t discount where hydrogen can be used to decarbonize commercial applications, we don&rsquo;t want to over-sell hydrogen as a solution either.</p>

<p>Like in transportation, generation, and other sectors hydrogen is most likely to be used in specific industrial applications that can&rsquo;t be plugged into the grid or, for some other reason, can&rsquo;t be readily electrified.&nbsp;While there could be thousands of different processes in the industrial sector that fit this bill, any one technology might only apply to a small handful of facilities. The big players like steel, cement, and ammonia may be on everyone&rsquo;s radar, but to really decarbonize the industry we are going need to dig a lot deeper.</p>

<p><u>How we move forward</u></p>

<p>Step number one is to stop making the problem worse.&nbsp;This means not subsidizing fossil fuels and new petrochemical projects&mdash;even if the backers promise that someday the fracked gas will be replaced by hydrogen.&nbsp;Every ton of carbon pollution we add is a ton we&rsquo;re going to need to remove later, and every piece of infrastructure we build is a potential stranded asset that tends to lock us into future fossil fuel use.</p>

<p>Step number two is to invest more in the technologies that are available today.&nbsp;This means building more wind and solar, adopting cost-effective energy efficiency measures, improving our grid and distribution network to support electrification, and replacing gas and diesel vehicles with EVs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Step number three is where we invest some limited resources in basic research and development of new technology.&nbsp;This is not because we are counting on a panacea that will solve the crisis&mdash;although that would be welcome.&nbsp;Research will be needed to find solutions for the hundreds of small issues we are sure to encounter along the way.</p>

<p>Like many things, controlling emissions often follows something like an 80/20 rule where that last 20% on the way to net zero emissions is likely going to be the most difficult.&nbsp;New approaches such as producing hydrogen from algae, waste, or other methods may find a niche in these cases.&nbsp;Similarly, new ways to store and transport hydrogen such as using liquid organic hydrogen carriers or other methods may find a role in our energy economy.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s prudent to keep the research and development in these areas going, but the important part now is not to get so hung up on the &ldquo;20% problems&rdquo; that we stop trying to deal with the 80% of emissions we can control today.</p>

<p>The topic of hydrogen can seem heavy and hard to digest. To help explain the issue more clearly, PennFuture partnered with the Ohio River Valley Institute on Nov. 28 to present an educational webinar to Pennsylvania advocates and leaders.

Connecting Pennsylvania with COP26,11/3/2021,"<p>The eyes of the world are turned to my adopted home away from home, Glasgow, now the beating heart of the planet for the next two weeks because of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26.&nbsp;The imperative for bold action on climate has never been greater.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania needs a good outcome from COP26, for a lot of exquisitely good reasons, but we live in a state very much dominated by fossil fuels, for centuries, so it&rsquo;s getting more and more complicated to extract climate leadership from one body you&rsquo;d typically expect leadership from &ndash; our state elected officials.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the science and the climate emergency and its links to the burning of coal, gas and oil, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fossil fuels interests have shown no sign of letting up &ndash; keeping up a steady drumbeat of climate denialism, and maintaining a good flow of contributions to politicians. They have lots of help from friendly state elected officials, mostly anti-environmental Republicans with very loud voices and influence in Harrisburg.&nbsp;Together these chums have revived the stereotype&nbsp;of branding as extreme those environmentalists promoting the expansion of renewable energy.&nbsp;They&rsquo;ve framed our ideas as a radical agenda that will destroy the state&rsquo;s energy industry.&nbsp;They&rsquo;ve successfully championed billions in tax credits and subsidies that deepen the state&rsquo;s reliance on the sector at taxpayer expense.</p>

<p>The fossil fuel industry, and their friends in labor and government have doubled down on fracking, petrochemicals and plastics.&nbsp;They view Pennsylvania&rsquo;s energy industry through the singular lens of fossil fuels, ignoring the myriad other sources, including a growing renewables portfolio, that make up our energy industry. And they never talk about the fact that the greener energy sector employs more people here than does the dirty energy sector.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the current state of affairs in that sector according to this most recent (Oct. 21, 2021) Energy Profile offered by the US Energy Information Administration (the emphases are mine):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Pennsylvania&#39;s marketed natural gas production, primarily from the Marcellus Shale, reached a <strong>record</strong> 7.1 trillion cubic feet in 2020, and the <strong>state is the nation&#39;s second-largest natural gas producer</strong> after Texas.</em></li>
	<li><em>Pennsylvania is the <strong>third-largest coal-producing</strong> state in the nation after Wyoming and West Virginia, and it is the <strong>second-largest coal exporter</strong> to foreign markets after West Virginia.</em></li>
	<li><em>In 2020, Pennsylvania ranked second in the nation after Illinois in electricity generation from nuclear power. However, natural gas generation surpassed nuclear generation in 2019 to provide the largest share of in-state electricity generation.</em></li>
	<li><em>Over half of Pennsylvania households use natural gas as their primary home heating fuel, and the state&#39;s <strong>49 underground gas storage sites--the most for any state</strong>--help meet regional heating demand in winter.</em></li>
	<li><em>Pennsylvania is the third-largest net supplier of total energy to other states, after Wyoming and Texas.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are some impressive rankings for our state, and I can understand the appeal of ongoing economic exploitation of Pennsylvania&#39;s fossil fuels.&nbsp;But the toll has become too great on our communities that boom and bust, blossom and shrivel depending on market manipulations.&nbsp;And, these fuels harm our bodies, our air, our children and our water, and desecrate our land.</p>

<p>But, all is not lost. Pennsylvania voices are breaking through in climate leadership, and some voices have been around for a long time.&nbsp;These individuals have embraced life-long personal missions toward climate action:&nbsp;Former PennFuture CEO Larry Schweiger of western Pennsylvania, former PennFuture board chair Char Magaro of Enola, and former board member Dr. Jim Jones of Mechanicsburg.&nbsp;No other scientist has been able to slice through industry lies that muddle the utter seriousness of the emergency than Dr. Michael Mann, climatologist, geophysicist, and director of PennState&rsquo;s Earth System Science Center, and PennFuture Board member.&nbsp;PennFuture board member Steve McCarter founded the House Climate Caucus while a member of the State House Legislature.&nbsp;U.S. Congressman Brendan Boyle will travel to Glasgow as part of Speaker Nancy Peolsi&rsquo;s delegation.&nbsp;And Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto has distinguished himself as an American climate leader standing up to Donald Trump and fossil fuel interests that targeted his city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are happy to report that several of these individuals will be joining us at noon on Tuesday, November 16 for a webinar to offer their reflections on COP26. This will be a chance for PennFuture&rsquo;s members to hear directly from those on the frontlines of climate action in Glasgow, and a chance for participants like Congressman Boyle and Mayor Peduto and others to offer their hopes and opinions on what comes next after COP26.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stakes couldn&rsquo;t be higher at COP26. Here&rsquo;s to hoping leaders like Boyle and Peduto have a front-row seat at COP26 to real, meaningful, and ambitious climate action, and that our world finally starts to take seriously the enormous task of combating the climate crisis.&nbsp;</p>

"DRBC Proposed Regulations Ban Discharge of Fracking Wastewater, Discourages Fracking-Related Interbasin Water Transfers",11/2/2021,"<p>Earlier this year, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) released final regulations <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fracking-Banned-in-Delaware-River-Basin"">that banned fracking in the watershed</a>, citing decades of scientific and technical studies, reports, and findings. This is a monumental step in the protection of our waters and health throughout the Delaware basin. Although litigation on DRBC&rsquo;s fracking ban <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Federal-Court-Dismissed-Lawsuit-Challenging-DRBCs-Ban-on-Fracking"">is ongoing</a>, PennFuture remains confident that these strong and necessary protections will withstand any legal challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time the fracking ban was announced, the DRBC also rescinded its previous draft regulations regarding fracking wastewater and interbasin water transfers. In our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Public-Comment-Closes-on-DRBC-Fracking-Regulations"">2018 comments</a> on the original draft regulations, PennFuture said that if these regulations couldn&rsquo;t be strengthened to ensure that the water resources of the basin would be protected, then DRBC has a duty to ban these activities within the watershed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, it appears that the DRBC was listening as these new proposed regulations prohibit the discharge of fracking wastewater, including co-products and byproducts, within the Delaware River watershed, whether on land or directly into the water. This ban includes the use of fracked wastewater &ldquo;brine&rdquo; spreading on dirt and gravel roads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is critical for the health of the waters, wildlife, ecosystems, and humans since fracked wastewater contains thousands of chemicals, many of which we don&rsquo;t even know about and some that can be <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-New-Report-Details-the-Use-of-Forever-Chemicals-in-Fracking-Operations-Despite-Serious-Concerns-to-Public-Health"">harmful</a>, toxic, or even <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Toxic-Fracking-Waste-Becomes-Mounting-Problem-for-Downstream-Communities"">radioactive</a>. This is also especially important for the upper Delaware basin where approximately <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.wordpress.com/"">80% of the commonwealth&rsquo;s Exceptional Value waters</a> and wetlands are located. A recent <a href=""http://www.paenvironmentdigest.com/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=53454&amp;SubjectID=58"">study by Penn State University</a> found that road spreading of oil and gas drilling wastewater is significantly less effective than commercial alternatives and increases the potential harm to aquatic systems, human health, and agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the new draft regulations continue the DRBC&rsquo;s position to &ldquo;discourage&rdquo; importation and exportation of waters to and from the basin (e.g., interbasin water transfers), and set out specific criteria that must be met in each case to be allowed by the DRBC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture is still reviewing these draft regulations, but at first glance it appears that the DRBC is taking seriously its authority &ndash; and duty &ndash; to protect the Delaware watershed from the inherent harms of fracking. We will be submitting written comments and participating in the proposed public hearings on these proposed regulations, and we encourage all of you to do the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The DRBC is seeking comments on the effects the proposed rules may have within the Delaware River Basin on the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>water availability;</li>
	<li>the control and abatement of water pollution;</li>
	<li>economic development;</li>
	<li>the conservation and protection of drinking water supplies;</li>
	<li>the conservation and protection of aquatic life;</li>
	<li>the conservation and protection of water quality in Special Protection Waters; and</li>
	<li>the protection, maintenance and improvement of water quantity and quality basinwide.</li>
</ul>

<p>The DRBC will also consider any other comments that concern the potential effects of the draft rules on the conservation, utilization, development, management and control of the water and related resources of the basin.</p>

<p>Written comments are due to the DRBC by 5:00pm on Friday, January 28, 2022, and must be submitted via the DRBC&rsquo;s online public comment collection system. More information and details on submission may be found <a href=""https://www.nj.gov/drbc/meetings/proposed/notice_import-export-rules.html"">at the DRBC&rsquo;s website.</a></p>

<p>Virtual public hearings will be held on the following Wednesdays in December:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>December 8, 2021, 2:30-4:30pm</li>
	<li>December 8, 2021, 6:30-8:30pm</li>

Planting Trees and Fighting for Funding in the Keystone State,10/29/2021,"<p>It might be the best way to clean our water. Planting trees along rivers and streams provides multiple benefits in the work to protect and restore our rivers and streams. Known as riparian buffers, they prevent pollution from entering waterways, stabilize stream banks, and provide critical habitat, shade, and food for critters. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s also one of the most cost-effective ways to improve water quality.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, PennFuture was thrilled to partner with the Choose Clean Water Coalition and&nbsp;the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay&nbsp;to host its first on-the-ground restoration event. Gathering on a Plain Sect dairy farm in Lancaster County on October 13, a group of 20 volunteers planted approximately 600 trees as part of a two-acre buffer on a direct tributary to the Conestoga River.</p>

<p>Buffers like this are an important part of Pennsylvania&#39;s Phase 3 Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) and are effective in both rural and suburban areas. According to the Phase 3 WIP, Pennsylvania has committed to plant more than 85,000 acres of buffers at a cost of $28 million annually. This would greatly improve local water quality by preventing 16 percent of nitrogen and 41 percent of phosphorous pollution from reaching our waterways. According to the 2021 numeric milestones, Pennsylvania has planted only 42 percent of its forest buffer goal.</p>

<p>But buffers are just one of many practices Pennsylvania has agreed to implement by 2025. Other necessary projects, such as manure storage, are much more expensive. Fortunately, in the Pennsylvania General Assembly there are two proposed pieces of legislation with broad bipartisan support that would invest a combined $750 million dollars of the American Rescue Plan Act funding in clean water programs.</p>

<p><u><strong>Growing Greener III</strong></u></p>

<p>First passed in 1999 with bipartisan support, Growing Greener continues to receive overwhelming public support today. In 2020, a poll commissioned by Conservation Voters of PA and the Growing Greener Coalition showed that nearly 90 percent of voters support funding for Pennsylvania&#39;s land, water, and wildlife, even during the economic downturn of the COVID-19 pandemic. Growing Greener funding provides critical support to community-driven work in our communities through grant programs at the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the PA Department of Agriculture. A boost of $500 million, as proposed in Senate Bill 525, from American Rescue Plan funding is much needed for this program.</p>

<p><u><strong>Clean Streams Fund</strong></u></p>

<p>But to reach its clean water goals, Pennsylvania must also invest state funds into clean water programs. A piece of legislation currently moving through the Pennsylvania state legislature would provide another source of crucial support to improve the Keystone State&#39;s waterways. The Clean Streams Fund (SB 832 and HB 1901) proposes $250 million in dedicated funding from the American Rescue Plan to create new clean water programs, including the Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program. This program would provide farmers funding to implement conservation practices on their land. Of Pennsylvania&#39;s 50,000+ farms, 98 percent of them are family-owned with an average net cash farm income of $42,020. With agriculture as the number one source of water pollution in Pennsylvania, the state must help farmers effectively steward their land by investing in conservation practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>A Worthwhile Investment&nbsp;</strong></u></p>

<p>The dairy farm where we planted the riparian buffer on October 13 is part of the Sustainable Dairy Pennsylvania project, a collaboration between The Hershey Company, Land O&#39; Lakes, and the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay focused on supporting a more sustainable and climate-friendly dairy supply chain in Pennsylvania for Hershey&#39;s Milk Chocolate.&nbsp;But getting conservation practices on-the-ground isn&#39;t free. Using American Rescue Plan funding through the Growing Greener III and passing the Clean Streams Fund will provide much needed assistance to our farmers. As many farmers have shared with us, by planting buffers and implementing other conservation practices, they are doing their part to ensure clean water for now and future generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We look forward to getting our hands dirty again at another planting, but until then, we will keep up the fight to ensure all Pennsylvanian farmers have the necessary resources to effectively steward their land and leave a legacy of clean water.</p>

"Plastics Could Soon Overtake Coal as a Climate Killer, and Pennsylvania is Right in the Middle of It",10/26/2021,"<p>A report released on Oct. 21 by Beyond Plastics <a href=""https://www.beyondplastics.org/plastics-and-climate"">predicted dire consequences</a> as a result of our inability to stop consuming plastics. Specifically, the report&rsquo;s authors claim that the domestic plastics industry&rsquo;s contribution to climate change is on track to exceed that of coal-fired power in this country by 2030.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve known for years that our oceans and other water bodies <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trash-removed-from-great-pacific-garbage-patch/"">are choked with unfathomable amounts of plastics pollution</a>, and that the process to create those plastics is dependent on fossil fuels, namely fracked gas. Even in an increasingly climate-conscious world, more than 300 million tons of plastic are produced each year,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/stories/single-use-plastics-101"">half of which is consumed as single-use</a>&mdash;products used once and tossed away (i.e. plastic bags), often finding their way to sidewalks, waterways, and green spaces.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t some far-away problem. The Keystone State is, after all, about to be home to the world&rsquo;s newest plastics factory once Shell Chemical&rsquo;s ethane cracker plant in Beaver County comes online sometime next year, a plant that is predicted to <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/shell-ethane-cracker-pennsylvania/shell-says-pennsylvania-ethane-cracker-about-70-complete-idUKL1N2H00V3"">churn out 1.6 million tons of plastic annually.</a> The plant won&rsquo;t just be responsible for introducing <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/plastics-appalachia-next-cancer-alley-fracking-public-health-ethane"">massive amounts of single-use plastic into the world</a>, but it will also pump <a href=""https://www.environmentalhealthproject.org/blog/the-health-behind-plastics-cracker-plants"">more than 30 tons of hazardous air pollutants</a>, 323 tons of fine particles, and 522 tons of volatile organic compounds into our air each year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Beyond Plastics report, therein lies the problem: the U.S. plastics industry already emits at least 232 million tons of greenhouse gases annually, which is equal to the emissions of 116 average-sized coal-fired power plants. Those numbers will increase significantly in the coming years&mdash;Shell&rsquo;s ethane cracker plant is only one of five cracker projects under construction or in the planning phases in the United States.</p>

<p>In total, at least 42 plastics facilities have opened, are under construction, or are in the permitting phase since 2019. If all of them <a href=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eda91260bbb7e7a4bf528d8/t/616ef29221985319611a64e0/1634661022294/REPORT_The_New-Coal_Plastics_and_Climate-Change_10-21-2021.pdf"">become fully operational</a>, they could cumulatively have the impact of 27 500-megawatt coal-fired power plants coming online by 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the petrochemical industry is slated to surpass coal in terms of climate-killing emissions by 2030 and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s dreams of becoming a petrochemical and plastics &ldquo;hub&rdquo; is part of the problem. We&rsquo;re building on our longer history of polluting and destructive industries&mdash;timber, oil, coal, and fracked gas&mdash;with plastics.</p>

<p>Massive ethane cracker facilities aren&rsquo;t the only culprits. The report specifically called out another sector of the plastics industry that Pennsylvanians should be familiar with: chemical recycling, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;advanced recycling,&rdquo; a complex process that involves turning plastic waste into fuel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be clear, despite the name, this is not true recycling of plastics in which plastics are turned into other plastics. Instead, it would take plastic waste, break it down to its chemical constituents, and burn it as a source of fuel (with associated air quality emissions).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though there are only a few chemical recycling facilities operational across the country, one is being proposed right here in Pennsylvania, in Erie. It&rsquo;s not currently clear what kinds of pollution could result from the Erie facility&mdash;all of the plastic sent to this facility will be turned into tiny flakes, half of which will be shipped or trucked to Canada and burned in steel mills. At this time, it is also unclear where the other half of the flaked plastic trash will go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We do know, however, that it&rsquo;s estimated that the facility will require <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/articles/a-rust-belt-city-debates-a-growing-plastic-future/"">about 400 truckloads of plastic per day</a> to stay profitable. We also know that chemical recycling facilities in the United States are predicted to be responsible for releasing 18 million tons of greenhouse gases annually, equivalent to nine coal-fired power plants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report paints a very dim picture of our ongoing relationship with plastics, and though Pennsylvania plays a significant role in this crisis, work is underway to fight back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture is one of several groups that&rsquo;s been <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/environmentalists-critical-of-natural-gas-storage-hub-in-southwest-pa-regional-plan/Content?oid=15288269"">working for years</a> to beat back attempts to turn Appalachia into a plastics hub. The Shell plant may be online soon, but other similar facilities planned for the region <a href=""https://businessjournaldaily.com/pttgc-delays-decision-on-belmont-cracker-plant/"">have been put on hold indefinitely</a> because of pushback from communities, and because of unfavorable market conditions as the world slowly becomes more climate-conscious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Progress can be seen in other nearby states, too. People in the state of New York <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/plastic-pollution-climate-change-1245402/"">once used 23 billion single-use plastic bags</a> annually, a number that is in steep decline because of a ban on plastic bags. PennFuture is supporting <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/phillys-plastic-bag-ban-is-finally-here-with-enforcement-still-to-come/"">a similar effort underway</a> in Philadelphia, and the hope is that the entire state could soon follow in banning plastic bags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, community members in Erie <a href=""https://www.eriereader.com/article/questions-surround-the-plasticity-of-our-city"">are questioning the viability</a> of the chemical recycling plant planned there, and many voices of civic society have fought&nbsp;back against <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/report-pa-s-fossil-fuel-industry-received-3-7-billion-in-tax-breaks-in-2019/"">any new subsidies for plastics and fossil fuels.</a>&nbsp;</p>

DEP Should Revoke Permits for Troubled Mariner East Pipeline,10/19/2021,"<p>On October 5, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced 48 criminal charges related to construction of the Mariner East pipeline project, including one felony count of failing to report pollution. Yes, you read correctly, a corporation is facing criminal charges for its behavior. So how did we get here, and what does that mean for Mariner East, its parent company Energy Transfer, and Pennsylvania? Read on.</p>

<p>Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based pipeline company building the Mariner East pipeline, has been plagued by a litany of problems. The pipeline project <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Problem-with-Pipelines"">has been rife with issues for years</a>, and this most recent evidence has shown that despite the numerous fines and temporary shutdowns Energy Transfer has faced from the Department of Environmental Protection, these issues have continued unabated, reaching a level where the Pennsylvania Attorney General himself took notice.</p>

<p>After a years-long investigation, a grand jury released its findings. The report details the numerous serious environmental harms that took place at specific locations across Pennsylvania, including Raystown Lake, Loyalhanna Lake, and Marsh Creek Lake. Highlights <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-10-05-Mariner-East-Presentment.pdf"">of the 64 page document include</a>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In its rush to begin construction, &ldquo;Sunoco and its prime contractors hired HDD subcontractors from across the country who were unfamiliar with Pennsylvania geology and water features as well as the regulatory landscape that existed in the state. The subcontractors applied their standard practices to an unusual environment, which resulted in environmental impacts.&rdquo; And that &ldquo;In addition to the problematic geology, this former Sunoco employee indicated that the people hired to do the work were young and with limited actual experience. Leaks and spills of drilling fluid began to occur almost immediately.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Elsewhere, in Indiana County, drilling was stopped after the DEP issued a Notice of Violation due to another spill. The day after work resumed, there was another spill, which was not reported. This exact story was replayed later in the report at a site in Cambria County: a large spill, contaminated wetlands, work stoppage after a DEP Notice, with the only result that &ldquo;the same thing happened again the next day.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>The scale of the leaks is difficult to wrap one&rsquo;s head around: these were not small and minor leaks of only a few gallons of toxic drilling fluid. At one site, near the William Penn Highway, a loss of 65,000 gallons of drilling fluid went unreported. Imagine nine yellow school buses lined up next to each other. This was not a small amount of water by any stretch, and it happened again and again.</li>
	<li>The report details testimony from a number of homeowners that Energy Transfer threatened to take their homes if they didn&rsquo;t give Energy Transfer the right to build the pipeline across their land, sometimes promising they wouldn&rsquo;t feel the effects of construction. Later, Energy Transfer threatened to take their houses when those whose water had been ruined tried to assert their rights.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>On top of leaking drilling fluid across the state, Energy Transfer used unapproved chemicals in that drilling fluid, meaning that not only did they leak chemicals into people&rsquo;s wells and lakes, they did not even have permission to use those chemicals in the first place.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these massive, systemic, and ongoing problems were carefully recorded by inspectors and geologists on site. These records were simply unreported to the DEP.</p>

<p>Further, and even more offensive, is that Energy Transfer straight-up lied to the DEP about the incidents: In an April 24, 2019 letter to DEP, Sunoco claimed that, due to inadvertent miscommunication, its management never learned of the losses of fluid. However, the evidence before the Grand Jury clearly indicated that this claim was &ldquo;false.&rdquo; In fact, a project manager for one drilling subcontractor told the Grand Jury that if something was not reported, it was not because people were not there to see it. Another Construction Manager testified that it was &ldquo;preposterous&rdquo; for someone to imply that Energy Transfer&rsquo;s environmental team was unaware. Despite the citizen complaints, the obvious spills, and its own records, Energy Transfer tried to claim they somehow went unaware.</p>

<p>As the infamous saying goes, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you gonna believe: me, or your own lying eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The numerous, severe, repeated violations noted by the Grand Jury report&mdash;the details span over 50 pages&mdash;only encompass a mere 16% of the total number of horizontal drilling sites of the project. One wonders how long the Grand Jury report would be if even half of the sites were investigated.</p>

<p>So what does all this mean? First, we applaud the Attorney General for taking action against Energy Transfer, to try and bring some greater consequence to Energy Transfer, and to shine a brighter light onto their multitude of transgressions. It isn&rsquo;t often that corporations themselves are held accountable for their actions, and we believe this to be a good step in the right direction here. Ultimately, we need to strengthen the laws themselves so that when the Attorney General needs to prosecute, they have a stronger sword with which to do so.</p>

<p>Second, one of the other crucial takeaways from the Grand Jury Report is that the Department of Environmental Protection was entirely too under-resourced to be able to effectively administer and oversee the level of violations here. This shows something that matches our common sense: it isn&rsquo;t enough to simply pass regulations, but the agencies charged with carrying out laws and regulations must be provided with enough resources to effectively oversee them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the Department of Environmental Protection can still take swift and decisive action here to prevent even more harm. A number of advocates have called for the DEP to terminate Energy Transfer&rsquo;s environmental permit, which allows them to do the work that is leaving a trail of environmental ruin and carnage in its wake.</p>

<p>The legal standard for the Department of Environmental Protection to terminate a permit is simple: When a permittee either has been shown to be in noncompliance with any condition of their permit, or the permittee misrepresents &ldquo;any relevant facts at any time,&rdquo; a permit can be terminated. How does this process start? That is also simple: either a person submits a written request that the permit be terminated, or information showing that there has been noncompliance is brought to the DEP&rsquo;s attention, and they can take action of their own accord. The DEP can then begin the process of terminating the permit. It is clear that this simple legal standard has been met.</p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Protection should terminate the permits associated with the Mariner East pipeline immediately.</p>

<p>So what can you do today? <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/marinereast2permits/index.html"">Write to your representatives</a>, and ask them to increase funding for long term oversight of environmental permits, and ask them what they are doing to make sure that Energy Transfer is not allowed to further poison the water and resources of hard working Pennsylvanians.</p>

It's Past Time for Pennsylvania to Invest in Renewable Energy,10/5/2021,"<p>On October 4, 2021, the Pennsylvania State Senate Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committee and the Senate Community, Economic &amp; Recreational Development Committee held a joint-committee hearing titled &ldquo;Consumer &amp; Economic Impacts of Failing to Invest in PA&#39;s Natural Gas Infrastructure.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of highlighting the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry over the past few decades, how it has led to the degradation of our shared environment, and the subsequent harmful effects on our health, the Majority Chairs quickly began dismissing these issues, pointing fingers at the &ldquo;radical environmental left,&rdquo; and scapegoating other countries.</p>

<p>Experts have stated repeatedly that merely pointing out that other, industrialized countries are also sources of high carbon pollution does not absolve the US of responsibility or somehow make any attempts by the US to reduce their carbon emissions meaningless. Also, many scapegoaters, including those leading the hearing yesterday afternoon, leave out key facts about these aforementioned countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China plans to increase their share of non-fossil fuel energy consumption <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/trump-admin-scapegoats-china-india-satisfy-polluters"">to 20 percent by 2030</a>. China is already the world leader in new installations <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/13/china-and-us-lead-way-with-wind-power-installations-says-global-energy-report.html"">of wind</a> and <a href=""http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2017/01/06/china-five-year-plan-energy-solar-record-2016/"">solar power</a>. India is increasing their share of non-fossil fuel energy consumption to 40 percent by 2030. India plans to add <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/sameer-kwatra/india-joins-paris-agreement-climate-change"">175 gigawatts of renewable energy</a> by 2022. Also, India plans to reduce emissions intensity 33 to 35 percent by 2030 based on 2005 levels. The US must do its part to reduce its carbon footprint because the average emissions for every American <a href=""http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts_pc1990-2015"">is eight times that of the average Indian citizen</a>. Similarly, the emissions per person in China <a href=""http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts_pc1990-2015"">is only half that</a>&nbsp;of the average American, and a bit more than residents of the EU. Overall, the average emissions per American <a href=""http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts_pc1990-2015"">are three times higher</a> than the global average.</p>

<p>However, as is the position of PennFuture, the burden to curb carbon emissions is not on the average individual, but on producers and polluters -- namely the fossil fuel industry.</p>

<p>In February 2021, PennFuture released the third edition of our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Publications/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">Fossil Fuel Subsidy Report</a>. In this report, we uncovered that Pennsylvania provided $3.8 billion in fossil fuel subsidies in Fiscal Year 2019 by systematically disabling many of its standard tools for collecting tax revenues, allowing the industry to extract public resources at little to no charge, and awarding the industry grants and tax credits. Meanwhile, in the same time period, the industry imposed $11.1 billion worth external costs to the state and its residents. These facts alone plainly show the nonsensical nature of the premise of the hearing itself; it was a waste of taxpayer money that is better served being invested in our workers, our environment, and our future. It is more than clear to us that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s continued investment in the fracked gas industry is harmful to workers, businesses, and the general public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recognize the need to secure the livelihood of Pennsylvanians, especially in this volatile time as the country as a whole begins the long road of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we also recognize that this recovery period is a source of opportunity. Pennsylvania, as many other states and nations already have, can leap to the forefront of the new, clean energy economy and provide hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs in a diverse number of sectors for the people across this great Commonwealth.</p>

<p>A better path forward doesn&rsquo;t lie in some far-off future, it is already here, and it is time for our great Commonwealth to seize this opportunity through heavily and seriously investing in the New Clean Economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Transitioning to the New Clean Economy is Good for the Overall Economic Development in Pennsylvania</u></p>

<p>A major point made by the leaders of yesterday&rsquo;s hearing was how going after the fossil fuel industry would result in higher costs to the consumer and a loss of jobs for the workers in the industry. However, these leaders conveniently leave out, time and time again, that carbon-polluting jobs <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2020/06/05/pandemic-accelerates-decline-and-fall-of-fossil-fuel-producers/?sh=6689dc97f639"">have been on the decline</a> as the industry itself continues to give way to the new, clean energy economy. They also fail to mention how clean energy is, in many cases, cheaper to produce (and thus cheaper to the consumer) than fossil fuel-based energy. It would be in the best interests of labor unions and their workers alike to embrace the new economy, which offers <a href=""https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/09/how-much-do-energy-industry-jobs-pay-a-look-at-the-data/"">better job security</a>, increasing wages, and is overall beneficial to the environment and general public.</p>

<p>In a blog post from August <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-What-You-Wont-Hear-During-the-Aug-17-Public-Hearing-on-Pipelines-in-Pennsylvania"">about a similar hearing held in the State House</a>, I discussed how greener, more environmentally friendly energy alternatives are already proving to not only be both <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=5128549c2c84"">cost effective for producers and consumers</a>, but also offer <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimmagill/2020/10/26/oil-gas-vs-clean-energy-which-will-have-best-jobs-in-the-future/?sh=51d9704c5738"">higher-paying wages</a> for those in the green energy job sector. I pointed out how wind energy prices have fallen 70% and solar photovoltaics have fallen 89% on average, <a href=""https://www.lazard.com/perspective/lcoe2019"">according to a 2019 report</a>. Utility-scale renewable energy prices <a href=""https://energyinnovation.org/2018/01/22/renewable-energy-levelized-cost-of-energy-already-cheaper-than-fossil-fuels-and-prices-keep-plunging/"">are now significantly below</a> those for coal and gas generation.</p>

<p>Experts and analysts <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/06/09/plunging-renewable-energy-prices-mean-us-can-hit-90-clean-electricity-by-2035at-no-extra-cost/?sh=54f12a7d2f9b"">have claimed that</a>, with wind, solar, and storage prices <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/#7cbce6f2c84e"">falling at such a fast rate</a>, the United States can reach 90% clean electricity by 2035 without raising customer costs at all from today&rsquo;s levels, and actually decreasing wholesale power costs 10%. Jobs in solar and wind <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimmagill/2020/10/26/oil-gas-vs-clean-energy-which-will-have-best-jobs-in-the-future/?sh=51d9704c5738"">pay about 50 cents more</a>. Specifically, wind and solar electricians (HVAC technicians, mechanics, welders and assemblers) <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimmagill/2020/10/26/oil-gas-vs-clean-energy-which-will-have-best-jobs-in-the-future/?sh=51d9704c5738"">get paid $2.50 more than their counterparts</a> in the dirty energy space. Clean energy jobs are more likely to be union jobs than jobs across the economy as a whole &ndash; <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimmagill/2020/10/26/oil-gas-vs-clean-energy-which-will-have-best-jobs-in-the-future/?sh=51d9704c5738"">9 percent versus 6 percent</a> &ndash; which correlates to higher pay and better benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building new renewable energy <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2018/12/03/plunging-prices-mean-building-new-renewable-energy-is-cheaper-than-running-existing-coal/"">is cheaper than running existing coal plants</a> and prices get cheaper every year. By 2025, almost every existing coal plant in the United States <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2019/03/26/the-coal-cost-crossover-74-of-us-coal-plants-now-more-expensive-than-new-renewables-86-by-2025/#7f5abb5322d9"">will cost more to operate</a> than building replacement wind and solar within 35 miles of each plant.</p>

<p>The renewable energy industry has become a major U.S. employer. E2&rsquo;s Clean Jobs America 2019 report found nearly 3.3 million Americans working in clean energy&mdash;<a href=""https://e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-america-2019/"">outnumbering fossil fuel workers by 3-to-1</a>. E2 reported the <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2019/03/04/if-u-s-emissions-rose-in-2018-despite-clean-energy-growth-how-can-we-meet-climate-goals/?sh=5c372bdc11d9"">fastest-growing jobs across 12 states</a> were in renewable energy during 2018, and renewable energy is already <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm"">the fastest-growing source of new U.S. electricity generation</a>, leading the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to forecast America&rsquo;s two fastest-growing jobs through 2026 will be solar installer (105% growth) and wind technician (96% growth).</p>

<p>U.S. coal consumption <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692"">fell 4% in 2018 to its lowest point</a> in 39 years due to accelerating coal plant closures and reduced coal plant utilization. The electric power sector <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38632"">represented 93% of total U.S. coal consumption</a> from 2007 to 2018, but over that period 68 GW of coal-fired generation (out of 313 GW in 2007) retired, capped by 13 GW of retirements in 2018.</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) has not only detailed the benefits of renewable energy on the nation&rsquo;s economy, <a href=""https://rmi.org/renewables-offer-rural-america-the-economic-development-opportunity-of-a-generation/"">but they have repeatedly highlighted</a> how Appalachia, and Pennsylvania specifically, can stand the most to gain from a Clean Energy Economy. By 2030, US wind and solar is on track to generate more than $60 billion in annual revenue&mdash;on par with the three leading US agricultural commodities: corn ($58 billion), soy ($44 billion), and beef production ($70 billion). Analysis conducted for RMI&rsquo;s Seeds of Opportunity report indicates that the projected 600 GW of new wind and solar projects built between 2020 and 2030 <a href=""https://rmi.org/insight/seeds-of-opportunity/"">would generate $220 billion in direct, lifetime economic benefits</a>. This is a gamechanger for Rural America, of which much of Pennsylvania falls into.</p>

<p>Specifically, onshore wind and utility-scale solar projects can result in $2.7 billion in tax revenues collected by local governments annually; $2.2 billion collected in land lease payments to rural landowners hosting turbines or panels on their property; $2.3 billion in construction jobs and wages; and $3.7 billion in operations and maintenance jobs and wages, <a href=""https://rmi.org/renewables-offer-rural-america-the-economic-development-opportunity-of-a-generation/"">all occurring annually by 2030</a>.<br />
As America faces an economy post-COVID 19, the green energy sector presents an avenue to create jobs on a massive, interstate scale <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/09/10/how-clean-energy-jobs-can-power-an-equitable-covid-19-recovery/"">that includes a diverse workforce of people</a> with varying levels of education and skill set.</p>

<p>In July 2020, PennFuture released a report titled <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Green-Stimulus-FINAL.pdf"">A Green Stimulus and Recovery Platform for Pennsylvania</a> which detailed how transitioning to a green energy future would preserve or create 389,000 good paying and environmentally sustainable jobs in a variety of sectors and types such as tourism, blue-collar, and white-collar jobs&mdash;including detailed steps our legislature can take to make this a reality.&nbsp; Such a new economy cannot be realized without proper investment, and Pennsylvania, facing the brunt of the dying fossil fuel industry, is the perfect place to rise to the moment and invest.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has a legacy of environmental damage from extractive industries including timber, oil, coal, and gas. In response, we passed a Constitutional amendment, Pa. Const. Art. I &sect; 27, acknowledging our fundamental right to clean air and pure water and requiring that the government act as a trustee with the duty to conserve and maintain our environment and our shared public natural resources. The threats associated with climate change only add to the urgency of this duty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of doubling down on an unsustainable and dirty fracked gas industry, Pennsylvania must work to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote alternatives such as energy efficiency and clean renewable energy. To do so, we must align our investments with our goals and avoid unintended side effects that promote pollution and poison our communities and our workers. This is a significant undertaking, but as a start PennFuture recommends the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Regular and ongoing evaluation of the costs and benefits of the fracked gas and fossil fuel subsidies: As time and technology changes, subsidies that were once justified may no longer make sense. Regular reconsideration of existing subsidies is needed to ensure we are spending money wisely and working towards our goals.</li>
	<li>Engaging in discussions with statewide, national, and international leaders in the renewable energy space: As renewable energy companies continue to establish themselves as leaders in the ever-growing clean energy economy, it would be wise for Pennsylvania economic development leaders to engage in job-creation centered dialogue in order to foster a robust and diverse clean energy sector in this great Commonwealth.</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe Pennsylvania can build a vibrant and growing economy on clean and renewable energy. We ask our lawmakers to take the needs of all Pennsylvanians seriously, do the right thing, and lead us to that New Clean Economic future by investing in renewable energy industries and jobs.</p>

PennEast Pipeline is Cancelled!,9/30/2021,"<p>Earlier this week it was announced that the PennEast Pipeline company <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/penneast-end-development-pennsylvania-new-jersey-natgas-pipe-2021-09-27/"">will cease development of its proposed fracked gas pipeline</a> determining that &ldquo;further development of the project no longer is supported.&rdquo; The 120-mile, 36-inch diameter pipeline, which was slated to run from Luzerne County in northeast Pennsylvania through the Delaware River watershed to New Jersey, was unable to get all necessary environmental permits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture responded to this announcement <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Responds-to-PennEast-Pipeline-Cancelation"">with relief for our environment and communities</a> and thanks for everyone who fought against this pipeline!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The decision to cease development of the PennEast pipeline came as a welcome surprise, especially since the company <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Supreme-Court-Ruled-Natural-Gas-Companies-Can-Condemn-State-Owned-Land"">just won a big case</a> with the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed the company to use eminent domain on state-owned or controlled lands in New Jersey. We knew something was going on when, despite that win, PennEast decided to <a href=""https://www.mcall.com/news/pennsylvania/mc-nws-pa-penneast-pipeline-eminent-domain-halted-20210810-q3ub2gijazgxthvetqd4sqn2qa-story.html"">stop condemnation proceedings</a> in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Condemnation occurs when the private property is taken for public use and the landowner is given &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; for that property. In 2017, we joined with Save Carbon County and others to <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Environmental-Impacts-and-the-PennEast-Pipeline"">highlight the unfair practices</a> in which pipeline companies may condemn private lands for pipeline right-of-ways even before the pipeline route is finalized. Once condemned, the pipeline company may access the property to do surveys and <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/07/03/family-lost-hundreds-of-trees-to-failed-pipeline-project-settles-with-company-gets-land-back/"">may even destroy some of the natural resources</a> on the land, like by clearcutting trees along the proposed right-of-way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, PennFuture has been concerned with the PennEast pipeline&rsquo;s environmental impacts since its inception in 2014. Impacts from the PennEast pipeline would have included degradation of streams, including special protection waters; loss of high functioning wetlands; destruction of forest habitat and increased invasive species; and increased greenhouse gas emissions, among other things. PennFuture - both individually as well as with others, including our key partners Delaware Riverkeeper Network (DRN) and Clean Air Council - have submitted numerous public comments opposing the various federal and state approvals the PennEast pipeline needed.&nbsp; Additionally, among other actions taken, PennFuture intervened in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and our ally DRN has brought numerous legal challenges against PennEast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many other local, regional, state, and federal groups fought against the destructive PennEast pipeline. As result of this strong opposition, New Jersey had recently denied critical environmental permits for the pipeline. This caused PennEast to propose to bifurcate its process and build the PA-only portion of the pipeline in phases to allow for construction to move forward, despite it being a <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PennEast-Chs.-102---105-Comments-Jan.-2021-.pdf"">pipeline to nowhere</a>, as PennFuture pointed out in our comments on the &ldquo;Phase One Amendment&rdquo; proposal. And while PennEast <a href=""https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/allentown/2021/09/penneast-pipeline-co-halts-its-natural-gas-transmission-line-crossing-lehigh-valley.html"">has stated</a> that it is &ldquo;examining the proper next steps in the regulatory process as it pertains to the Phase One Amendment pending at FERC,&rdquo; we believe that the PennEast pipeline is dead in PA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No doubt that the sustained legal, regulatory, and outreach efforts of PennFuture and our partners resulted in the necessary delay of construction of this project. And New Jersey&rsquo;s forceful recognition of the environmental harms of this pipeline and their denial of key permits was critical to PennEast inability to quickly push this pipeline through. But I don&rsquo;t think we can overlook the fact that this decision came from PennEast - and not the courts. This appears to be a business decision rather than a conclusive legal holding that the pipeline cannot be built. Because we are now at a time when market forces show that investment in fracked gas <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fracked-Gas-Petrochemical-Industries-Continue-to-Overpromise-and-Underdeliver-for-Pennsylvanians&#8203;"">is no longer as profitable as it once was</a>, such fierce and coordinated opposition seems to be working to halt the fracked gas industry from proposing facilities that may be operating on the margins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Pennsylvanians cannot rely on market forces, private business decisions, or other states to protect us from harmful fracked gas and petrochemical facilities. Our Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) must do everything it can to live up to its name and protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment. The DEP is a trustee under <a href=""https://blogs.law.widener.edu/envirolawcenter/files/2010/03/PA_Citizens_Guide_to_Art_I_Sect_27.pdf"">PA&rsquo;s Environmental Rights Amendment</a> (ERA), Article I, Section 27 of our state constitution. The ERA puts our right to &ldquo;clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment&rdquo; on par with other First Amendment rights like free speech. Thus, DEP must take seriously its fiduciary obligation to &ldquo;conserve and maintain [Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources] for the benefit of all the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To continue to issue approvals to an industry that we have seen <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/mariner-east-2/"">time</a> and <a href=""https://www.fractracker.org/2021/03/shells-falcon-pipeline-under-investigation-for-serious-public-safety-threats/"">time</a> and <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/09/10/natural-gas-pipeline-blast-in-beaver-county-prompts-evacuation/"">time again</a> destroy our environment and threaten the health and safety of our communities violates that fiduciary duty of the trustee. Rather, DEP must look critically at applications and promises made and must use its permitting process to ensure that construction and operation of pipelines will not harm our environment. DEP must continue to issue strong enforcement actions against these companies when - and in PA it appears to be when, not if - they destroy our waters, our lands, our communities.</p>

<p>To end on a positive note, PennFuture is very happy that the PennEast pipeline no longer seems to be a threat in Pennsylvania. This news is a huge relief for PennFuture and the impacted communities across the Delaware River watershed who have been tirelessly working to defeat this terrible pipeline. We couldn&rsquo;t have gotten here without the support of our partners, supporters, and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/donate"">members.</a> And we will continue to fight to protect our communities from the harmful impacts of the fracked gas and petrochemical industries.</p>

When Profits are on the Line: The Fight Over Energy Markets,9/29/2021,"<p>Having energy available when we flip on a light switch is a complicated business and making the wrong choices can have serious consequences. In Pennsylvania, these choices are often made by our Regional Transmission Organization (RTO)&mdash;a nonprofit organization known as <a href=""https://www.pjm.com/"">PJM Interconnection</a>.&nbsp;They manage a large marketplace providing services in an area touching 13 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>In the short term, many key decisions are made through auctions.&nbsp;PJM forecasts how much energy we will need tomorrow, and generators bid to see who can provide that energy at the lowest cost.&nbsp; The cheapest generators clear the auction and everyone receives the market clearing price.&nbsp;If additional energy is needed over the course of a day, PJM also has a spot market that runs a similar auction every five minutes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
While this system works very well and most generators make the bulk of their revenue from these markets, it doesn&rsquo;t provide any long-term price signals to ensure the capacity we need is built and maintained.&nbsp;Relying only on short-term markets to influence long-term behavior is a bad idea&mdash;this was one of the primary causes of the <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/why-texas-power-grid-failed-2eaa659d2ac29ff87eb9220875f23b34"">high-profile and catastrophic failures</a> the Texas grid experienced in recent months.&nbsp;Fortunately, PJM doesn&rsquo;t follow the Texas plan.</p>

<p>PJM has what is known as a Capacity Market in addition to the energy markets.&nbsp;Under the Capacity Market, generators who clear the market commit to be available, if needed, three years in the future in exchange for set payments.&nbsp;They receive the capacity payments whether or not they actually are called upon to deliver energy, but they are also liable for penalties if they are not able to run when called.&nbsp;This gives them both time to plan and incentives to be reliable.</p>

<p>Prior to December 2019, PJM was concerned that some market participants with buyer-side market power could manipulate the market.&nbsp;For example, a load-serving entity that built new power plants could dump new generation into the capacity market at artificially low prices. They might lose money on those plants, but if it drove the market clearing price low enough, they could more than make up for those losses buying the capacity they need at cheaper prices.&nbsp;To prevent this sort of manipulation, PJM set a price floor for certain new generation.&nbsp;They called this the Minimum Offer Price Rule or &ldquo;MOPR.&rdquo; (pronounced m&#333;p-er)</p>

<p>Since 2019, another type of possible market influence arose.&nbsp;Maryland wanted to encourage new in-state generation so it created a program where a company would bid into the PJM capacity market but, in addition to its capacity revenue, it would also receive out-of-market payments to make up the difference between the market clearing price and a pre-arrange contract price.&nbsp;The Supreme Court <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-614_k5fm.pdf"">rejected this program</a>, holding that Maryland&rsquo;s plan disregarded an interstate wholesale rate required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).</p>

<p>This decision was very limited.&nbsp;Although it rejected a type of market influence by the state, the Court explicitly said that &ldquo;Nothing in this opinion should be read to foreclose...states from encouraging&nbsp; production of new or clean generation...so long as a state does not condition payment of funds on capacity clearing the auction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, then President Trump&rsquo;s FERC ignored this clarification and claimed that practically any effort by the state to make policy decisions about their resource mix &ldquo;threaten[s] the competitiveness of the capacity market.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a result of this new FERC decision, PJM was ordered to expand the MOPR well beyond the initial purpose of limiting buyer-side market power.&nbsp;The expanded MOPR would include practically any &ldquo;state-subsidized&rdquo; resource, whether or not the subsidy was conditioned on a generator clearing the capacity market.&nbsp;These targeted subsidies would have a disproportionate impact on new clean renewable generation like those sources benefiting from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s alternative energy portfolio standards (AEPS), forcing new clean resources to bid into the capacity market at uncompetitively high prices.</p>

<p>Rather than supporting an efficient market, this created a fiction where PJM would effectively pretend that these clean resources didn&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp;Not only would that raise the capacity prices across the board, it also meant ratepayers would be forced to pay for more capacity than was actually needed.&nbsp;Or, as PJM put it &ldquo;attempting to &lsquo;hermetically seal&rsquo; the capacity market from the reality of state policies...effects an over-correction that itself works against the determination of just and reasonable rates.&rdquo;&nbsp;By 2030, this could mean $2 billion per year in excess payments that would largely flow into the coffers of polluting generators and extend the life of uncompetitive and unneeded fossil fuel plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But prices didn&rsquo;t increase in our last capacity auction!&rdquo; comes the cry from the polluters.&nbsp;In reality, that is a distraction rather than a vindication for the expanded MOPR.&nbsp;First, because of the various changes, PJM delayed the last auction for two years allowing for a much more accurate forecast of needed capacity and the need for less reserves, as a result, they bought 2.5GW less capacity saving ratepayers <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/tom-rutigliano/how-save-four-billion-without-really-trying"">over $4 billion</a>. Second, the vast majority of existing resources were grandfathered, so no one seriously expected the MOPR to show large effects in the first few auctions anyway. While ratepayers did get a huge break, the MOPR system was still broken.</p>

<p>While all four of the current FERC commissioners were appointed by the former President, it is a very different body than it was in 2019.&nbsp;Right now, there is an even split with two Democrats and two Republicans, and a fifth commissioner&mdash;a third Democrat&mdash;has been nominated by President Biden and is expected to be confirmed by the Senate later this year.&nbsp;President Biden also named Commissioner Richard Glick, who dissented in the prior opinion, as the new Chairman replacing Niel Chatterjee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the expanded MOPR deeply unpopular and support at FERC for that approach waning, PJM saw the handwriting on the wall and, earlier this year, held a series of workshops to discuss alternatives.&nbsp;This ended with the consideration of nine different proposals to reform the MOPR.&nbsp;After putting the options to various stakeholder groups, PJM&rsquo;s own plan was clearly the most popular.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This would only apply the MOPR to facilities that actually exercised buyer side market power or those receiving &ldquo;conditioned state support&rdquo;&mdash;the narrow category specifically identified by the Supreme Court.&nbsp; PJM proposed to adopt this plan in July and, with the FERC commissioners split two against two on the change, FERC took no action.&nbsp;The revisions <a href=""https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_num=20210929-3009"">became effective by operation of law</a> on September 29, 2021.</p>

<p><u>Panic from the fossil fuel industry</u></p>

<p>PJM revising a fairly obscure rule in a way that would save ratepayers billions of dollars doesn&rsquo;t seem controversial, but shortly before the new rule took effect, the PA House Environmental Resources and Energy (ERE) Committee, led by the irascible Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, held an entire hearing to rail against this new plan and the danger of &ldquo;subsidies&rdquo;.&nbsp;He seemed to be under the impression that this was somehow orchestrated by President Biden even though Trump appointed all of the current FERC commissioners. (Richard Glick, who Daryl kept referring to as &ldquo;Biden&rsquo;s appointee,&rdquo; was the Trump appointee who Biden named as Chairman.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following day the PA State Senate ERE committee held a meeting on the same topic, with largely the same speakers.&nbsp;Many Senators also took the opportunity to object to other states investing in new renewable generation even though doing so would actually lower electricity costs for their constituents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why would two legislative committees feel the need to go on record advocating for a plan to raise their constituent&rsquo;s electric bills right before an election year? If you suspect the fossil fuel industry has a hand in this, you would be right.</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s a good thing we don&rsquo;t follow the Texas model and rely on short-term markets to drive investments, our Capacity Market has its own problems, perhaps the biggest of which is systematic over-procurement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take for example the Cheswick coal-fired power plant in Allegheny County.&nbsp;In 2020 it was only called upon to run at less than 10% of its rated capacity.&nbsp;That is like a restaurant only opening its doors for just over a month each year&mdash;not a sustainable business.&nbsp;With such poor sales, capacity payments may have accounted for most of its revenue and, if it didn&rsquo;t clear the capacity auction and lost those guaranteed payments, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to stay open. It&rsquo;s not surprising then that just days after the 2022/23 Capacity Auction results were published, it was announced Cheswick would retire.</p>

<p>An analysis by PJM concluded that its <a href=""https://pjm.com/planning/services-requests/gen-deactivations.aspx"">retirement won&rsquo;t create any reliability issues</a>, but that raises a bigger question.&nbsp;Why did we pay around $20 million to keep a plant in service that barely generated any electricity and wasn&rsquo;t actually needed anyway?&nbsp;The simple answer is systematic over-procurement.</p>

<p>While PJM says <a href=""https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/blog/Wilson%20Overprocurement%20of%20Capacity%20in%20PJM.PDF"">reserve margins in the range of 16% of their forecasted peak load</a> are adequate, their actual reserve margins are often over 20%, that alone results in about 15GW of unneeded capacity being bought each year.&nbsp;When we look back at the actual peak load, their reserve margins have been running closer to 30%.&nbsp;In short, ratepayers are spending literally billions of dollars to buy far more capacity than we need&mdash;even in a worst case scenario.</p>

<p>In response to this illusionary &ldquo;demand&rdquo; for capacity, generators had an incentive to increase supply.&nbsp;Over-procurement supports overbuilding of fossil resources.&nbsp;Now, as clean and renewable energy <a href=""https://www.lazard.com/perspective/lcoe2020"">keeps getting cheaper</a>, fossil fuel owners and investors are faced with an increasingly competitive energy market and are desperate to keep these guaranteed payments coming in to pad the bottom line.&nbsp;Or, in the dry language of PJM&rsquo;s filing, the expanded MOPR &ldquo;foments greater revenue reliance by resources on the capacity market, rather than the energy and reserves markets, contrary to the original design of restructured wholesale electricity markets.&rdquo;&nbsp;In other words, the rule created a bubble of unneeded capacity. Like any market bubble lacking fundamental underlying support, this could suddenly collapse if fossil fuel interests don&rsquo;t defend it.</p>

<p>Ignoring the value of clean energy on public health and the environment is central to their plan.&nbsp;In this view, paying for clean generation is a &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; but being allowed to pollute for free isn&rsquo;t, even if the amount others are paying for the damage is massive.</p>

<p>Another fossil-fuel strategy has been to pretend only fossil fuel power is valuable as a capacity resource.&nbsp;While it&rsquo;s true that a solar facility isn&rsquo;t going to operate at night and will produce less electricity on cloudy days, we&rsquo;ve seen in Texas and during our own polar vortex that fossil fuel plants aren&rsquo;t necessarily available when we need them either.&nbsp;While having variable resources complicates the management of our power grid, this is a well-understood issue <a href=""https://www.pjm.com/planning/resource-adequacy-planning/effective-load-carrying-capability"">that we can account for.</a></p>

<p>The expanded MOPR took this all a step further and effectively pretended that much of the new clean generation wouldn&rsquo;t exist at all. For fossil fuel plants, that means all of those capacity dollars flow to their pockets and not to their competitors.&nbsp;Reforming the MOPR not only threatened them with more competition, it drew attention to the more fundamental issue of overprocuremt.&nbsp;If PJM fixes that problem, the ratepayers will benefit but uneconomical and unnecessary fossil fuel plants will lose their safety net.&nbsp;That has them, and their friends in the legislature, in a panic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For polluters and their friends, forcing higher bills on ratepayers is a small price to pay when profits are on the line.</p>

Climate Goals Remain Elusive and Will Require Bold Action,9/23/2021,"<p>It is fitting that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection on Wednesday released an updated version of its <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/citizens/climate/Pages/PA-Climate-Action-Plan.aspx?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444"">Climate Action Plan</a> (CAP), which provides insight into the progress being made on Gov. Tom Wolf&rsquo;s climate goals. This is <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/its-climate-week-again-but-the-calendar-is-running-out"">Climate Week</a>, after all, a time when activists across the world hold marches and rallies to bring attention to the most pressing issue of our time: the climate crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/08/06/pennsylvania-climate-change-greenhouse-gases-republican-legislature/"">fourth largest emitter</a> of greenhouse gas emissions in the nation, Pennsylvania has an obligation to do its part to combat the climate crisis. To that end, Pennsylvania is well on its way toward achieving a 2025 goal, laid out in Governor Wolf&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/executive-order-2019-01-commonwealth-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change-and-promoting-energy-conservation-and-sustainable-governance/"">Executive Order 2019-01</a>, to reduce emissions 26 percent below 2005 levels. But more&nbsp;significant action will be necessary to achieve a long-term goal of reducing emissions by 80 percent by 2050.</p>

<p>As difficult as the 2050 target may seem, waiting until mid-century to slash emissions will bring even greater hardship. The fifth iteration in a series of reports outlining the commonwealth&rsquo;s progress in addressing climate change, the CAP highlights how Pennsylvania&rsquo;s average temperature has already risen nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900. We&rsquo;re now on course for another 6 degrees of warming by mid-century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While progress has been made, it will be hard for Pennsylvania to meet its climate goals as long as the fracked gas and other fossil fuel industries continue receiving preferential treatment from our elected officials.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the General Assembly continued to throw good money after bad in offering <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-A-New-Coalition-for-a-Better-Future"">massive handouts to incentivize</a> the construction of more petrochemical facilities here. That&rsquo;s not to mention the more than 50 other ways our state and local governments <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">subsidize fracked gas and other fossil fuel industries</a> across the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We cannot expect to meet these bold emissions reductions goals while still relying on dirty energy for economic growth. Unfortunately, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s electric power sector <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=PA"">heavily relies on fracked gas</a>. Now, Pennsylvanians need to accept the hard truth that we must transition -&nbsp;as soon as possible -&nbsp;from&nbsp;fossil fuels, including fracked gas, as the way forward to achieve carbon neutrality. Bold action must be taken to avert the most disastrous consequences of the climate crisis. Continued support for the fracking industry undermines the governor&rsquo;s climate change ambitions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the power generation sector has to be an integral focus of emissions reductions, the Climate Action Plan highlighted a new sector that is set to overtake the electricity sector and soon become Pennsylvania&rsquo;s largest contributor of emissions: industry.</p>

<p>In 2005, the industrial sector released only half as many emissions as electricity generation. By 2030, industrial sources will be responsible for more emissions than all the state&rsquo;s power plants and agriculture &mdash; combined. This unfortunate trend is driven by a forecasted growth in petrochemical plants as well as continued pollution from steel plants, cement manufacturers, and other industrial producers. The CAP predicts industrial emissions to grow 14 percent by 2030.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Still, the governor&rsquo;s 2050 goals are not out of reach. Several of the clean energy policies recommended in the CAP are, in fact, well underway. Further policy changes could very reasonably put us on track to achieve the goal of reducing emissions by 80 percent.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Earlier this month, for instance, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-So-What-Comes-Next-for-Pennsylvania's-Efforts-to-Join-the-Regional-Greenhouse-Gas-Initiative"">voted to approve DEP&rsquo;s proposed CO2 Budget Trading Rule</a>. The development means Pennsylvania could become a participant in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), likely by early next year.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Joining RGGI would help to level the playing field for renewable energy producers. The CAP forecasts a modest growth of renewable energy production in the years ahead, leveling off at 10 percent. This sober estimate pales in comparison to the optimistic forecast produced this month by the U.S. Department of Energy. The <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-solar-futures-study-providing-blueprint-zero-carbon-grid"">Solar Future Study</a> laid out a vision for solar energy &mdash; all on its own &mdash; fulfilling 40 percent of the country&rsquo;s energy supplies.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The contrast is less about differences in report authors&rsquo; energy policy philosophies, and more of a reflection of how Pennsylvania&rsquo;s renewable energy incentives are increasingly antiquated. After all, the state&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.puc.pa.gov/filing-resources/issues-laws-regulations/aeps-act/"">Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard Act</a>&nbsp;was signed into law 17 years ago. Energy markets have since evolved, yet our energy policies remain relatively unchanged.</p>

<p>Finally, the transportation sector will also have to cut emissions significantly to reach the 2050 goal, accounting for 21 percent of targeted emission reductions.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s transit agencies and other public and private fleet operators are increasingly switching to battery-electric vehicles, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/16/battery-electric-freight-train-wabtec-rail-transport-emissions"">like Pittsburgh-based Wabtec</a>, which recently unveiled the world&rsquo;s first battery-electric freight train. Growing prevalence of charging infrastructure and declining costs of electric vehicles will likely accelerate the transition. Plus, greater electrification further underscores the importance of switching to a cleaner electric grid.</p>

<p>CAP is further evidence that ambitious climate action is not only necessary for protecting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment but also beneficial for our economy. DEP suggests that implementing the 18 clean-energy policy changes outlined in the report would generate an average of 42,000 new jobs every year.</p>

<p>Lawmakers should take notice. Further delay on serious climate action not only risks further exacerbating heat waves, flooding, and other climate-induced threats. By delaying the transition to a clean energy economy, our state leaders are choosing to protect the fracked gas industry and hold back Pennsylvania&rsquo;s full economic potential.&nbsp;</p>

Pennsylvania as a Hydrogen Hub,9/16/2021,"<p>It was recently announced that fossil fuel industry leader Perry Babb <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2021/08/15/A-laboratory-at-scale-a-hydrogen-carbon-storage-shale-drilling-and-urea-project-has-hit-the-industry-zeitgeist-at-just-the-right-time/stories/202108080048%E2%80%8B"">will launch a $410 million project</a> called KeyState to Zero in Clinton County, north-central Pennsylvania. This effort is part of a larger push by a mixture of government and private entities to pursue hydrogen as an alleged means to achieve net zero carbon emissions. Hydrogen, generally, is seen as an alternative to traditional fossil fuels <a href=""https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/hydrogen-101/"">for heavy industries that cannot be electrified</a> as easily, such as marine transportation, cement and steel production, and long-haul freight. Hydrogen by itself has no carbon and thus emits none when burned or reacted in fuel cells. However, Babb and others fail to make the explicit distinction between the different types of hydrogen power that exist. Not all hydrogen is created equal, and Babb&rsquo;s hydrogen plant merely keeps the fossil fuel industry alive while polluting just as much as, and in some cases more than, current dirty sources.</p>

<p>One form of hydrogen power which can be truly clean and net-zero is achieved through electrolysis. This form of hydrogen power, also known as &ldquo;green&rdquo; hydrogen, uses renewable energy to power the splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.&nbsp; However, PennFuture recognizes that <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/thebarkedition17"">even this form of hydrogen power</a> is still inefficient and costly in most cases, and we must invest resources, time, and research in other forms of sustainable energy such as solar and wind.</p>

<p>One of the other forms of hydrogen power involves the capturing and sequestering of carbon dioxide (CO2), commonly known as &ldquo;blue&rdquo; hydrogen. Blue hydrogen proponents see potential in Pennsylvania becoming a &ldquo;Blue Hydrogen Hub.&rdquo; This is due to the vast amounts of natural gas located in the state, as methane (a large component of natural gas) releases massive amounts of CO2 which can be captured and stored into producing blue hydrogen. Proponents also believe that legacy fossil fuel pipelines can be retrofitted to transport blue hydrogen, which itself can also be blended with traditional fossil fuels and used as energy. This effectively allows the fossil fuel industry an extended lifeline&mdash;where it can continue to extract and pollute, while capturing some CO2 and producing hydrogen power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Babb called blue hydrogen <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2021/08/15/A-laboratory-at-scale-a-hydrogen-carbon-storage-shale-drilling-and-urea-project-has-hit-the-industry-zeitgeist-at-just-the-right-time/stories/202108080048%E2%80%8B"">a stepping stone to green hydrogen</a> and net zero emissions, as it is too expensive to mass produce green hydrogen at this time. However, while hydrogen on its own produces no carbon emissions, the process required to create blue hydrogen itself is just as CO2-intensive as traditional methane-based natural gas production and even more potentially harmful to the environment. Hydrogen is a smaller molecule than natural gas and more easily leaks out of steel pipelines. It can also cause steel to become weak and brittle, and thus is easier to combust and can create a flame unseen by the human eye. And the truth remains that the more money and time spent on promoting blue hydrogen, the less focus there will be on developing cleaner, green hydrogen. Green hydrogen only comprises <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/green-hydrogen-is-gaining-traction-but-it-must-overcome-big-hurdles.html"">about .1 percent of all global hydrogen production</a>. It is clear that the fracked gas industry is not looking for a stepping stone, but for an endpoint with blue hydrogen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a nationwide lens, it was recently reported that President Biden&rsquo;s current bipartisan infrastructure legislation <a href=""https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/energy/567726-new-study-says-biden-approved-blue-hydrogen-may"">would allocate $8 billion of the total $1 trillion</a> to development and research on CO2 capture and storage-based energy, blue hydrogen. According to the Guardian, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/12/clean-fuel-blue-hydrogen-coal-study"">blue hydrogen creates 20 percent more greenhouse gases</a> than coal during its production. According to the Energy Science &amp; Engineering journal, <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ese3.956"">blue hydrogen is 60 percent more polluting</a> than burning diesel when being burned for heat.</p>

<p>There are green hydrogen projects underway that are at least worth examining further. One is by New York-based <a href=""https://www.ir.plugpower.com/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2021/Plug-Power-and-Brookfield-Renewable-Move-Forward-with-Green-Hydrogen-Plant-in-South-Central-Pennsylvania/default.aspx"">company Plug Power</a>, who is partnering with Holtwood Dam operator Brookfield Renewable Partners to build Pennsylvania&rsquo;s first green hydrogen plant in southern Lancaster County. The new plant will use power from the hydroelectric facility and water from the Susquehanna River to produce 15 metric tons of liquid hydrogen per day, which the company says is enough to power 1,500 heavy-duty trucks. The plant is expected to be online by the end of 2022 and create 25 permanent jobs. As stated earlier, however, state and federal funds allocated to hydrogen should be invested in researching and developing cheaper and sustainable methods to utilize green hydrogen in the future.</p>

<p>For those well aware of the need for our nation to get serious about mitigating climate change, Pennsylvania becoming a &ldquo;Blue Hydrogen Hub&rdquo; would simply be continuing us down the same ruinous path. It has long been the position of PennFuture that we, as both a Commonwealth and a nation, must work towards zero carbon emissions through economic, research, and development investments into alternative, green energy sources which would also produce good paying jobs for our citizens.&nbsp;</p>

"PennFuture, Partners Appeal Air Permit Extension for Proposed Liquefied Natural Gas Plant in Wyalusing Township",9/15/2021,"<p>The Department of Environmental Protection (&ldquo;DEP&rdquo;) recently issued a second extension of the air pollution permit for a proposed Bradford County Real Estate Partners (&ldquo;BCREP&rdquo;) Liquified Natural Gas (&ldquo;LNG&rdquo;) facility near the Susquehanna River in Wyalusing Township, Bradford County, in Northeastern Pennsylvania.&nbsp;PennFuture, and our partners Clean Air Council and Sierra Club, appealed this extension to the Environmental Hearing Board.</p>

<p>The facility would process fracked natural gas into LNG for shipment by truck or train to a proposed LNG export facility in Gibbstown, New Jersey for transport overseas.&nbsp;The Wyalusing facility would include a six-million-gallon LNG storage tank and truck loadout system.&nbsp;If completed, the Wyalusing facility would be permitted to emit over a million tons of greenhouse gases and hundreds of tons of other harmful air pollutants annually.&nbsp;An LNG facility like this one would not only contribute to climate change and threaten public health and the environment through its direct emissions, but it would also lead to increased fracking in Pennsylvania and further entrenchment of the fossil fuel industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We object to the permit extension on a number of grounds.&nbsp;DEP erred in granting the extension because BCREP has not commenced construction at the Wyalusing facility, as required by the regulations.&nbsp;Further, the second extension relies on an outdated and flawed &ldquo;Best Available Technology&rdquo; determination.&nbsp;The DEP also relied on flawed analysis resulting in insufficient and erroneous air emission limits.&nbsp;We also object to the permit extension on the basis of a number of other significant deficiencies, as detailed in our Notice of Appeal.&nbsp;For more information, our full Notice of Appeal <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2021-8-26-Notice-of-Appeal-without-exhibits.pdf"">may be read here.</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the Wyalusing facility is part of a logistically and financially connected LNG export scheme, which plans to truck or train highly explosive LNG through Pennsylvania communities, to be exported for overseas markets from the proposed facility in Gibbstown, NJ on the banks of the Delaware River.&nbsp;To learn more about LNG, its dangers, and the Wyalusing facility, please check out our LNG Blog Series: <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">LNG Blog #1</a>, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-2-Bomb-Trains-Through-Pennsylvania"">LNG Blog #2</a>, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-3-Protect-Northern-PA"">LNG Blog #3</a>, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-4-Liquified-Natural-Gas-Should-Not-Become-the-New-Bomb-Trains-to-Threaten-Our-Communities"">LNG Blog #4</a>, and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-5-Public-opposition-grows-to-proposed-LNG-shipping-terminals"">LNG Blog #5</a>.</p>

<p>PennFuture has been engaged with local community members and organizations in tracking and opposing this facility and the transport of LNG across the state.&nbsp;PennFuture and Sierra Club <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Intervenes-to-Support-FERC-Jurisdiction-over-Wyalusing-LNG-Facility"">have previously objected</a> to a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&ldquo;FERC&rdquo;) regarding FERC&rsquo;s jurisdiction over the proposed Wyalusing facility, thereby removing requirements to analyze the environmental impacts of the proposed scheme, including cumulative impacts under the National Environmental Policy Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our appeal of this extension is another step in our efforts to ensure full oversight of the Wyalusing facility and the LNG industry in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;This LNG terminal is nothing more than one more dangerous speculation by a company trying to find new outlets for dirty fracked gas.&nbsp;And once again, our communities will suffer the harmful impacts of this scheme without any benefit of the end product.&nbsp;PennFuture stands committed to opposing new fracked gas facilities, instead supporting a true, sustainable clean energy future for Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture works hard to protect our waters, our air, and our communities from the dangers of the petrochemical buildout across Pennsylvania.&nbsp;By challenging DEP&rsquo;s extension of the Wyalusing facility&rsquo;s air pollution permit, PennFuture continues that work and our fight for a clean energy future.&nbsp;If you are interested in supporting our fight, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/donate"">please become a member today!&nbsp;</a></p>

So What Comes Next for Pennsylvania's Efforts to Join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative?,9/14/2021,"<p>On September 1st, 2021, a majority of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) voted to approve the proposed CO2 Budget Trading Rule under which Pennsylvania will participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). IRRC not only found that finalizing the rule is in the public interest, they also concluded that the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) acted within its statutory authority and intent of the General Assembly when it approved the rule.</p>

<p>IRRC didn&rsquo;t take this step lightly. The board&nbsp;not only reviewed the text of the rule itself, but a massive 871-page packet that, in addition to the regulatory text at DEP&rsquo;s analysis of the regulation, included the DEP&rsquo;s responses to the 14,038 written comments they received and issues raised during 32 hours of testimony provided by 449 people during a series of public hearings this past December.&nbsp;In addition to that, IRRC received 280 comment submissions directly from the public along with 68 submissions from members of the legislature.&nbsp;Finally, IRRC took several hours of in-person testimony on the day of the hearing itself.</p>

<p>While this was a resounding vindication for the program, polluters and their friends in the legislature haven&rsquo;t given up their fight, and further delaying tactics are expected.</p>

<p>Shortly after IRRC&rsquo;s approval, the House Environmental Resources and Energy (ERE) Committee&mdash;led by the <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2021/08/05/Cleaner-air-must-be-the-goal-carbon-cap-and-trade-is-the-way-forward/stories/202107200018"">bombastic climate change denier Daryl Metcalfe</a>&mdash;quickly met to vote out a &ldquo;joint resolution of disapproval&rdquo; to kill the program.&nbsp;While there are enough anti-environmental votes in the House and Senate to pass such a resolution, it&rsquo;s unlikely that there are enough votes to override Governor Wolf&rsquo;s veto.</p>

<p>If this sounds familiar, it is.&nbsp;Last session the House and Senate passed HB 2025 which would have required any program to cut carbon pollution be submitted to the legislature for their approval.&nbsp; Governor Wolf quickly vetoed this bill and it didn&rsquo;t go any further&mdash;a good sign that the votes to override the veto just weren&rsquo;t there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>After already failing once, the Senate tried again this spring with a new version of the bill under the number SB 119.&nbsp;While this easily passed the Senate, it&rsquo;s been sitting in&nbsp;Metcalf&rsquo;s ERE committee without action since then. There is little doubt that this new bill would pass the House if it ever comes up for a vote, but that isn&rsquo;t good enough.&nbsp;Failing to pass with a veto-proof majority would be yet another loss for Metcalfe&nbsp;and his cronies.</p>

<p>While they may not be able to stop the rule, they can cause delays.&nbsp;With the resolution of disapproval voted out of committee, the House and Senate each have 30 calendar days or 10 session days (whichever is longer) to pass the resolution&mdash;which would stop the rule from going forward until at least mid-October.&nbsp;After the Governor vetoes the resolution, the House and Senate would get another 30 calendar days or 10 session days to override that veto.&nbsp;Depending on the precise timing, it could be December or January before that hurdle is cleared.</p>

<p>Once the clock expires without a veto override, the process isn&rsquo;t quite over yet.&nbsp;The Attorney General must review all regulatory packages for legality and form.&nbsp;This step isn&rsquo;t expected to be a problem, but a thorough review will take some additional time. And, once that is done, the package will go to the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) to arrange for it to be printed in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and officially go into effect. It typically takes several more weeks for the LRB to complete this process.</p>

<p>Actual implementation of the rule may be unlikely before the end of the year, but DEP foresaw that possibility. If not in effect by January 1, the rule will start at the beginning of the next calendar quarter following finalization.</p>

<p>Of course, those extra weeks of delay give polluters that much more time to dump their waste into our air for free.&nbsp;That may explain a lot about why their friends in the Legislature are fighting so hard.</p>

Climate Denial and Pennsylvania Politics: The Ultimate Alternative Universe,9/9/2021,"<p>Last week, on September 1, 2021, individuals on &ldquo;both sides&rdquo; of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) traveled to and from Harrisburg and through Hurricane Ida for an important meeting, that of the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, also known as IRRC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On this day, IRRC was voting whether to advance a regulation that would have Pennsylvania join RGGI, so that the Commonwealth can pursue its climate pollution reduction goals.&nbsp;Be they on the pro-RGGI side of the 23-month long debate, or the anti-RGGI side, to a person, the witnesses mentioned their rough car ride and passages through the deluge that the tropical storm was dumping across our state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of an organization whose mission it is to hasten the state&rsquo;s transition to clean energy, and for which Pennsylvania joining RGGI has been our top priority for reducing greenhouse gases here in the state, the journey to make it to this day had been rocky, but well-worth it because the commission ultimately voted in favor of Pennsylvania linking with RGGI, a big deal to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>That day, many local and industry folks testified against RGGI, and that was to be expected.&nbsp;There were statements that perpetuated mistruths spread by industry about the program and the Governor&rsquo;s authority, which we dismiss without a second thought.&nbsp;There was angry testimony from folks who rejected everything about the program and its possibilities, who were never going to give RGGI a chance from the start.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And there was testimony that, for someone like me growing up in the anthracite coal mining region of northeastern Pennsylvania, experiencing the death of that industry and now living in the same region still struggling through economic and social upheaval decades after coal&rsquo;s demise&hellip;well, these testimonies hit a little closer to home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Closer to home in that the world will be changing for communities still dependent on coal jobs as most energy produced by coal goes away.&nbsp;But this time around, RGGI will be providing a glidepath with funding to underwrite any number of investments that can make a difficult transition less hard.&nbsp;For communities that take advantage of this opportunity, the future can hold promise, and not be defined by a bitter political fight where regular folks are exploited by industry players who will eventually abandon them, and their children, to an inevitable end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the day went on, and people made their way home from the Harrisburg hearing, climate-supercharged storm Ida turned its horror on Pennsylvania and the Northeast, killing dozens of people and laughing in the face of our man-made environment.&nbsp;Homes, businesses, transmission lines, drainage and transportation systems that have been able to endure for generations, failing. Our infrastructure cannot withstand climate impacts, and our earth&rsquo;s protective natural systems have deteriorated and are collapsing into floods, fire, and worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the face of a changed climate, where impacts are being felt in every part of our world, country and state, we have empathy for coal workers and their families.&nbsp;However, with climate action - the issue by which this era will be defined - and inaction of so many of our elected officials, we are holding accountable the anti-environmental politicians, the fossil fuel industry, and their lobby and public relations firms who in the face of an unleashed climate emergency:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Put profit, pipelines, petrochemicals and plastics before Pennsylvanians;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Embrace climate denial and dismiss climate reality;</li>
	<li>Abuse the power bestowed on them by the electorate who expect representation of the greater good, and instead represent special interests in breach;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Remain laser focused on&nbsp; policies and subsidies that serve coal, fracked gas and hydrogen, while neighboring states invest in climate saving renewable energy and efficiency;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>and champion corporate entitlement before environmental rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what defines the majority of our state legislature in the alternate universe of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;We need climate leadership here.&nbsp;We need to urgently decarbonize.&nbsp;Yes, there are abundant fossil fuels here, but it&rsquo;s time to&nbsp; leave them in the ground. We need to help our workers, and re-focus our unions. And we need voters to end this lunacy.</p>

Philadelphia Has an Urban Planning Problem,8/25/2021,"<p>Philadelphia has an urban planning problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the wake of <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-IPCC-Sounds-Code-Red-Alarm-on-Climate-Crisis"">the clarion call to action</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we can no longer delay in securing a city that is clean, green, and carbon neutral. Philadelphia public officials and residents must recognize that the insatiable hunger for more pavement and impervious surface will only further exacerbate the impact of climate change that is already being felt in neighborhoods across the city.</p>

<p>I was recently afforded the opportunity to publish <a href=""https://twitter.com/amnagel1/status/1427277271132409861/photo/1"">a letter in The Philadelphia Inquirer</a> on the importance of prioritizing green space and green infrastructure in civic space related <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/real-estate/inga-saffron/south-street-district-headhouse-plaza-design-philadelphia-20210811.html"">to Inga Saffron&rsquo;s column</a> on the new Headhouse Plaza. Many have written about the obvious flaws in the design and construction of the new plaza. The space does not provide any protection from the sun or rain. It is visually unappealing and offers no physical comfort to anyone who may need it. Headhouse Plaza lacks basic amenities and offers little in the way of the forward-thinking approach necessary to urban planning as we continue to deal with a changing climate. What it lacks in vision, it is clear that the space is exactly what some neighbors lobbied for throughout the design process.</p>

<p>The architect on the project <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/kywnewsradio/news/local/new-headhouse-plaza-brings-diverging-opinions"">said this</a>: &ldquo;It started out with some more greenery, but that was sort of scaled back because of some of the near neighbors. They had concerns about greenery. <em>People didn&rsquo;t want a place where all the dogs were going to go.&rdquo;</em> (emphasis added)</p>

<p>One neighbor neatly summed up the major issue: &ldquo;We love it, it&rsquo;s a great improvement. The parking is nice. <em>We were afraid they were going to take away the parking.&rdquo;</em> (emphasis added)</p>

<p>Previously, the square contained 40 parking spaces. The new design cut the number of spaces to 30. Reducing parking was a hot topic of conversation throughout the design and construction of the new plaza. When the Art Commission <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/art-commission-approves-public-space-expansion-at-headhouse-square/"">ultimately approved the design</a>, commissioners &ldquo;&hellip;wondered if such an act would provoke controversy, as parking is the third rail of both Philadelphia city politics and urban design.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philadelphia made significant strides <a href=""http://www.amlegal.com/pdffiles/Philadelphia/120431.pdf"">to reduce parking minimums in 2012</a>. Despite this and the efforts of other cities across the country to eliminate parking minimums entirely, we have seen attempts to reverse the progress made in Philadelphia <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/proposal-to-increase-parking-minimums-finds-no-support-from-planning-commission/"">time</a> and <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/city-council-moves-to-require-more-parking-in-philly-neighborhoods/"">time</a> again. Most recently, the Philadelphia City Planning Commission <a href=""https://www.phila2035.org/germantownnorth?fbclid=IwAR3GMLhQLwS6KioeuljtZ9lWL0N4KvVVsNNzwub65QLoHrKr2xf6jJAtiUM"">announced efforts to update zoning rules</a> in northern Germantown that would effectively mandate increased parking minimums in that area by requiring that new buildings with ten or more apartments or condos have a parking lot or garage. The city has framed this effort as part of its Philadelphia2035 comprehensive plan to manage growth and development in Philadelphia, but significantly increasing pavement and impervious surface does nothing to address the climate emergency we face in 2021 let alone the increasing heat and precipitation we must be prepared for in 2035.</p>

<p>More pavement and impervious surface will only make Philadelphia more vulnerable to warmer, wetter weather. There is <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/racism-left-hunting-park-overheated-neighbors-are-making-a-cooler-future/"">growing evidence and understanding</a> that urban spaces <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/a-coloring-book-to-inspire-solutions-for-cooling-phillys-hotter-neighborhoods/"">consistently suffer from more extreme temperatures</a> due to an absence of green space. We also know that <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/philadelphia-trees-canopy-urban-heat-island-race-20210811.html"">racist practices like redlining</a> have disproportionately impacted communities of color as they grapple with hotter temperatures than predominantly white neighborhoods. Impervious surface also directly leads to increased polluted runoff in our water and increased flooding in our streets due to <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Its-Time-to-Reimagine-Americas-Infrastructure"">aging infrastructure that cannot properly handle a 21st century climate.</a></p>

<p>There is such a strong temptation to continue feeding the need for parking because of the powerful forces behind the parking industry and the vocal community members who do not want green space because it attracts too many dogs. Philadelphia may have been a parking diet since 2012, but it is time to quit the feeding frenzy for good. We must <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/real-estate/parking-laws-spaces-philadelphia-20210706.html"">rethink community spaces</a> and engage in processes that inform and educate about the imminent danger of climate change and the need to build more nature into our built world.</p>

<p>There are neighborhoods across Philadelphia that are suffering from urban heat island effect, and some people live in constant fear that their homes will flood every time it rains. Investments in green space and green infrastructure will help neighborhoods combat these dual threats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eastwick is one area <a href=""https://www.phillytrib.com/news/local_news/how-can-i-pay-for-this-eastwick-residents-struggle-to-fix-isaias-damage-without-federal/article_d1e4a326-9094-5bb9-b137-532e7ff7b608.html"">that needs help now to protect itself</a> from increased flooding and build a neighborhood that is more resilient to the effects of climate change. Neighbors are actively engaged and have been fighting for decades for investment in their community to address <a href=""https://nextcity.org/features/view/philadelphia-eastwick-neighborhood-urban-renewal-failure"">a legacy of broken promises and deliberate disinvestment.</a> Urban planning and development could serve as a model for the entire city with the proper approach and understanding of climate challenges to come.</p>

<p>Luckily, <a href=""https://issuu.com/interfacestudio/docs/lepls_final_031319"">there is already a plan</a> that broadly outlines what could be possible on city-owned land in Eastwick. While Philadelphia City Councilmember Kenyatta Johnson has taken the prudent approach to halt city development in the area, the Lower Eastwick Public Land Strategy does contain promising suggestions for additional green space and green infrastructure that should be the primary focus of any development in Eastwick.</p>

<p>PennFuture <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/councilmember-calls-for-500-million-for-to-resolve-eastwick-flooding/"">strongly supports Councilmember Johnson&rsquo;s call</a> for $500 million in federal infrastructure funding to be allocated to Philadelphia for flood mitigation efforts in Eastwick. This funding would help clear the way for natural solutions to the area&rsquo;s climate problems. Though there are certain aspects of the Lower Eastwick Public Land Strategy that <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/philadelphia-refinery-hilco-redevelopment-plan-soil-contamination-20200723.html"">should be discarded</a> due to other development projects in the area and their negative impact on climate readiness, the strategy points to multiple parcels that will provide open space, preserve existing wetlands, and implement green infrastructure to combat flooding.</p>

<p>Humanity has directly confronted nature with a built world for the past century &ndash; often at the expense of its most vulnerable communities. Now, we are faced with natural problems that will not be solved by <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/u-s-army-corps-and-city-water-department-say-study-on-eastwick-flooding-solutions-should-be-complete-in-october/"">levees</a>, <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/what-it-would-take-build-earthen-berm-flood-control-section-cobbs-creek-eastwick/"">earthen berms</a>, or more pavement. In the face of <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/tropical-storm-fred-urban-heat-island-tornado-flood-20210822.html"">growing evidence that our built world</a> is exacerbating the heat and flooding that we experience, it is time to set aside the strategies of the 19th century and adopt natural solutions for the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This critical work will require a concerted effort from all levels of city government. It will require public officials to engage with residents, educate their constituents on the climate challenges we face, and be willing to ignore concerns about reduced parking and dogs that like trees and grass. Philadelphia <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/19/early-1990s-heat-waves-battered-philadelphias-most-vulnerable-communities-lessons-learned-are-helping-today/?tid=ss_tw"">remains a leader in helping residents</a> deal with climate change. It is time to build on that foundation and lead the charge for green space and green infrastructure in urban planning and development.</p>

Civilian Conservation Corps: Then and Now,8/23/2021,"<p>Earlier this month, Promised Land State Park celebrated its annual Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Day in which the public was invited to the Masker Museum filled with live music, cake, CCC artifacts, and an honorary guest speaker, Cornelius McHugh, a former CCC worker who had just recently turned 100.</p>

<p>We learned that the Civilian Conservation Corps played a critical role healing our environment and putting Americans back to work. It was established in 1933 amidst the Dust Bowl wherein forests had been clear cut and burned, resulting in erosion and sedimentation of local streams and waterways as well as the Great Depression, in which 13 million people were suddenly unemployed due to an unregulated stock market crash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This unique federal program established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt put 3 million single men between the ages of 18-25 to work, remedying the damage done by the poor land practices of the earlier centuries. While enrolled, some learned to read, many obtained their high school diploma and all learned a trade. Purposeful work restored a sense of values, taught essential skills and developed a work ethic among these recruits.The CCC boys fought fires, planted trees, built trails, campgrounds and roads, and helped create the beautiful Promised Land State Park in the Poconos area that so many visit today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CCC provided opportunities during a time without any social programs in place. Cornelius had mentioned he started his work for the CCC just five days after graduating high school. He had earned $30 a month, in which he had sent $25 back home to his family and kept $5 for himself--which he stated was efficient, especially because there were no other opportunities. In addition, the $5 he spent on cigarettes, candy, beer, and dates with local girls helped contribute to the local economy.</p>

<p>Many of the CCC boys went on to fight in WWII, and when they returned, they came home to a country that was prosperous and had conserved its natural treasures and a nationwide system of parks accessible to everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Civilian Conservation Corps had been a proven success, building 800 state parks in eight years, while keeping local businesses going and families fed. The success of the CCC in rebuilding our nation has taught us that we do not turn our backs on our fellow Americans in need and that we conserve our lands and waters for future generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s time to bring it back, but with a modernized spin to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As communities in Pennsylvania and across the country continue to face devastating economic conditions as well as the effects of the climate crisis, a revitalized Civilian Conservation Corps would enable us to invest in our workforce, our environment, and the next generation of conservationists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Senator Bob Casey proposed a new bill, S.B. 2414, for a revitalized CCC that will create federal conservation jobs, support agricultural conservation and ensure we are prioritizing environmental justice communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This bill comes after months of close collaboration with regional advocates like PennFuture and the ReImagine Appalachia coalition, to ensure that this legislation will help communities most impacted by the combined impacts of the downturn of the fossil fuel industry, the pandemic, and an ongoing opioid epidemic that has devastated families.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This CCC proposal prioritizes Black and Indigenous people, working people with low incomes, rural workers and returning citizens. Seventy million Americans&mdash;one in three adults&mdash;have a criminal record. By prioritizing these marginalized groups, a revitalized CCC could reverse the consequences of mass incarceration, by lifting barriers to the formerly incarcerated, those battling with opioid addiction, and their families.</p>

<p>Not only does this CCC proposal have a strong restorative justice component, but it will assist with carbon absorption by restoring wetlands, planting millions of diverse, native plants and trees, and removing invasive trees and shrubs. A new CCC can help farmers implement regenerative practices to restore the land by the new extractive industry practices over the last decades, potentially absorbing over 20% of all carbon emissions from the Appalachian region alone.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://reimagineappalachia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ReImagine-Appalachia_PeriBrief_PA_Jan2021.pdf"">a recent study from the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI)</a> and ReImagine Appalachia, relaunching the CCC could create 57,000 jobs in Pennsylvania. How could we pass that up?</p>

<p>This modernized Civilian Conservation Corps combines sound environmental policy with family-sustaining jobs and training. Similar to the lesson learned from the original CCC, we do not turn our backs on fellow Americans in need and must work to conserve our lands and water for future generations to come.&nbsp;</p>

IPCC Sounds ‘Code Red’ Alarm on Climate Crisis,8/13/2021,"<p>The days of climate change uncertainty are behind us. In the latest set of reports from the world&rsquo;s leading climate researchers, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/"">announced that the scientific evidence</a> of human influence on widespread and rapid warming is now &ldquo;unequivocal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>All that remains uncertain is how much of the damage is irreversible, and whether we can muster the collective political courage to slow climate change before it&rsquo;s too late. Failure to reduce emissions will create, in the words of one climate researcher, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/10/code-red-for-humanity-what-the-papers-say-about-the-ipcc-report-on-the-climate-crisis"">&ldquo;hell on earth.&rdquo;</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Climate policies such as <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fallacy-Fiction-and-Falsehoods-Debunking-RGGI-Myths-Part-1"">the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a> are crucially important because we still have a window of opportunity to slow the pace of warming. Failure to reduce emissions in the next few years will force upon future generations an environment that is very&nbsp;hot, wet and dangerous, barely resembling the world as we know it today.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Physical Science Basis&rdquo; is the first release in a series of landmark summary findings to be rolled out in the next year. To develop the international body&rsquo;s Sixth Assessment Report, hundreds of climate researchers reviewed all the relevant scientific literature published since 2013.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The IPCC assessment reached the following conclusions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Humans are responsible for warming global surface temperatures by an estimated average of 1.07 degrees Celsius (1.9 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Global climate change is due to a buildup of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, now reaching annual averages of 410 parts per million (ppm) for carbon dioxide (CO2), 1,866 parts per billion (ppb) for methane (CH4), and 332 ppb for nitrous oxide (N2O).</li>
	<li>Concentrations of atmospheric pollution have reached historic highs. CO2 levels are higher than at any time in at least 2 million years, while methane and N2O are higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>As a result, each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it, dating back to temperatures recorded in 1850.</li>
	<li>Climate change is very likely compounding our risks of extreme events such as heatwaves, droughts, fire, and heavy floods, as well as intensifying global trends of sea level rise, ocean acidification, and glacial retreat.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the severity of climate change will be experienced unevenly around the world, no region will be totally unaffected. In the eastern half of North America, the assessment <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Updated-Climate-Change-Assessment-Reveals-Future-Pennsylvania-Water-Troubles"">concludes that significant increases in heavy precipitation</a> and flooding are both very likely, especially if current levels of emissions continue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Essentially, the clock is ticking. We can release less than 500 additional gigatons of carbon dioxide &mdash; roughly equal to 10 years of current global emissions &mdash; if we want a decent chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). So far, we&rsquo;re on pace to pass the 1.5-degree mark by the early 2030s.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In Pennsylvania, joining RGGI would cost-effectively mandate limits on carbon emissions by allowing electricity generation producers to cooperate with counterparts across the Northeast. To put RGGI into motion, the CO2 Budget Trading Program has been proposed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). But the program is still awaiting Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) approval, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-What-Comes-Next-in-Pennsylvanias-Efforts-to-Join-RGG"">the current step in a 19-month (and counting) regulatory process.</a></p>

<p>While progress on joining RGGI is a welcomed development, the latest IPCC report makes clear that delay comes with serious consequences. Regulatory hurdles help polluting industries continue to profit while devastating climate change awaits.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the federal level, <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684"">the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to combat climate change. The current version of the recently passed Senate bill would, if passed by the House of Representatives, upgrade our power infrastructure to better accommodate renewable energy, develop a national network of electric vehicle chargers, and support school districts with buying electric buses and building out the necessary charging infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Still, more is needed. The FY 2022 <a href=""https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/MEMORANDUM%20for%20Democratic%20Senators%20-%20FY2022%20Budget%20Resolution.pdf"">Budget Resolution Agreement</a> being discussed in Congress has included proposals for a Clean Electricity Payment Program. If passed through reconciliation, the legislation would incentivize electric utilities to transition to 80-percent clean energy by 2030.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This kind of bold leadership is needed at every level of government and throughout the private sector. By now, each and every municipality, school district, business, and property owner in Pennsylvania needs to wake up to the realities of our climate crisis. Rather than wait and deal with the consequences, it is time to embrace readily available energy efficiency, clean electricity and low-carbon transportation options.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Transitioning to a clean energy future is necessary if we want to avert the worst outcomes of a warming climate. We simply do not have time to waste.</p>

Chasing Bitcoin is a Bad Investment for Pennsylvania,8/12/2021,"<p>On August 9th, 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#SPM"">released its Sixth Assessment report</a>, clearly linking human-caused climate change to the extreme heatwaves and severe weather events we see all around the world.&nbsp;While it&rsquo;s not too late to avoid the most severe effects, the situation is projected to get even worse without immediate action to cut carbon pollution.</p>

<p>Against that backdrop, it is shocking that our state government is continuing to force Pennsylvanians to not only suffer the consequences of climate change but to pay polluters massive subsidies that will result in even more emissions. Invariably these unsustainable businesses are boom-and-bust.&nbsp;They take the higher profits while they can, before leaving PA taxpayers to pay to clean up their mess.</p>

<p>PennFuture has written extensively on how this subsidy-then-bust process is propping up fracking and petrochemical businesses in Pennsylvania. This pattern can also be found in the incredibly dirty waste coal industry, but now with an unlikely partner&mdash;Bitcoin. One recent example is Stronghold Digital Mining&mdash;a new firm that repurposes dirty waste-coal burning power plants to mine the cryptocurrency known as bitcoin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In late July 2021, <a href=""https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-038087/#BUSINESS"">Stronghold filed a form S-1</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing information about the business and its finances.&nbsp;They report that they currently own and operate the Scrubgrass waste coal plant in Venango County, have a definitive agreement for the Panther Creek plant in Carbon County, and a letter of intent to purchase a third plant&mdash;all for the purpose of bitcoin mining.&nbsp; Unlike the fracking and petrochemical industry, Stronghold is at least open about the fact that their business model requires significant taxpayer subsidies for it to be viable.</p>

<p><u>Bitcoin is an energy intensive process and a growing carbon polluter</u></p>

<p>The Bitcoin Network as a whole consumes a tremendous amount of energy to run millions of special-purpose computers&mdash;known as application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs&mdash;that attempt to &ldquo;mine&rdquo; new blocks in the bitcoin blockchain. To create a new block these computers race to find a special number that, combined with the financial transactions and other data recorded in the block, gives a result that meets specific criteria.&nbsp;This is a trial-and-error process that is akin to picking the winning lottery number, but much more difficult, often taking trillions of attempts to find a working number.&nbsp;At the time of this writing, finding the special number might earn the winning miner nearly $300,000 worth of bitcoins. But, if someone else finds the number first, losing&nbsp;miners get nothing and must start the process from scratch.&nbsp;To be competitive, miners build vast data centers containing potentially thousands of ASIC miners, each testing many trillion of these hashes every second.</p>

<p>According to data from the <a href=""https://cbeci.org/"">Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index</a>, the network currently takes over 9 gigawatts (GW) of power to operate and could be as high as 35GW.&nbsp; Even at the low end of that range, that is enough electricity for over seven million houses.&nbsp; Stronghold, for its part, reports that they currently operate 1,840 miners that can cumulatively test around 85 thousand-trillion hashes per second (85 PH/S) and draw about 4.1 Megawatts (MW) of power&mdash;enough to supply over 3,000 average houses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bottom line: it takes an obscene amount of energy to mine bitcoin and now companies are looking to power that mining by buying up cheap, dirty, outdated power plants just to run the computers to do the mining. In the case of Stronghold, this power is coming from the Scrubgrass waste-coal power plant and, based on their 2019 emissions data, the existing mining is likely resulting in over 6 tons of CO2 being emitted every hour.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s more than 6,700 vehicle-miles worth of pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is bad enough, but Stronghold reports it has a definitive agreement to buy the Panther Creek waste-coal plant and has signed a letter of intent to purchase a third plant.&nbsp;In all, they are forecasting acquiring 57,000 miners by the end of 2022 and consuming 193 MW of electricity.&nbsp;The exact pollution rate depends on how these miners are split among the three plants, but it may be in the range of 278 tons per hour of CO2.&nbsp;Also, because this is new demand on the grid, other generators may end up increasing their output&mdash;and their pollution&mdash;to meet the demand that these plants will no longer serve.&nbsp;That could easily add another 25 tons of CO2 per hour&mdash;more than 30,000 vehicle-miles worth of emissions&mdash;and possibly much higher .</p>

<p><u>Stronghold Digital Mining&rsquo;s business model is an environmental nightmare</u></p>

<p>Stronghold is selling its business model to investors as environmental progress&mdash;it&rsquo;s purchasing waste coal plants to power its cryptocurrency mining while removing culm piles that scar Pennsylvania&rsquo;s landscapes and communities. Unfortunately, this is a classic case of greenwashing.</p>

<p>Coal-fired power plants are all notoriously dirty, but waste coal facilities are even worse.&nbsp;In addition to CO2, the Scrubgrass plant&rsquo;s most recent emissions report shows hundreds of tons of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrochloric acid, carbon monoxide, and more than a dozen other air pollutants including neurotoxins, carcinogens, and smog-forming compounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the Trump administration <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Trump-Administration-Rolls-Back-Air-Protections-from-Fossil-Fuel-Plants"">rolled back critical air quality protections for waste-coal plants</a> (although PennFuture and others have challenged this).&nbsp;While Stronghold claims that their operation is &ldquo;environmentally beneficial&rdquo; because it burns waste coal from piles that are currently polluting the land, they barely mention the very real public health and financial damages caused by increased air pollution and don&rsquo;t consider any alternatives to digging them up and burning them.&nbsp;Even if one believes that some waste piles are so dangerous that the damage and pollution from burning them could be justified, there is no guarantee these are the ones that will be used.</p>

<p>Waste coal is always dirty, but the bitcoin industry has an additional waste stream we should be concerned about&mdash;tons of electronics waste from thousands of obsolete ASICs.&nbsp;Because of the competitive nature of Bitcoin mining, the hardware has a very limited useful life&mdash;in some cases as short as 18 months&mdash;before new hardware renders it obsolete. We see this in Stronghold&rsquo;s own filing with many of their miners requiring 1,300 watts to calculate 13 trillion hashes per second (TH/s) where newer devices work three times as fast for the same power.&nbsp;As highly optimized &ldquo;application specific&rdquo; devices, there is little chance that any obsolete devices will be reused.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Pennsylvanians are, once again, being forced to subsidize pollution without any say</u></p>

<p>Another obvious problem with burning waste coal is the expense.&nbsp;The reason why coal plants are closing across the country is because they can&rsquo;t compete with cheaper gas-fired power plants and even cheaper clean renewable energy.&nbsp;A recent study on <a href=""https://www.lazard.com/perspective/lcoe2020"">the levelized cost of energy</a> (LCOE) shows coal costing more than $65 per megawatt-hour (MWh).&nbsp;Gas might be as low as $44/MWh and renewable energy can be as low as $26/MWh.&nbsp;Compared to a traditional coal plant like Homer City&mdash;which itself has faced bankruptcy&mdash;Scrubgrass needs to burn more than three times as much fuel for the same generation.&nbsp;Even with low-quality fuel that costs roughly half as much, it&rsquo;s clear that waste coal is never going to be the cheapest source of energy.</p>

<p>Stronghold claims that fuel costs, operational and maintenance costs, and administrative expenses to operate Scrubgrass will result in power costing $43/MWh.&nbsp;That seems very optimistic since the company reported $17,629,051 in total 2019 operating expenses in the S-1 filing and 239,191 MWh of generation reported to the Energy Information Administration.&nbsp;That&nbsp;suggests actual costs over $73/MWh. The S-1 lists income from energy sales for the period of just over $29/MWh, which is slightly higher than the PJM grid average of $25/MWh, but it also shows a $6 million operating loss on $7 million in energy sales, so real costs operating the facilities are likely much higher than their sales suggest.</p>

<p>Even if the company can bring the operating costs down to 43/MWh, it&rsquo;s still a big leap to go to the $18/MWh Stronghold claims they expect to pay for power going forward.&nbsp;To get to that number requires significant state subsidies.</p>

<p><em>Subsidy #1:&nbsp; PJM Capacity Over-procurement</em></p>

<p>First, Stronghold expects to receive $6/MWh from the PJM capacity market.&nbsp;This is a separate payment, in addition to the purchase of energy, that our electric grid operator makes to ensure sufficient generation capacity will be available in the future. Companies get these payments if they bid low enough to clear the capacity auction and are available to be dispatched in the delivery year.&nbsp;Over-procurement of capacity has historically acted as a subsidy for fossil fuels, but for 2022/23 <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/tom-rutigliano/how-save-four-billion-without-really-trying"">PJM procured much less capacity</a> resulting in a market clearing price of&nbsp; $50/MW-day, or about $1.7 million dollars a year for a plant like Scrubgrass.&nbsp;With payments that low, the only way they will receive $6.00/MWh is if the facility only ran at 35% capacity.&nbsp;There would be no reason to purchase two additional waste coal plants if Scrubgrass had that much spare capacity, so the company must be counting on capacity prices in the future well over $100/MW-day.&nbsp;That may have been common in the past, but there is no guarantee payments will return to that level. If true though, this implies billions of dollars in additional payments will come from the pockets of ratepayers.</p>

<p><em>Subsidy #2:&nbsp; Tier II Alternative Energy Credits</em></p>

<p>While most states have &ldquo;Renewable&rdquo; portfolio standards, Pennsylvania has an Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) program that subsidizes polluting resources like waste coal under what is called Tier II.&nbsp;In 2019, Tier II credits were not particularly valuable averaging only $0.31/MWh of generation statewide. Scrubgrass did better than average reporting $105,532 from this source or $0.41/MWh, but going forward, their prospectus estimates a huge jump to&nbsp; $15/MWh for these credits.</p>

<p>In 2020, our legislature changed the rules to the AEPS program restricting where Tier II credits could be generated.&nbsp;Instead of coming from a qualifying facility anywhere in the PJM grid&mdash;an area covering all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia, those credits will largely need to be generated within Pennsylvania.&nbsp;Prices are expected to spike as a result and, in fact, 2020 credits already shot up to $1.92 before this change was finalized costing ratepayers over $21 million.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have a clear indication how high these prices will actually go, but this doesn&rsquo;t appear to have been a significant concern for the Legislature, and it certainly didn&rsquo;t stop them. If prices actually go up to $15 per credit, it would cost Pennsylvania ratepayers an additional $168 million. That is not only far more that we pay for cleaner wind and solar credits, it is more than the entire AEPS program cost in 2020.</p>

<p><em>Subsidy #3:&nbsp; Coal Refuse Reclamation tax credit</em></p>

<p>The next handout Pennsylvanian&rsquo;s are providing these plants comes in the form of the Coal Refuse Reclamation (CRR) tax credit.&nbsp;This is a transferable credit of $4 for each ton of waste coal these facilities burn. Perversely, this means a plant&nbsp; burning dirtier and lower quality fuel gets a bigger handout per megawatt hour. While the original tax credit was capped at $10 million, our legislature again dug into the pockets of ratepayers in late 2020 doubling the cap to $20 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While currently the $4/MWh Stronghold expects to receive from this subsidy is reasonable for a facility like Scrubgrass, the $20 million cap may already be fully utilized.&nbsp;That means that if the company expands to three facilities and runs at higher capacity like they claim, there will be proportionally fewer credits available per megawatt hour in the future.&nbsp;That makes their claims in the prospectus suspect, but there has already been talk in our legislature about raising the cap on this handout yet again&mdash;that would mean higher profits for these polluters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Subsidy #4:&nbsp; RGGI Allowance Set-asides</em></p>

<p>At the same time we are giving significant handouts to buy more pollution, Governor Wolf has directed the Department of Environmental protection to move forward with programs to begin to address the climate crisis.&nbsp;One of these is the CO2 Budget Trading Rule through which Pennsylvania will participate with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).&nbsp;This program sets a cap for allowable carbon pollution from electric generation and requires that facilities purchase an allowance for each ton of CO2 they emit.</p>

<p>Facing significant pressure from the legislature, this program included&mdash;and then expanded&mdash;yet another handout for waste coal generation.&nbsp;The program sets aside 12.8 million allowances that, if needed, will be given to waste coal generation for free.&nbsp;As a result, waste coal facilities can nearly double their 2019 generation and dump all the resulting pollution in the air without paying the fees other polluters must pay.&nbsp;Of course, the citizens of Pennsylvania will still pay the price for increased pollution and we will all suffer the worsening effects of climate change if we don&rsquo;t focus on cutting harmful emissions.</p>

<p><u>Chasing bitcoin is a bad investment for Pennsylvania</u></p>

<p>After totaling up all the subsidies, Stronghold claims it will only be paying $18 per megawatt-hour of electricity&mdash;or $11/MWh less than average on our power grid.&nbsp;That is an amazingly low rate, if true, but it&rsquo;s far from a sure thing.&nbsp;Their projections are based on about $16 in direct handouts for each ton of waste coal they burn, plus free carbon allowances that may be worth in the neighborhood of $8 per ton.</p>

<p>Even if the company receives all of those handouts, it still may not be able to operate as cheaply as they claim.&nbsp;In addition to these highly optimistic predictions, they are relying on indirect subsidies in the form of weak regulation&mdash;specifically that the EPA will not correct the abuses of the Trump administration, which weakened the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, among other rules.</p>

<p>Those cheap operating costs also have a big price.&nbsp;They neglect the very real costs of public health and environmental damage caused by the excess air pollution&mdash;particularly in the vulnerable communities near these plants.&nbsp;The negative externalities these plants cause but don&rsquo;t pay for, when reduced to dollar values, the citizens of Pennsylvania paying for all these damages could end up being the single largest subsidy the facility receives.</p>

<p>Even if we pay the high prices and accept all the harms, this isn&rsquo;t a sustainable long-term business model.&nbsp;By design, the number of bitcoins one receives for mining a new block decreases over time and, if the value of each coin rises, the competition only gets more intense.&nbsp;This creates a highly-competitive industry with miners flocking to wherever electricity is cheap.&nbsp;Even if sites like Scrubgrass make sense today, things can change quickly if we don&rsquo;t keep ramping up the handouts.</p>

<p>There is a better way.&nbsp;According to <a href=""https://arippa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ARIPPA-Report-FINAL-June-2019.pd"">the waste coal industry&rsquo;s own numbers</a>, proper disposal of the waste piles would only cost $33 per ton and other options, such as stabilizing the piles by planting beach grass, could be far cheaper.&nbsp;Instead of forcing Pennsylvanians to hand over their hard-earned money to an industry that turns one form of pollution into another, we should be putting people to work actually solving the problem of coal waste.</p>

<p>If Stronghold wants to truly be a sustainable and environmentally beneficial company, it should ditch dirty coal and source its energy from cheaper, scalable, and rapidly growing renewable energy.&nbsp;If not, it&rsquo;s no better than the other major polluters in Pennsylvania or the failed coal companies that left these mountains of waste coal behind in the first place.</p>

"PennFuture, Partners Challenge DEP's Approval of Renovo Energy Center",8/10/2021,"<p>If we are truly committed to moving to a renewable energy economy, rather than a fossil-fuel based economy, the first step is to stop building new fossil fuel infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pennsylvania is struggling with that first step.&nbsp; The Department of Environmental Protection recently approved the application for the construction of the <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/About/Regional/North-central-Regional-Office/Community-Information/Pages/Renovo-Energy-Center-.aspx"">Renovo Energy Center</a>, a proposed 1240-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Clinton County PA. If completed, this facility will be one of ten largest emitters of carbon pollution fossil-fuel power plants in Pennsylvania and could emit more than two million tons of carbon pollution every year. Any new polluting industry in PA poses a threat, but with the ever-worsening climate crisis the time for completing a clean energy transition is running out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, PennFuture and our partners, Clean Air Council and the Center for Biological Diversity, <a href=""https://ehb.courtapps.com/efile/documentViewer.php?documentID=52766"">are challenging the DEP&rsquo;s issuance of this approval</a> to the Renovo Energy Center. We believe that some of DEP&rsquo;s own policies were violated in approving this plant. Among other issues, we contend that DEP failed to follow its own Environmental Justice Participation Policy and misapplied analyses regarding best available control technology (BACT) as well as required cost-benefit analyses. We also allege that DEP violated Article I, Section 27, of the PA Constitution, also known as the Environmental Rights Amendment.</p>

<p>First, we contend in our challenge that DEP failed to properly take into account that this plant is slated to be in an environmental justice (EJ). These communities, <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/OfficeofEnvironmentalJustice/Pages/PA-Environmental-Justice-Areas.aspx"">defined in Pennsylvania</a> as &ldquo;any census tract where 20 percent or more individuals live at or below the federal poverty line, and/or 30 percent or more of the population identifies as a non-white minority,&rdquo; have long been subjected to environmental racism. Industrial facilities are usually built among poor or minority communities, leaving them at higher risk of water and air pollution from the facilities.</p>

<p>Furthermore, across the globe, these communities are often the ones being hid the hardest by the climate crisis. The Renovo plant not only will create industrial pollution in this community but will also further contribute to climate change, which is already harming vulnerable populations the most. The Department&rsquo;s own <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=7918&amp;DocName=ENVIRONMENTAL%20JUSTICE%20PUBLIC%20PARTICIPATION%20POLICY.PDF%20"">environmental justice public participation policy</a> was implemented to increase engagement in these communities and ensure they have a say in the developments that occur in their neighborhoods. This policy includes meetings with local community stakeholders, distribution of information about proposed projects in a manner accessible to members of the local community, and formal and informal public meetings where community members can seek answers and voice their concerns. Unfortunately, these steps do not seem to have been taken here, and the DEP has authorized the Renovo plant to be built without following its own policy to consult with the local community.</p>

<p>Second, we contend that DEP did not properly conduct the required BACT analysis to determine the &ldquo;best available control technology.&rdquo; The analysis requires proposals to consider whether there are any other options that are cleaner and more efficient that will adequately meet the needs of the facility. However, for this facility, the only analysis that was conducted was to compare turbines from three different manufacturers and choose the one with the lowest overall emissions. However, this approach lumps together different categories of emissions, and emissions of different chemicals are not all the same. We contend that this was against the requirements of BACT.</p>

<p>Third, cost benefit analyses are an important step in the permitting process and have long been required under state and federal law. However, in the permitting for the Renovo plant, these analyses failed to consider the public harms of plant. One prime example is the social cost of carbon and other greenhouse gases. The &ldquo;social cost&rdquo; is a way of estimating the harm that something will do and the eventual expense of remediating it. The Biden administration <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cost-of-carbon-pollution-pegged-at-51-a-ton/"">has set the social cost of carbon at $51 a ton</a>, methane at $1500 a ton and nitrous oxide at $18000 a ton. Numbers such as these must be considered when estimating the &ldquo;costs&rdquo; of the plant in order to have an accurate cost benefit analysis, yet this part of the process was sorely lacking.</p>

<p>Lastly, we assert that the construction of this new plant is a violation of Pennsylvania citizens&rsquo; rights under Article I, Section 27 of the state constitution, <a href=""https://blogs.law.widener.edu/envirolawcenter/files/2010/03/PA_Citizens_Guide_to_Art_I_Sect_27.pdf"">known as the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA)</a>. Under the ERA, &ldquo;The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania&#39;s public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.&rdquo; This means that only do Pennsylvania citizens have a guaranteed right to clean air, but so do the future residents and citizens of Pennsylvania who have not even been born yet. Air pollution from this plant and the ever-present threat of climate change poses a serious threat of these guaranteed rights. As an agent of the commonwealth, DEP has a responsibility to protect and maintain these rights, not permit them to be trampled by industrial pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This proposed plant is important because not only will it contribute pollution directly into the environment of Renovo and Clinton County, but it also perpetuates use of fracked gas and the corresponding carbon emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, in fact, <a href=""https://www.puc.pa.gov/General/publications_reports/pdf/EPO_2019.pdf"">already exports a quarter of the power generated here</a>, so any energy generated by this facility will not benefit the people of the Commonwealth who will be most harmed by the project. Pennsylvania could be a leader of the green energy economy and move away from dirty gas plants such as this.&nbsp; It is critical we do not waste that chance by continuing to support dangerous fracked gas plants. By challenging DEP&rsquo;s approval of the Renovo Energy Center, PennFuture continues the fight for a greener, cleaner environment for all.</p>

What You Won't Hear During the Aug. 17 Public Hearing on Pipelines in Pennsylvania,8/9/2021,"<p>The Pennsylvania House of Representatives&rsquo; Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committee has announced a <a href=""https://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2021/08/house-environmental-committee-sets-aug.html"">&ldquo;Public Hearing on Environmental and Economic Benefits of Pipelines&rdquo;</a> scheduled for August 17, 2021. However, even the quickest of research would show that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s pipelines have not been environmentally friendly, economically sustainable, safe, or at all &ldquo;beneficial&rdquo; to the average&nbsp;citizen.</p>

<p>Nearly two years ago to the day of this writing, PennFuture&rsquo;s blog highlighted <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Problem-with-Pipelines"">&ldquo;The Problem with Pipelines,&rdquo;</a> which listed what amounted to nearly 100 violations placed by the PA Department of Environmental Protection and over $13 million in fines on the Mariner East II pipeline. This aforementioned pipeline was constructed by Texas-based Energy Transfer, the group behind the infamous Dakota Access Pipeline. Since the writing of that blog post, <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/hearing-on-mariner-east-2-reroute-shows-public-rifts-persist-over-pipeline-project/"">the violations have now reached 121</a> and exceeded $15 million in total fines due to its continued leaks of drilling mud, disturbance to local water wells, pollution of water bodies, and the creation of sinkholes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mariner East II represents a fraction of <a href=""http://pasenategop.com/consumer/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2018/03/Chairman-Brown-Testimony.pdf"">the 81,213 miles of pipelines in Pennsylvania</a>, which includes gas distribution mains (48,139 miles), natural gas distribution services (28,933 miles), natural gas gathering lines (799 miles), natural gas transmission lines (1,275 miles) and hazardous liquids (2,067 miles). This does not include the <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2015/08/04/unmapped-unregulated-maze-of-rural-pipelines-poses-hidden-risks/"">tens of thousands of miles of unmapped natural gas gathering lines</a> vulnerable to being hit by construction equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Environmentally Unfriendly</u></p>

<p>Pipeline leaks and explosions are common in Pennsylvania, leading to harmful effects on the environment.</p>

<p>Between March 16 (the start of the first COVID-19 lockdown in PA) and September 2020, the Mariner East II pipeline alone <a href=""https://www.fractracker.org/2020/09/mariner-east-2-causes-dozens-of-spills-since-lockdown-300-in-total/"">was responsible for 36 spills</a>, releasing over 10,000 gallons of drilling fluid&mdash;most of which poured into Marsh Creek Lake in Marsh Creek State Park. This adds to the total 344,590 &ndash; 405,990 known gallons spilled into the environment since the beginning of the pipeline&rsquo;s construction in 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2016, a natural gas pipeline in Westmoreland County <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/local/westmoreland/2016/04/29/Emergency-crews-respond-to-gas-well-explosion-in-Westmoreland-County-pennsylvania/stories/201604290161"">exploded and injured one person</a> while destroying 40 acres of farmland and causing property damage.</p>

<p>In 2018, the then-brand new Revolution&nbsp;pipeline <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2021/03/02/revolution-pipeline-part-of-which-exploded-in-2018-is-back-in-service/"">exploded in Beaver County</a>, causing property and natural resource damage, and has so far resulted in fines and penalties of over $30 million by DEP.</p>

<p>Last year,&nbsp;Attorney General Josh Shapiro <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/pennsylvania-fracking-hydraulic-fracturing-attorney-general-josh-shapiro-20200625.html"">released a grand jury report on the entire fracked gas industry</a> in Pennsylvania. This report showed the harmful effects of the toxic waste produced by the industry, including the harmful effects of the drilling process which resulted in physical illnesses on nearby residents and water contamination in the form of black sludge clogging well-water pumps that cost homeowners thousands of dollars to fix.</p>

<p>Recently, the Agronomic Crops Network at Ohio State University <a href=""https://agcrops.osu.edu/newsletter/corn-newsletter/24-2021/does-pipeline-installation-have-lasting-effect-crop-yields"">released a study</a> showing that nearby crop yields decreased once pipelines were installed. Specifically, &ldquo;corn grain yields decreased an average of 23.8%, silage corn decreased an average of 28.8%, and soybean yield decreased an average of 7.4% over the pipeline compared with adjacent areas.&rdquo; Pennsylvania State University <a href=""https://extension.psu.edu/calculating-crop-damage-payments-in-natural-gas-pipeline-negotiations"">released a similar report in 2015.</a></p>

<p>And this is just a sample of some of the most destructive catastrophes caused by pipeline construction and operation; it doesn&rsquo;t include the thousands of stream crossings, miles of forest clearcutting, and smaller but no less harmful spills across the Commonwealth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Economically Unsustainable</u></p>

<p>Pipeline mileage in Pennsylvania <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/ProgramIntegration/PITF/Meetings/9-23-15/Pipeline%20Development%20-%20Strategies%20and%20Tools%20to%20Minimize%20Landscape%20Impacts.pdf"">is set to quadruple between 2015 and 2030</a>, despite the known continued harmful effects on people and the environment and <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47076"">signs of a slowing down</a> and possible decrease in consumption through 2050.</p>

<p>Greener, more environmentally friendly energy alternatives are already proving to not only be both <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=5128549c2c84"">cost effective for producers and consumers</a>, but also offer <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimmagill/2020/10/26/oil-gas-vs-clean-energy-which-will-have-best-jobs-in-the-future/?sh=51d9704c5738"">higher-paying wages</a> for those in the green energy job sector.</p>

<p>More on the former point, <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42495"">U.S. Energy Information Administration&rsquo;s (EIA) data</a> predicted solar and wind energy would dominate America&rsquo;s new energy generation in 2020. EIA also projected natural gas generation <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42497"">to only grow 1.3% in 2020</a> &ndash; the slowest rate since 2017 &ndash; while non-hydropower renewable energy generation will grow 15% in 2020, the fastest rate in four years. Early, actual 2020 reports <a href=""https://www.irena.org/newsroom/pressreleases/2021/Apr/World-Adds-Record-New-Renewable-Energy-Capacity-in-2020"">are beginning to show that solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources</a> &ldquo;beat earlier estimates and all previous records despite the economic slowdown that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic...exceeding expansion in 2019 by close to 50 percent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the last decade, wind energy prices have fallen 70% and solar photovoltaics have fallen 89% on average, <a href=""https://www.lazard.com/perspective/lcoe2019"">according to a 2019 report</a>. Utility-scale renewable energy prices are now <a href=""https://energyinnovation.org/2018/01/22/renewable-energy-levelized-cost-of-energy-already-cheaper-than-fossil-fuels-and-prices-keep-plunging/"">significantly below those for coal and gas generation</a>. Experts and analysts <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/06/09/plunging-renewable-energy-prices-mean-us-can-hit-90-clean-electricity-by-2035at-no-extra-cost/?sh=54f12a7d2f9b"">have claimed that</a>, with wind, solar, and storage prices <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/#7cbce6f2c84e"">falling at such a fast rate</a>, the United States can reach 90% clean electricity by 2035&nbsp;without raising customer costs at all from today&rsquo;s levels, and actually decreasing wholesale power costs 10%. In other words, renewable energy sources <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2019/03/26/the-coal-cost-crossover-74-of-us-coal-plants-now-more-expensive-than-new-renewables-86-by-2025/#7f5abb5322d9"">are now cheaper than the average cost to operate coal</a>, the average cost <a href=""https://rmi.org/the-climate-opportunity-of-clean-energy-portfolios/"">to build new natural gas sites</a>, and can be great for the consumer&rsquo;s bottom line.</p>

<p>On the latter point, compared with jobs in the coal, natural gas and petroleum industries, jobs in solar and wind <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimmagill/2020/10/26/oil-gas-vs-clean-energy-which-will-have-best-jobs-in-the-future/?sh=51d9704c5738"">pay about 50 cents more</a>, and this industry is only at the beginning of its ascendancy. Specifically, wind and solar electricians -- HVAC technicians, mechanics, welders and assemblers -- <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimmagill/2020/10/26/oil-gas-vs-clean-energy-which-will-have-best-jobs-in-the-future/?sh=51d9704c5738"">get paid $2.50 more than their counterparts</a> in the coal and gas industry. Clean energy jobs are more likely to be union jobs than jobs across the economy as a whole &ndash; <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimmagill/2020/10/26/oil-gas-vs-clean-energy-which-will-have-best-jobs-in-the-future/?sh=51d9704c5738"">9 percent versus 6 percent</a> &ndash; which correlates to higher pay and better benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As America faces an economy post-COVID 19, the green energy sector presents an avenue to create jobs on a massive, interstate scale <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/09/10/how-clean-energy-jobs-can-power-an-equitable-covid-19-recovery/"">that includes a diverse workforce of people</a> with varying levels of education and skillset. Such a new economy cannot be realized without proper investment, and Pennsylvania, facing the brunt of the dying fossil fuel industry, is the perfect place to rise to the moment and invest.</p>

<p><u>Unbeneficial to the Public&nbsp;</u></p>

<p>In addition to being bad for the environment and being economically unsustainable, these pipelines are not beneficial to the general public.</p>

<p>One analysis showed that <a href=""https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/pa-mariner-east-pipeline-accident-emergency-plans-investigation/"">as many as 345,000 people live close enough</a> to the Mariner East pipeline system alone to be affected by a leak or serious explosion. Pipelines are consistently built and expanded <a href=""https://www.bayjournal.com/news/energy/pipeline-projects-draw-criticism-for-environmental-racism/article_99af061e-a98e-11ea-bcdf-33bf50122f39.html"">in areas where poorer individuals live</a>, including poorer whites, but especially Black, and other minority communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of celebrating pipelines and pretending that they do not lead to catastrophic harm to people and the environment, we should be examining how to phase them out and phase Pennsylvania into the newer, greener economy emerging nationally&nbsp;and worldwide. At the very least, we must be discussing ways to secure populations living near these pipelines a level of compensation for when disaster strikes due to these pipelines.</p>

<p>Unlike what is necessary to own a home or a vehicle, operators of pipelines carrying gasoline, natural gas, natural gas liquids and other hazardous and explosive substances <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vzM4MwrRlTBlCq3-XnOdeCdrt4UxbtHuSNeyRbvAK5Y/edit"">are not required by law to have insurance</a> or <a href=""https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/railroaded-by-the-gas-industry/"">a financial assurance plan</a>. One policy analysis postures that pipeline insurance would 1) ensure that financial resources exist to compensate injured parties; and 2) grant injured third parties access to remuneration without having to resort to costly litigation. Such insurance is not unusual, as similar environmental programs require insurance-type coverage for <a href=""http://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pacode?file=/secure/pacode/data/025/chapter86/s86.168.html&amp;d=reduce"">surface coal mine operators</a>, <a href=""http://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pacode?file=/secure/pacode/data/025/chapter90/chap90toc.html&amp;d="">coal refuse disposal areas</a>, and <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=3480118&amp;DocName=PROCESSING%20AND%20BENEFICIAL%20USE%20OF%20OIL%20AND%20GAS%20LIQUID%20WASTE.PDF%20%20%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3Agreen%3B%22%3E%3C%2Fspan%3E%20%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3Ablue%3B%22%3E(NEW)%3C%2Fspan%3E"">oil and gas well drilling wastewater treatment facilities</a>, just to name a few. This coverage is especially important as Mariner East II and other pipelines have a long and constantly growing track record of explosions and leaks.</p>

<p>The perceived, fabricated, economic &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; of pipelines cannot be mentioned without also highlighting pipelines&rsquo; proclivity to wreak havoc and destruction on our communities, as well as our shared environment and natural resources. It is clear that pipelines are unfriendly to the lands of Pennsylvania we call home, unsustainable economically as the world chases greener alternatives -- a new economy that Pennsylvania could take the lead in with proper investment, and harmful to the citizens of the Commonwealth in a multifaceted amount of ways. Simply highlighting these false &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; is disingenuous and clearly in the pursuit of a self-serving agenda.&nbsp;</p>

"Stakeholders Making Progress on Chesapeake Bay Goals, but Legislature Still Lagging",8/2/2021,"<p>On July 28th, <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/Pennsylvania%E2%80%99s%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Program%20Office/WIP3/Pages/Public-Meetings.aspx"">the Chesapeake Bay State Team</a>, led by the Secretaries of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), and the Department of Agriculture (PDA), met to hear updates on the progress on the implementation of the Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) and what&rsquo;s coming next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short, a lot of work is being done by the DEP and other state agencies, as well as the County Action Teams, to get&nbsp; Pennsylvania on track to meet its goals set by the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). After years of lackluster planning and implementation, Pennsylvania and the other Bay states should celebrate the huge strides that are underway over the last two years since the completion of the Phase 3 WIP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there is one critical area with few successes to report: the legislature&rsquo;s progress to provide adequate funding to meet our clean water goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Areas of Progress</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>Countywide Action Plans</li>
</ul>

<p>The Phase 3 WIP breaks up watershed restoration into county planning and implementation efforts, <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/Pennsylvania%E2%80%99s%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Program%20Office/WIP3/GetInvolved/Pages/Countywide-Action-Plans.aspx"">called County Action Plans</a>. The 43 counties in the watershed were divided into two phases, depending on how much nitrogen and phosphorus they contribute to our streams. The eight Phase 1 counties are already implementing their plans and reporting progress back to DEP. The remaining Phase 2 counties are grouped into 10 clusters with plans due to DEP by the end of September. The local county-level efforts will help to catalyze and report action on the ground and provide DEP with input on what is needed to be successful.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Rapid Delisting Strategy</li>
</ul>

<p>The Lancaster Clean Water Partners, working with the Chesapeake Conservancy, put together a data-driven rapid delisting strategy for impaired, or polluted, waters to help prioritize the work being done in Lancaster County, which accounts for 21% of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nitrogen reduction goals and 23% for phosphorus. This prioritization strategy is based on how healthy an impaired stream is, existing work within a watershed, and is focused on large landowners. Out of 5,100 farms in the county, the Lancaster CAP prioritizes 1,200 farms which helps technical service providers and other conservation organizations to know where focused efforts could make the biggest impact on local stream health. The delisting strategy could be used in other counties to speed up improvements to local stream health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Center for Water Quality Excellence</li>
</ul>

<p>The Phase 3 WIP proposed the creation of a pilot <a href=""https://www.cwqe.org/"">Center for Water Quality Excellence</a>, led by PENNVEST, where municipalities, farmers, and other interested parties could go to learn more about best management practices and funding opportunities. The pilot Center is now open to serve Lancaster and York Counties. If this model proves to be successful, PENNVEST could open other locations to serve additional counties. In addition to providing one-on-one consulting opportunities, the Center will be offering workshops.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Phase 3 WIP Amendment and Milestone Reporting&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>At EPA&rsquo;s request, DEP will submit an amendment to the Phase 3 WIP by the end of the year. The original Phase 3 WIP fell short on its plan to achieve the nitrogen reduction goal. The amendment is expected to include the 34 County Action Plans and the implementation and adjustments that have happened over the past 2 years. DEP pointed out challenges will be included in the document, including the COVID pandemic stalling progress due to the lost of construction season and increased construction costs. In addition, as part of the accountability framework of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL, DEP provides milestone reports to EPA for progress and on 2-year commitments. We eagerly await the Phase 3 Amendment and milestone reporting to assess progress toward Pennsylvania&rsquo;s goals and to see if the state has a complete plan to meet 100% of the nitrogen goal.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Where progress is still lacking&nbsp;</u></p>

<p>Despite all the work being done by the state agencies and partners on the ground, this meeting reaffirmed funding from the legislature remains the main hurdle to overcome.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We call on the legislature to take swift action on the following policies when they return to Harrisburg in late September.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>SB 465 would create a new statewide agricultural cost share program providing farmers and landowners with assistance to install conservation practices which benefit clean water and farms. The program would be administered by the State Conservation Commission and local decisions would be made through County Conservation Districts. These investments would prioritize counties where agriculture has a greater impact on stream health.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Growing Greener III&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>SB 525 would invest $500 million of the federal American Rescue Plan to reinvigorate the state&rsquo;s Growing Greener Program that was passed with bipartisan support over 20 years ago. This program supports community-driven work conservation and clean water projects across the state.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Clean Streams Fund</li>
</ul>

<p>A cosponsor memo by Senator Yaw calls for $250 million of federal American Rescue Plan money to be directed to a water quality improvement dedicated fund. This funding could help improve stream health that is impacted by nonpoint source runoff, such as agriculture, acid mine drainage, and stormwater runoff.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Lawn Fertilizer Bill</li>
</ul>

<p>SB 251 would significantly improve the water quality impacted by nutrient pollution in Pennsylvania by reducing application rates of lawn fertilizer, creating a professional certification program, and standardizing label requirements for lawns, golf courses, and athletic fields. Over 2,600 miles of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s streams are impaired due to excess nutrients, which is the fifth leading cause of water pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The countdown to December 31, 2025 grows shorter everyday. The state agencies and counties are doing their part to build the systems and programs to get the job done. It&rsquo;s far past time for the legislature to step up to the plate. And right now, with&nbsp; $7 billion in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan, there are no longer any excuses remaining to hold off on investing in our state&rsquo;s clean water resources, which benefit the economy, create and sustain jobs, and improve quality of life and public health. Swift action on the legislation mentioned here would be a good start in the right direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It's Time to Reimagine America's Infrastructure,7/29/2021,"<p>As Congress continues to push towards a potential infrastructure package, residents of the Queen Village neighborhood in Philadelphia were reminded just how desperately we need to reinvest in &ndash; and reinvent &ndash; <a href=""https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2021/07/25/queen-village-30-inch-water-main-break-flooding/"">our nation&rsquo;s crumbling infrastructure.</a> A 30-inch water main broke after midnight Sunday and flooded nearby streets, businesses, and homes, resulting in untold damages for residents in the area.</p>

<p>The City of Philadelphia confirmed that the broken cast iron pipe was originally installed in 1891. The Philadelphia Water Department <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/kywnewsradio/news/local/overnight-water-main-break-floods-homes-leaves-giant-hole"">said this</a>: &quot;It&#39;s one of our oldest in our system. We try to get as much life out of them as long as we can, obviously this one reached the end of its life and we&rsquo;re trying to deal with the situation right now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking that this is an isolated incident involving an ancient pipe from the Gilded Age and moving on with your life. But, 15 percent of the city water mains <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/like-an-asteroid-struck-bella-vista-residents-survey-damage-after-massive-water-main-break/?utm_campaign=sproutsocial&amp;utm_content=1627321324&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_source=twitter"">were installed before 1900</a>. It has been reported that Philadelphia has approximately 3,200 miles of pipe, which means that 480 miles of pipe were built at a time when horses were still the primary mode of transportation.</p>

<p>There is so much to admire about the built world that we were able to create through advances in technology and the sheer audacity of the human spirit. I am sure that there was a time when cast iron water main pipes were revolutionary. Now, towns and cities across America are squeezing the last life out of creaking and groaning infrastructure that cannot possibly be expected to deal with the challenges presented by climate change.</p>

<p>We are seeing the troubling signs of climate change across the globe: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/world/asia/china-climate-change.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage"">flooding in China</a>, heat and monsoons <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/world/asia/india-landslides-floods.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage"">in India</a>, a tropical storm <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-evacuates-thousands-monsoon-rains-flood-cities-provinces-2021-07-24/"">in the Philippines</a>, and heavy rainfall <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/world/europe/flooding-germany-belgium-switzerland-netherlands.html"">in Western Europe</a>. We are experiencing similar phenomena in America, too, as temperatures continue to rise and heavy rains continue to fall. We are also experiencing the damage done to our homes and businesses as our aged infrastructure struggles to keep pace with a harsher climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This weekend&rsquo;s water main break is only the latest indication that we risk far more by doing nothing than what we risk with a novel approach to rebuild our nation&rsquo;s infrastructure. Queen Village residents have called the scene &ldquo;apocalyptic&rdquo; and likened the latest sinkhole to an asteroid strike. This comes only months after <a href=""https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2021/02/16/cars-stranded-flooded-street-after-water-main-break-in-north-philadelphia/"">a 48-inch water main break in North Philadelphia</a> forced emergency responders to rescue nearly a dozen people by boat. Another water main break formed <a href=""https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2021/02/08/sinkhole-swallows-suv-after-12-inch-water-main-break-in-philadelphias-logan-neighborhood/"">a sinkhole that swallowed an SUV.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>The current push to rebuild our nation&rsquo;s infrastructure also presents us with our best opportunity to reimagine our nation&rsquo;s infrastructure. If we are truly willing to invest trillions of dollars into building back better, then let&rsquo;s make sure we do just that. Philadelphia&rsquo;s water mains are bursting at the seams due to wear and tear, but it would be a mistake to focus on upgrading pipes that were built before Theodore Roosevelt became President. The best way to build back better is to chart a new course that does not rely on pipes and pavement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The City of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Water Department have been working to address its aging infrastructure for nearly ten years. Beginning in 2011, the city sought a new way to rebuild its stormwater infrastructure to better combat polluted runoff and the impact of heavy floods through green stormwater infrastructure (GSI). The Green City, Clean Waters program <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Report-highlights-success-of-Philadelphias-Green-City-Clean-Waters-Program"">is a proven model for success</a> that represents truly fundamental change in the way we think of infrastructure in America. Prioritizing nature-based solutions that promote people over pavement allows municipalities to simultaneously increase preparedness for the impact of climate change and begin to address the harm caused to communities of color through decades of deliberate exclusion and disinvestment. GSI projects that incorporate green space like tree trenches and rain gardens provide relief to urban communities through reducing air temperatures and helping to <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/isaias-emergency-eastwick-residents-call-for-city-state-aid-after-devastating-flooding/"">decrease the risk of flooding.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Cities across the world <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/europe/london-flooding-infrastructure-climate-intl-cmd/index.html?utm_term=link&amp;utm_source=twCNN&amp;utm_content=2021-07-26T21%3A00%3A12&amp;utm_medium=social"">are grappling with the grim reality</a> that they are not prepared for the impact of climate change. There are those in America who will tell us that we cannot afford to reimagine our nation&rsquo;s infrastructure. They will argue that American ingenuity cannot account for the weather. Senators will <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/infrastructure-talks-near-finish-as-senators-face-time-pressure"">balk at increased spending</a> to deal with the myriad issues plaguing our nation&rsquo;s water systems. We can choose to squeeze the very last drop of life out of pipes better left to a bygone age. We know what the consequences will be: swift-water rescues to save people from drowning in city streets, sinkholes swallowing SUVs, and millions in damages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But American ingenuity did not die in 1981, 1891, or 1776. We only must choose to face this next great challenge with the same audacity and creativity that led us to create the built world that surrounds us. There are models like Philadelphia&rsquo;s Green City, Clean Waters program across the country. Municipalities and residents have been forced to go it alone for far too long. This moment demands federal action that prioritizes infrastructure that is cost-effective, sustainable, clean, and green.&nbsp;</p>

Pennsylvania Supreme Court Rules that Drilling Revenues from State Forests Must be Used for Conservation,7/28/2021,"<p>Last week, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court <a href=""https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-78-2020mo - 104840407140939594.pdf?cb=1"">ruled that it is unconstitutional under the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA)</a> for the General Assembly to transfer oil and gas lease funds designated for environmental conservation to the general fund for non-conservation purposes. This decision, appropriately dubbed &ldquo;PEDF IV,&rdquo; concludes a six-year legal battle between the Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Foundation (PEDF) and the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The General Assembly established a lease fund in 1955 under the Lease Fund Act to receive &ldquo;all rents and royalties from oil and gas leases&rdquo; on Commonwealth land, and exclusively dedicated to environmental conservation purposes. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resource (DCNR) is charged with overseeing all oil and gas leases and contracts on these publicly owned lands, and all moneys in the fund are to be appropriated to the DCNR for carrying out the purpose of the fund.</p>

<p>From 1955 to 2008, the leases generated a total of $165 million. Then in 2009, the DCNR leased approximately 74,000 acres for Marcellus Shale drilling which generated close to $600 million. These revenues were made up of upfront bonus payments, annual rental fees, royalties for the marketable gas extracted, and interest penalties for late payments. Inspired by the large influx of revenue, the General Assembly added four new provisions to the Fiscal Code which essentially worked to restrict the allocation of lease fund monies to DCNR and redirect them to the general fund to help balance the state budget. This marked the start of the PEDF litigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2017, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court established in PEDF II that the ERA, Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, creates an express public trust subject to Pennsylvania private trust law with the purpose of conserving and maintaining the state&rsquo;s public natural resources &ldquo;for the benefit of all the people.&rdquo; The ERA designates the Commonwealth as trustee, the people as the named beneficiaries, and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources as the corpus (or body) of the trust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PEDF II critically and clearly accepted the Pennsylvania Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2016 plurality&rsquo;s holding in Robinson Township v. Commonwealth, that this public trust imposes trustee obligations on the Commonwealth to (1) prohibit the degradation, diminution, and depletion of our public natural resources, whether these harms might result from direct state action or from the actions of private parties, and (2) the Commonwealth must act affirmatively via legislative action to protect the environment. It also rejected the previous three-part ERA test set forth in <em>Payne v. Kassab.</em></p>

<p>The PEDF II Court also ruled that two of the Fiscal Code provisions relating to oil and gas royalties (1602-E and 1603-E) were facially unconstitutional because they directed the royalties away from the trust corpus. Remember, the corpus under the ERA is Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources, and PEDF II had to figure out what to do if those natural resources are sold.&nbsp; According to Pennsylvania private trust law, revenue from the sale of trust assets constitute trust principle, and trust principle must remain part of the corpus of the trust. Royalties from the sale of oil and gas represent the sale of trust assets, and are therefore trust principle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court then remanded the case back to the Commonwealth court to determine whether the other two provisions transferring money from the lease fund to the general fund (1604-E and 1605-E) were also unconstitutional. This required a determination of how the other revenues (the bonus payments, annual rental fees, and interest penalties) should be categorized under private trust law principles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking a step back, typically in an oil and gas lease, the company pays several different payments for the lease/right to extract. The bonus payment is a one-time payment made by the company to secure the lease during a formal bidding process. The company then pays an annual rental fee to maintain its right to explore the area for oil and gas. Interest penalties are penalties related to late rental payments. Finally, the company pays royalties to the commonwealth based on the amount of marketable gas it extracts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under Pennsylvania private trust law, rental payments generated from trust assets are classified as trust income and can be distributed to trust beneficiaries. On remand in 2019, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court in PEDF III determined that the rents, bonuses, and interest penalties constitute income, and interpreted the ERA to recognize two distinct classes of beneficiaries: the current living citizens of Pennsylvania as life tenants and all future citizens as remaindermen. The court determined that since the ERA didn&rsquo;t specify how the proceeds should be allocated between successive beneficiaries (the life tenants and remaindermen) the trust laws from when the ERA was adopted (the 1947 Principle Income Act) would govern, thereby directing the income to go to the life tenants. This led the court to conclude that the transfer of revenue to the general fund was constitutional as it represented income distributed to the trust&rsquo;s life tenants. PEDF then appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week&rsquo;s decision reversed PEDF III on the grounds that the ERA does not in fact establish successive trust beneficiaries, and therefore the 1947 trust laws concerning apportionment among successive beneficiaries do not apply. The Commonwealth Court in PEDF III interpreted the phrase &ldquo;for the benefit of all the people&rdquo; in the ERA in isolation to mean that allocating the trust income to the general budget would benefit all the people, and would therefore be permissible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In discussing the ERA, the Court explained that &ldquo;[t]he text does not distinguish between &lsquo;current Pennsylvanians&rsquo; and future generations. Instead, generations yet to come are included within the broadly defined beneficiary: &lsquo;all the people.&rsquo;&rdquo; And as the Court in PEDF II explained, &ldquo;The Commonwealth&rsquo;s fiduciary duty to &ldquo;conserve and maintain&rdquo; our public natural resources is a duty owed to the beneficiaries of the public trust, namely &ldquo;the people, including generations yet to come,&rdquo; as set forth in the second sentence of Section 27.&rdquo; This essentially means that the Commonwealth, as the trustee, cannot distinguish or prioritize the needs of current Pennsylvanians and future Pennsylvanians by spending trust income on general budgetary matters because &ldquo;the ERA created simultaneous beneficiaries with equal interests in the trust&rsquo;s management.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public trusts for natural resources are not a novel concept, and they exist in every state through either constitutional provisions, statutes, or common law (i.e., court decisions) to protect an area&rsquo;s natural resources for the benefit of the present and future public. However, current public trust law for natural resources is vary sparse and lawyers and the courts will often draw on private trust law to help answer questions that arise that are not answered by public trust law &ndash; as was done in the PEDF line of cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While there are no binding rules on the type of trust law that should be used to fill these gaps, some legal professionals <a href=""https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2516&amp;context=mjlr"">have strong opinions on how to apply private trust principles</a> to public trusts so as to uphold the intent and purpose of the public trust. Professor John Dernbach, for example, stresses that the income maximization aspects of private trust law should not be used to define the duties and limits of a public trustee as they are incompatible with the purpose of public trusts for natural resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have also seen recently how these principals can be perverted into an argument in favor of depleting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s natural resources. Pennsylvania State Senators Gene Yaw and Lisa Baker (joined by the Pennsylvania Republican Caucus and several municipalities) <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-Environmental-Groups-Law-Center-File-Friend-of-Court-Brief-in-Opposition-to-Challenge-to-Delaware-River-Basin-Commission-Fracking-Ban"">attempted to challenge a ban on fracking</a> within the Delaware River Basin passed by the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) by essentially arguing that they have public trust duties under section 27 of the ERA as individual legislators to exploit the State&rsquo;s natural resources for economic gain. They argued that the fracking ban harms the Commonwealth and its citizens by &ldquo;interfering with the reasonable investment-backed expectations of landowners,&rdquo; and diminishing the property value of land in the Basin.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Federal-Court-Dismissed-Lawsuit-Challenging-DRBCs-Ban-on-Fracking"">In an unsurprising victory</a>, the District Court <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Opinion-on-Dismissing-Yaw-Suit.pdf"">rejected these arguments</a> on the basis that the two senators are not ERA trustees and have no standing to bring the complaint. Arguments like the one brought by Senators Yaw and Baker which grossly misinterpret the ERA are why it is so important to remain diligent in ensuring that the ERA is used to its fullest and most correct purpose to <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;ttl=00&amp;div=0&amp;chpt=1&amp;sctn=27&amp;subsctn=0"">&ldquo;protect our rights to clean air, water, and the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</a></p>

Maine’s Innovative Response to Plastics Pollution and What the Rest of Us Can Learn From it,7/27/2021,"<p>China remains the world&rsquo;s largest producer of plastic, but&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/us-worlds-number-one-source-plastic-waste-180976214/"">research has shown that the United States</a> was the world&rsquo;s number one source of plastic waste as of 2016, pushing 42 million metric tons into the environment. Americans also use more plastic per capita than any other country on the planet at roughly 286 pounds per person.</p>

<p>Because the U.S. lacks the waste management infrastructure to recycle all its plastic waste, the country transports about half of its recyclable materials to other countries. However, this has been complicated by <a href=""https://www.dw.com/en/amid-plastic-deluge-southeast-asia-refuses-western-waste/a-49467769"">China&rsquo;s 2018 announcement to stop the importation</a> of plastic waste, followed by announcements by other Southeast Asian states such as Thailand in 2021, Vietnam by 2025, India, and even Turkey. Clearly, something must be done to tackle our plastic waste problem in the U.S., and states like Maine might be leading the way and teaching us all a thing or two about finally solving this issue.</p>

<p>According to a 2018 study cited by the Environmental Protection Agency, containers and packaging (namely &ldquo;bags, sacks and wraps; other packaging; polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and jars; high-density polyethylene (HDPE) natural bottles; and other containers&rdquo;) <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/plastics-material-specific-data"">rank&nbsp;as the most used plastic in the U.S.</a> at over 14.5 million tons.</p>

<p>For the past thirty years, U.S. states have begun to pass individual statewide legislation to curb the usage of plastic bags. In 1991, <a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx"">Maine became the first state to enact legislation</a> requiring recycling efforts at retail stores. The law prevents retailers from supplying plastic bags unless they provide a convenient storefront receptacle to ensure used bags are collected and recycled. Since then at least four other states&mdash;California, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island&mdash;and the District of Columbia have followed their lead.</p>

<p>However, as we have previously noted <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Recycling-is-exacerbating-the-plastic-waste-crisis"">in our PennFuture Blog</a>, plastic recycling by the consumer alone will not solve the plastics pollution crisis our global environment is facing, <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-produced-recycling-waste-ocean-trash-debris-environment"">as just 9 percent of global plastic waste</a> is recycled. PennFuture has previously argued that the world must transition away from plastic packaging altogether. As of this writing, eight states&mdash;California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New York, Oregon and Vermont&mdash;<a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx"">have banned single-use plastic bags.</a></p>

<p>Arguably, a major step towards the total elimination of plastic packaging can be seen in Maine&rsquo;s new extended producer responsibility (EPR) policy for packaging which makes it all the more costly for companies to use plastic packaging, among other types as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maine&rsquo;s new EPR law begins to shift the burden on recycling from the consumer to the producer by requiring producers <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/climate/maine-recycling-law-EPR.html"">to cover 100 percent of its municipalities&rsquo; recycling costs.</a> Maine&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90655072/maine-companies-will-now-have-to-pay-to-help-fix-the-broken-recycling-system?utm_source=postup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=world-changing-ideas&amp;position=9&amp;partner=newsletter&amp;campaign_date=07172021"">will set fees for different types of packaging</a>. Companies will be charged on the amount of packaging waste they create in the state, with higher fees charged for materials that are more difficult to recycle. The fees will drop when companies redesign and replace old packaging for more recyclable ones, or increase the amount of recycled content in their packaging. This eco-modulation system &quot;incentivizes less packaging and better packaging&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.wastedive.com/news/extended-producer-responsibility-packaging-maine-oregon/602479/"">according to State Rep. Nicole Grohoski</a>, one of the bill&rsquo;s primary sponsors.</p>

<p>Maine&rsquo;s DEP will partner with a &ldquo;packing stewardship&rdquo; organization that will run the program and will offer companies assistance in designing packaging that better fits the system. The organization will need to report data such as tonnage of packaging collected and provide funding for infrastructure and education improvements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While 33 states currently have EPR laws, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/climate/maine-recycling-law-EPR.html"">they are far more narrow</a>; typically focusing on specific products like used mattresses and tubs of paint. Even in this narrow application, Connecticut&rsquo;s mattress, paint, electronic and thermostat EPR programs have diverted more than 26 million pounds of waste since 2008, <a href=""https://www.productstewardship.us/news/328753/Extended-Producer-Responsibility-Programs-Proven-Successful-in-Connecticut.htm"">according to one study.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Packaging-centric EPR policies have achieved success worldwide as well. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/climate/maine-recycling-law-EPR.html"">In Quebec, Canada</a>, a similar program <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kruger-packaging-invests-250-million-in-the-trois-rivieres-mill-527461141.html"">results in $250 million sent back to communities</a> for recycling purposes each year. Around 63% of packaging <a href=""https://www.clf.org/blog/recycling-reform-producer-responsibility-maine-pollution/"">is recycled in Quebec</a>, versus an average of 25% in the U.S. A study by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality of Canadian EPR programs found that consumer product prices had increased <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/arts/design/recycling-packaging-new-york.html"">by only $0.0056 per item.</a></p>

<p>Plastic pollution is undoubtedly an issue in Pennsylvania. Studies have estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic in our oceans than fish. On average, in a single year, <a href=""https://environmentamerica.org/reports/pac/microplastics-pennsylvania"">the Philadelphia Water Department removes 44 tons</a> of trash from a 32 mile stretch of the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers, 56% of which was plastic waste, according to a PennEnvironment report. In Pennsylvania, plastic is the most common form of visible litter. In fact, the Department of Transportation spends over $13 million every year cleaning up just roadside litter. The problem is so widespread that nine of the largest cities in Pennsylvania spend over $68.5 million every year on litter and illegal dumping, with $46.7 million of that going toward litter abatement.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&#39;s very low cost in sending trash to landfills and incinerators <a href=""https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-introduces-legislation-to-restrict-flow-of-trash-into-pa-from-other-states"">places Pennsylvania as among the largest importers</a> of out-of-state waste in the nation. At the same time, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection, facing cuts in their funding by the legislature, <a href=""https://wjactv.com/news/local/dep-cancels-statewide-recycling-implementation-grants-for-first-time-in-33-years"">has cut grant funding</a> for the state&rsquo;s recycling program in 2021.</p>

<p>With the plastics pollution issue increasing in Pennsylvania in the face of cuts to traditional recycling programs, it is time to change course. Maine has shown us that legislators can stand up to the plastics manufacturers and larger petrochemical industry and force them to take responsibility for the plastic pollution they are putting into the marketplace, and by extension, the environment at virtually no cost to the consumer.&nbsp;</p>

The Problem with Carbon Capture and Sequestration,7/26/2021,"<p>Leaders around the world, including PA Governor, Tom Wolf have been pushing for investments in Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technology. CCS is a technology that pulls carbon out of the air, usually when it is released at facilities like power plants, and buries it underground to keep it from reaching the atmosphere. Some have claimed that this is a miracle technology that will save us from climate change. Yet, there is little support for this staggering claim.</p>

<p>Captured carbon is most often used to directly further the production of fossil fuels from oil and gas fields while providing an overall excuse that our continued reliance on fossil fuels is ok, because CCS will be here to save us. We cannot allow the promise of future carbon reduction to continue to prolong our reliance on technologies that are already causing <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-is-central-to-californias-wildfires/"">devastating consequences to our environment.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mentioned before, CCS is a technology that takes already-released carbon out of the air and transports it to a location where it can be sequestered and kept out of the atmosphere. According to <a href=""https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC_GLOBAL_STATUS_REPORT_2019.pdf"">the Global CCS Institute</a>, as of 2019, global CCS capacity is at around 40 million metric tons of CO2 per year. This is only a drop in the bucket when put in the context <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions"">of the over 36 billion tons a year</a> that is currently being emitted. CCS promises big results in cutting emissions. One facility in Texas for example, <a href=""https://www.nrg.com/case-studies/petra-nova.html"">claims that over a 3-year period</a> between 2016 and 2019 it successfully sequestered 99.08% of carbon emissions, equal to 3,831,818 short tons of CO2. However, in this facility, as in many others, captured carbon is often used to promote more fossil fuel production elsewhere. In reality this means that emissions will be higher as a result of the carbon that was captured.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<u>Background on CCS</u></p>

<p>There are <a href=""https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/carbon-capture-and-storage-101/"">three types of carbon capture technologies</a> that are used to capture the carbon at its source. The most common, particularly in existing power plants, is post combustion carbon capture, where the CO2 is separated from the exhaust that results from the combustion process. Then there is pre-combustion carbon capture which is used in industrial processes but is still in the very early stages for power plants and it is cost prohibitive to try to retrofit an existing powerplant with the technology. In pre-combustion carbon capture, fuel is gasified allowing the CO2 to be separated. Lastly there is oxy-fuel combustion where the fuel is burned in an (almost) pure oxygen environment allowing the CO2 emissions to become more concentrated and thus easier to capture. After the CO2 is captured, it is compressed into a fluid, transported to a storage site, and then eventually injected underground where it can be kept long term to keep from reaching the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Early versions of Carbon capture technology <a href=""https://ieaghg.org/docs/General_Docs/Publications/Information_Sheets_for_CCS_2.pdf"">actually date back to the 1920s</a>, when it was used for separating CO2 that was found in natural gas reservoirs from the saleable methane. Since the 1970s, captured CO2 has been piped to oil fields to boost oil recovery in a process known as <a href=""http://www.netl.doe.gov/oil-gas/oil-recovery"">Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)</a>, leading to millions of tons of CO2 being piped into oil fields every year. Injecting CO2 for EOR can lead to 20-40% higher oil production in an oil field. Although the CO2 can be left there permanently to sequester it, the production of increased oil still leads to this method creating increased carbon emissions. CCS for the sake of keeping carbon out of the atmosphere to try to halt climate change <a href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/beccs-the-story-of-climate-changes-saviour-technology"">gained prominence only in the first years</a> of the new century.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>The Problem with CCS</u></p>

<p>The promise of CCS is dramatically overstated. CCS is not cost efficient. It is extremely expensive and thus cost prohibitive to apply to existing sources of pollution, so the&nbsp;only use case is to construct CCS facilities on new fossil fuel plants. We must stop constructing new fossil fuel plants. Not only are they dangerous, <a href=""https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2020/"">but it is not cost effective</a>. It would be cheaper to construct new wind or solar than to invest in CCS.</p>

<p>Despite showing some early promise, <a href=""https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage"">according to the IEA</a>, as of 2020, there were only 21 CCS facilities operating globally, with another 44 in various stages of development. While CCS may sound promising in concept, it very much remains to be seen whether it will be possible to develop the technology to a scale where it could actually make a significant difference in the climate crisis. It will certainly be extremely expensive, and will draw funds away from renewable energy technology. This could not only delay the construction of renewable energy that is already available but could also delay innovation into new, more advanced forms of clean, renewable energy. This means that we are investing in an unnecessary technology that could never come to fruition instead of trying to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels now with technology that is already ready to be deployed.</p>

<p><u>CCS in Pennsylvania</u></p>

<p>This has been demonstrated be true for Pennsylvania as well. Governor Wolf has announced that PA is joining other states to create a coalition to develop regional CCS infrastructure. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Secretary of the Department of Community and Economic Development, Dennis Davin, has declared that &ldquo;Carbon capture technologies provide a critical component to addressing our climate challenge.&rdquo; In the <a href=""https://carboncaptureready.betterenergy.org/"">announcement mentioned above</a>, the administration shared literature that declares that &ldquo;states are ready for Carbon Capture.&rdquo; However, Governor Wolf&rsquo;s own administration <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/pennsylvania-joins-6-states-in-commitment-to-plan-for-co2-transport-infrastructure/"">clearly seems to disagree.</a></p>

<p>As part of the permitting process for the proposed Renovo Energy Center, a gas fired power plant in Clinton County, the Department of Environmental Protection concluded that currently CCS is not commercially feasible and dismissed it as a way to reduce the emissions of the facility. Standing alone, this might be a plausible conclusion. However, if CCS is really as critical and available as the administration believes, why is the DEP dismissing it as unfeasible for one of the few plants that may have been able to invest in it in PA?&nbsp; CCS is being presented as a pathway to continue moving along an environmentally destructive and carbon-heavy trajectory, while industrial operations are not actually being required to utilize the technology at all.&nbsp; All of this further evidences, as discussed above, that, in reality, CCS is infeasible for any number of new or existing facilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a serious cause for concern that CCS is being held up as a justification to continue to burn fossil fuels indefinitely (while seemingly avoiding the environmental catastrophe the data clearly show is coming) while in practice, CCS <a href=""https://www.utilitydive.com/news/coal-fired-carbon-capture-projects-are-a-waste-of-tax-dollars/602209/"">appears to be a costly</a> (<a href=""https://theclimateconnection.org/carbon-capture-storage-how-cost-effective-is-it/"">and cost ineffective</a>) project with little hope of actually succeeding at the levels needed and <a href=""https://theclimateconnection.org/carbon-capture-should-public-companies-continue-to-fund-it/"">a history of overpromising and underdelivering.</a> The risks <a href=""https://theclimateconnection.org/carbon-capture-and-storage-pros-cons/"">associated with prioritizing CCS</a> include unfair competition for funding and subsidies that could be used for sustainable energy generation like wind or solar and <a href=""https://www.utilitydive.com/news/coal-fired-carbon-capture-projects-are-a-waste-of-tax-dollars/602209/"">also prolonging the life of aging coal and gas plants</a> without actually achieving their goals of large scale carbon capture. So far CCS facilities continuously fallen short of their lofty claims, while the political powers that be are free to rest on their laurels after proclaiming that CCS is about to fix the climate crisis (and continue to throw good money after this inefficient, costly technology).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of averting climate disaster, CCS appears to be another step down our current path of climate destruction under a thin veil of progress. It remains to be seen if CCS will ever manage to create an effective band aid in the fight against climate change, but it is clear that as long as it prolongs our reliance on fossil fuels it will continue to be bring about harm.</p>

What comes next for plastic bags in Pennsylvania?,7/23/2021,"<p>July began with the expiration of a statewide restriction on banning the use of plastic bags. The development is welcomed news for municipalities across the Commonwealth implementing or considering bans on the ubiquitous plastic that too often finds its way into local waterways as litter or becomes a costly contaminant in recycling systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Credit likely goes to the <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/health-lawsuits-coronavirus-pandemic-philadelphia-environment-76b04dcd3e8c2b21d5a467e0f2e56cc8"">legal challenge led by Philadelphia and other Southeastern Pennsylvania municipalities</a> and joined by Pittsburgh. Their lawsuit likely discouraged the General Assembly&rsquo;s Republican leadership from renewing the bag-ban moratorium.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally passed in 2019, the amendment to Act 23 prohibited enacting or enforcing any tax that would discourage the use or sale of single-use plastic. After the General Assembly extended the one-year restriction in 2020, this year the July 1 extension deadline came and went as quietly as a plastic bag drifting in the wind.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/news/2021/06/philadelphia-and-pittsburgh-move-ahead-with-plastic-bag-bans-as-pas-preemption-nears-its-end.html"">Media reports suggest &ldquo;pending litigation&rdquo;</a> that revealed the moratorium&rsquo;s unconstitutional approach may have played a role in legislators&rsquo; decision not to extend the ban &mdash; for now, at least.</p>

<p><u>Are the days of plastic bags coming to an end?</u>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This fall, the General Assembly could still take action to limit bag bans. Philadelphia&rsquo;s lawsuit mostly centers on the moratorium&rsquo;s procedural tactics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With local plastics manufacturers and lobbyists representing the grocery industry still opposed to local bans, supporters in the General Assembly could potentially attempt to overcome their mistakes and find new ways to prevent limits on single-use plastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact that this is up for debate shows how backward-minded our state&rsquo;s plastics approach has become. Nationwide, <a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx"">a dozen states ban single-use plastic</a> at the state or county levels. Virginia state law specifically allows municipalities to issue fees on single-use plastic if local leaders so choose.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Cities move forward&nbsp;</u></p>

<p>In the meantime, local action to transition away from single-use plastics is gaining momentum.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The same day that the statewide moratorium expired, Philadelphia announced implementation of the city&rsquo;s single-use plastic bags ordinance would begin, <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/2020-12-30-updated-timeline-for-implementation-of-plastic-bag-ban"">with enforcement starting April 1.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Philadelphia&rsquo;s legislation prohibits retailers from using carryout or delivery plastic bags less than 2.25 mils thick. The city will also prevent use of paper bags that contain less than 40 percent recycled content.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh appears next in line. City Council <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/single-use-plastics-ban-cleared-for-pa-cities-as-pittsburgh-moves-to-eliminate-plastic-bags/Content?oid=19763862"">passed a resolution in May</a> saying that the city intends to pass a ban on single-use plastic bags in the near future.</p>

<p>With Pennsylvania&rsquo;s two largest cities taking action to eliminate plastic waste, other towns and cities are likely to follow their lead.</p>

<p><u>Environmental and financial benefits</u></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a moment to remember why getting rid of single-use plastics is a move in the right direction. Recent studies <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069618305291"">found plastic bag bans in other states</a> and cities resulted in significant reduction in plastic bag consumption &mdash; in some cases, a decrease of more than 70 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Benefits of switching from single-use plastic bags to reusable bags include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Less Litter: Plastic bags don&rsquo;t like to stay in one place. Wind-blown bags escape from trash bins, dump trucks and landfills to pollute our streets, parks, streams and rivers.&nbsp;Currently, the equivalent of <a href=""https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/the-new-plastics-economy-rethinking-the-future-of-plastics"">one dump truck of plastic litter enters our oceans</a> every day. Microplastics can hang in the air, <a href=""https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/04/a-shocking-discovery-shows-just-how-far-wind-can-carry-microplastics/"">perhaps traveling 100 miles or more downwind</a>. That&rsquo;s why even our most pristine places are getting covered in plastic trash.</li>
	<li>Cost Savings for Local Governments: In recent years, the value of recycled waste has declined, leaving municipalities with narrow operating margins when processing local waste. Single-use plastic offers no post-consumer value, making it even harder to be profitable when recycling. In fact, plastic bags can jam equipment at material recovery facilities, at times causing the entire recycling facility to shut down. Such work shortages <a href=""https://azdailysun.com/news/local/phoenix-recycling-officials-plastic-bags-contribute-to-lost-time-worth/article_7ec39600-c28f-5e4c-bb12-b3bb726e7ac9.html"">have cost cities millions of dollars.</a></li>
	<li>Reduction in Pollution: Plastics are manufactured <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/frackingandpetrochemicals"">using resource-intensive petrochemical processes</a> that require burning significant amounts of fossil fuel, contaminating local air and contributing to the climate crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Affordable Convenience: Consumers adopt new behaviors when their options change. To help with this transition, reusable or recyclable alternatives are widely available, affordable and practical. Free tote bags should continue to be handed out at public events. Local leaders can also allocate funds to programs that help to ensure fees on single-use plastic are not punitive on marginalized members of society. In cities like Washington, D.C., proceeds are spent on environmental remediation and education efforts that directly benefit members of the community.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure Pennsylvania does our part to address the growing challenge of plastic waste, PennFuture will continue to monitor the General Assembly and advocate for commonsense policies. Phasing out single-use plastics makes sense both environmentally and economically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But if those arguments fail, perhaps those who celebrate liberty should embrace the right for cities and towns to make their own decisions, including the choice of how they manage their own waste.</p>

Economic Impact Report Commissioned by Shell Doesn’t Tell the Whole Story. Far From It.,7/22/2021,"<p>A report released by researchers at Robert Morris University last week grabbed headlines across western Pennsylvania: once up and running next year, Royal Dutch Shell&rsquo;s massive plastics factory on the banks of the Ohio River in Beaver County will generate nearly $3.7 billion in economic activity annually in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these types of industry-funded sales pitches presented as &ldquo;studies&#39;&#39; are an effective tactic used by the fossil fuel industry <a href=""https://archive.triblive.com/business/local-stories/pennsylvania-tax-incentive-plan-played-major-role-in-luring-shell-cracker-plant/"">to gain taxpayer subsidies</a> and a license to pollute in exchange for promised economic development that may never materialize.</p>

<p>To that end, a high-ranking Shell official didn&rsquo;t miss the chance to spin this report to fit the company narrative: the fossil fuel giant is &ldquo;proud of the positive impact we are having on the local, regional and state economies,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.rmu.edu/about/news/rmu-study-shell-ethane-cracker-will-add-nearly-4-billion-each-year-pennsylvania-economy"">Senior Vice President Hillary Mercer said</a>, &ldquo;and we look forward to remaining a valued neighbor and employer of choice in the region for decades to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mercer mentioned the importance of being a &ldquo;valued neighbor&rdquo; in the community, but what does that mean? The RMU report contained nearly 10,000 words typed across 32 pages: the word &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; appeared 40 times, while &ldquo;billion&rdquo; appeared a total of 43 times. &ldquo;Pollution,&rdquo; &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;cancer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;health impacts&rdquo; appeared zero times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this industrial behemoth, which hopes to turn ethane into resins used to manufacture single-use plastics, could emit upward of 2.2 million tons of carbon pollution annually along with air toxics and other chemicals. Once operational, it will skyrocket near the top of the list of worst polluters in all of western Pennsylvania, but RMU report didn&rsquo;t assess, cite, or factor in the public health impacts of facilities like this, which history has shown have severe effects&mdash;one only needs to look at petrochemical hubs in Louisiana and Texas for present day proof. Not considering the very real costs that Pennsylvanians will suffer from the environmental and public health damages is a huge omission, but it&rsquo;s not the only problem with the report.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most glaring problem is the underlying assumption that this plant will actually be successful. The financial press <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/firms-like-dow-bet-billions-on-plastics-now-theres-a-glut-11602754200"">is already covering the glut in the industry</a> as production outstrips demand and long-time industry leaders like Dow and Chevron are scaling back investments. <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Financial-Risks_Weak-Outlook_Shell-PA-Petrochemical-Complex_June-2020.pdf"">As was reported last year</a>, Shell &ldquo;will enter the market amidst a plastics price war among formidable corporations with existing client bases that are reducing prices to maintain their position in a constricted market.&rdquo; In this environment, success is far from a sure thing.</p>

<p>The RMU report, for its part, cites &ldquo;Suttles, 2020&rdquo; and &ldquo;Esposito, 2018&rdquo; for the assumption that the plant will employ 600 full-time positions. Readers could be forgiven for assuming those are references to academic papers or some sort of independent analysis of the industry, but that is not the case: both are journalists quoting Shell&rsquo;s own estimations of employment. It&rsquo;s unclear if any of the claims regarding the future performance of this facility come from sources other than Shell or Shell-funded reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, when the authors list their final assumption&mdash;that there will be a market for the products of the proposed plant&mdash;there is no footnote at all giving a source.</p>

<p>To be fair, Shell does have one thing going for it that competitors like Dow, Chevron, and ExxonMobile don&rsquo;t&mdash;Pennsylvania is providing them the largest tax subsidy in the state&rsquo;s history, worth as much as $1.65 billion. This expenditure, along with the very real costs of the additional pollution including direct medical expenses, lost work, and environmental damage, don&rsquo;t appear on the other side of the ledger when Shell makes its lofty claims.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem for Shell&mdash;and the rest of us&mdash;is that these negative externalities are very real, and very costly. Negative externalities are industry-created costs that are incurred by society rather than the industry at fault, things such as air and water pollution, increased sickness and public health burdens, and contributing to a climate crisis that is already at a tipping point worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beaver County residents don&rsquo;t have to look far for <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/environment-energy/2021-07-18/puc-seeks-comment-on-1-million-fine-for-beaver-county-blast"">a blatant example of a negative externality</a>: in September 2018, the Revolution Pipeline exploded in Center Township, leveling one home, killing several animals, and destroying six high-voltage electricity transmission towers, among other damages. Another negative externality is <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2021/03/17/Falcon-Shell-ethane-pipeline-Pennsylvania-federal-investigation-whistleblowers/stories/202103160171"">the taxpayer money being spent by state and federal officials</a> on an investigation into Shell&rsquo;s Falcon pipeline, which will carry up to 107,000 barrels of ethane to the cracker plant daily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a report issued earlier this year <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">regarding fossil fuel subsidies</a>, PennFuture predicted at least $400 million in negative externalities in air pollution associated with Shell&rsquo;s plant alone, a number that did not factor in plastics pollution in nearby rivers and waterbodies. Considering the Shell plant will produce up to 1.6 million tons of plastic per year, the real cost of these negative externalities is likely much higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one thing for a company to commission a study about itself, and then use the results of that study in its massive public relations efforts. It&rsquo;s another thing entirely for any entity &mdash;be it academic, media, industry or otherwise&mdash;to study or publicize economic impacts without factoring in every negative externality that comes with a warming planet and changing climate. Any results of such a study should be rendered null and void.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, media outlets ran with the story, with some of them failing to mention that Shell paid for the study, let alone that the study did not factor in these negative externalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These kinds of studies serve one purpose, and one purpose only: to shift the narrative away from pollution, sickness and taxpayer subsidies, to one of economic impact, jobs and revitalization. It&rsquo;s an integral part of the industry&#39;s public relations machine that seeks to convince the public that America needs fossil fuels and extractive industry for prosperity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time we call this what it is: propaganda.&nbsp;</p>

New Report Details the Use of “Forever Chemicals” in Fracking Operations Despite Serious Concerns to Public Health,7/20/2021,"<p>The Physicians for Social Responsibility recently released a report titled <a href=""https://www.psr.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fracking-with-forever-chemicals.pdf"">&ldquo;Fracking with Forever Chemicals&rdquo;</a> which discusses the current findings and evidence of the use of PFAS in hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, for oil and gas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Put simply, these chemicals are very dangerous because they do not break down in the environment, accumulate in the body, and cause significant human health impacts that can result in severe illness and death. PFAS are found in soil and ground- and drinking-waters in multiple communities throughout the United States, including Pennsylvania, from any number of sources, and the inclusion of these forever toxic chemicals in fracking poses even more risk to our communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>What are PFAS and why are they harmful?</u></p>

<p>The per- and polyfluorinated substances, <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/pfas/basic-information-pfas"">known as PFAS</a>, are chemicals used to make coatings and products that resist heat, oil, stains, grease, and water. These coatings are used in products such as clothing, adhesives, furniture, food packaging, heat-resistant non-stick cooking surfaces, and the insulation of electrical wire. PFAS are also used in fire-fighting foams.&nbsp; The most studied PFAS chemicals are perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>PFAS are known as &ldquo;forever chemicals&rdquo; because they do not break down in the environment. They can move through a broad range of substances (solid, liquid, gas) and contaminate soils, surface and groundwater, and drinking water sources. Small doses of these chemicals build up in the human body and cause threatening chronic and toxic effects such as liver damage, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, hormone suppression, and cancer, especially in children. For more health effects, <a href=""https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/index.html"">see the fact sheet here.</a></p>

<p>Not only do small amounts of these highly toxic forever chemicals threaten our health, but the ubiquitous nature of these chemicals increases the threat exponentially. CDC scientists found groups of PFAS in all people tested for it, showing a widespread effect of these chemicals in the US population. <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/"">See the study here</a>. Furthermore, PFAS have been found in drinking water supplies, rivers, lakes, soils, and fish and other wildlife and livestock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But shockingly, at this time, PFAS is not a regulated contaminant either by EPA or Pennsylvania. EPA is currently in the process of listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the federal Safe Water Drinking Act (and hopefully other federal environmental statutes) and setting a &ldquo;maximum contaminant level&rdquo; (MCL), but its current health advisory guidelines are just that &ndash; guidelines. PA&rsquo;s process for setting an MCL is dragging along as well, leaving our communities without little to no protections from the toxic forever chemicals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>PFAS in fracking &ndash; Worse than we thought</u></p>

<p>We know that, despite ongoing evidence of contamination and impacts to local residents and livestock, the fracking industry has long opposed any attempts to require the disclosure of the toxic mix of chemicals used in their operations, citing proprietary business information claims.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This report demonstrates that fracking operations (including well drilling) include the injection of these dangerous forever chemicals through the ground and drinking water and that PFAS can also make it into wastewater produced by fracking. The report discusses that oil and gas companies, including many big companies that have fracked in PA, have used PFAS or substances that can degrade into PFAS in hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas in more than 1,200 wells in six U.S. states between 2012 and 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mentioned, these companies refused to identify chemicals they were using for fracking and instead treat these chemicals as &ldquo;trade secrets&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary information.&rdquo; And this is extremely concerning as the report points out: &ldquo;The lack of full disclosure of chemicals used in oil and gas operations raises the potential that PFAS could have been used even more extensively than records indicate, both geographically and in other stages of the oil and gas extraction process, such as drilling, that precede the underground injections known as fracking.&rdquo; Refusal by fracking companies to disclose the myriad toxic and harmful chemicals they use also makes these chemicals almost impossible to study and to find the right medical treatments for those affected by it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The impacts to our communities from fracking is no secret (although the chemicals they use remain so), but the inclusion of PFAS in the mix is even worse than we thought.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<u>Fracking with PFAS in Pennsylvania</u></p>

<p>Fracking has been occurring in Pennsylvania since the technology exploded in 2008. The Marcellus Shale covers much of Pennsylvania and is regulated primarily by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Pennsylvania is currently in the number two spot among gas-producing states in the US, thereby leading many Pennsylvanians to be exposed to fracking operations and these toxic forever chemicals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2020, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Attorney General issued a report based on a criminal grand jury investigation of oil and gas drilling pollution showing that those living in close proximity to a well pad became chronically and unexplainably ill, especially children that are susceptible to these effects. Also, pets died and farm animals started miscarrying or giving birth to deformed animals. It is suggested that the use of PFAS in fracking is heavily related to this and if these chemicals were found in those six states mentioned in the report, it is highly likely PFAS are used by the fracking companies in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are many communities that are significantly impacted by fracking in PA, particularly in Washington and Westmoreland County which contain the most fracking wells that resulted in multiple health problems, from nosebleeds to cancer. There are towns in Pennsylvania that have been ruined by fracking. Take for example Dimock, where it was found that heavy concentrations of methane contaminated the drinking water of several dozen families as a result of Cabot Oil and Gas&rsquo; drilling practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is important to note that the use of PFAS is not only dangerous for those living by the well pads, where they are injected into the ground, but is also likely to contaminate our environment and poison our communities through the treatment and disposal of fracking wastewater.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We hope this knowledge will be enough to help move the needle on the regulation of not only fracking water and wastewater, but also of PFAS themselves.</p>

<p>One example of where this will likely come up sooner than later is with the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC). The DRBC <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fracking-Banned-in-Delaware-River-Basin"">recently banned fracking within the watershed</a>, and in September, the Commission will consider whether to allow the treatment of fracking wastewater in the basin. Previously, the DRBC withdrew its proposed regulations on transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of fracking wastewater within the Basin, along with its proposed regulations on allowing Delaware River Basin water to be exported outside of the basin to be used in fracking operations, arguably because they were not protective of the basin&rsquo;s water quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This report further shows that DRBC should also ban the treatment of wastewater within the watershed given the high threat of PFAS and other toxic contamination. The wastewater produced by fracking contains the chemicals used in drilling and fracking fluids. It is almost certain that PFAS substances may be in the wastewater produced by fracked wells. PennFuture will continue to push DRBC &ndash; and others &ndash; to fully protect our waters, lands, and communities from the dangers of fracking in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, there is currently legislation being drafted and proposed in response to the Pennsylvania Attorney Generals Grand Jury report on fracking. Bills have been introduced already that aim to increase setback requirements and give our Attorney General more enforcement power. We anticipate that such legislation will also include a chemical disclosure requirement, as recommended by the Grand Jury, and we hope that the General Assembly will also consider banning fracking companies from using these toxic forever chemicals in the fracking process.&nbsp;</p>

Supreme Court Ruled Natural Gas Companies Can Condemn State-Owned Land,7/15/2021,"<p>The U.S. Supreme Court recently dealt a severe blow <a href=""https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/land-environment/2021/07/04/penneast-pipeline-supreme-court-decision-opponents/7819506002/"">in an ongoing fight to prevent PennEast</a>, a private natural gas company, from building a 116 mile natural gas pipeline from the Marcellus Shale region in Pennsylvania into New Jersey.</p>

<p>The proposed pipeline is planned to start in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, and end in Mercer County, New Jersey. In a divided 5-4 opinion, the Court overturned the 3rd Circuit&rsquo;s decision <a href=""https://ballotpedia.org/PennEast_Pipeline_Co._v._New_Jersey"">and held that PennEast has the authority</a> to condemn land owned by the State of New Jersey for the purposes of building the pipeline under the Natural Gas Act.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authority derives from a certificate issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to PennEast essentially certifying that the construction of the pipeline is a public convenience and necessity. Section 717f(h) of the Natural Gas Act <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/717f"">authorizes holders of this FERC certificate to exercise the power</a> of federal eminent domain to condemn any private or State owned right-of-way required to build the &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; pipelines if they cannot secure the right-of-way through contract and negotiated compensation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issues argued in the 3rd Circuit and the Supreme Court turned on complicated constitutional questions of state sovereign immunity. According to the Supreme Court, condemnation proceedings by PennEast against New Jersey do not violate state sovereign immunity because the states consented to federal eminent domain power (including condemnation proceedings) when they ratified the Constitution, and long established precedent allows the Federal Government to delegate this power to private parties. In reaching this decision, Chief Justice Roberts references the &ldquo;humble beginnings&rdquo; of the Nation&rsquo;s interstate pipeline system in central Indiana, and its development into a system spanning hundreds of thousands of miles thanks to Section 717f(h) of the Natural Gas Act.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennEast seeks to condemn 131 properties in New Jersey. The state of New Jersey has an ownership interest in forty-two of these properties, including many which are preserved for open space, conservation, or farmland. Additionally, the pipeline is planned to cross <a href=""https://www.njspotlight.com/2021/06/us-supreme-court-ruling-controversial-penneast-pipeline-state-of-nj-environmentalists-disappointed/"">at least 31 streams designated as &ldquo;Category One&rdquo;</a> by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection that meet drinking water needs and provide critical habitat to wildlife.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Habitat and clean drinking water degradation aside, the $1 billion dollar investment is a step backwards in achieving the country&rsquo;s goal <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/"">of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050</a>. Stranger still, a financial supporter of the PennEast pipeline, South Jersey Industries (SJI), <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/penneast-pipeline-south-jersey-industries-emissions-20210519.html"">has recently announced that it plans</a> to be carbon neutral by 2040. Realistically speaking, the global consensus on the threat of climate change and the strengthened focus on renewable, clean energy is influencing future energy markets and demand. No amount of job creation or greenwashing by its financial backers will change the fact that the PennEast pipeline will be competing in a market faced with a decreasing demand for natural gas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an effort to continue to move forward at all costs, PennEast decided to <a href=""https://penneastpipeline.com/penneast-files-new-phased-approach-with-federal-regulators-to-meet-growing-customer-demand/"">break the pipeline project into two phases</a> after regulatory and legal delays so that it could begin building in the areas where it has already gained approval, despite the fact that a number of permits and approvals are still outstanding. Phase 1 would be 68 miles and begin from the Marcellus Shale region in Pennsylvania into Bethlehem Township. Phase 2 would continue through Bucks County and across the Delaware River ending in Mercer County, New Jersey. PennFuture <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PennEast-Chs.-102---105-Comments-Jan.-2021-.pdf"">has previously argued</a> that PennEast, especially in this new phased approach, is a pipeline to nowhere, and that allowing for the construction of the pipeline at this time would result in permanent and unnecessary degradation of our lands and waters.</p>

<p>However, the fight is not over yet. Resistance against the pipeline&rsquo;s construction has been on-going for seven years and there is still pending litigation. There are challenges related to FERC&rsquo;s issuance of the certificate of public necessity that were stayed while the Supreme Court evaluated the case, and they will resume now. PennEast also needs to obtain several permits from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Delaware River Basin Commission, and both the Pennsylvania and New Jersey DEPs to go forward with the project. The Pennsylvania DEP <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/ProgramIntegration/Pennsylvania-Pipeline-Portal/Pages/PennEast.aspx"">provides information on the pipeline status</a> in Pennsylvania, including all of the application and permit materials and information on past and upcoming public hearings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The DEP has not yet approved the required Chapter 102 (Erosion and Sediment Control) and Chapter 105 (Dam Safety and Waterway Management) permits for the Phase 1 portion of the proposed pipeline, and we continue to oppose this destructive and unnecessary pipeline in PA.

"Report highlights success of Philadelphia’s Green City, Clean Waters Program",7/13/2021,"<p>Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is approaching a major milestone in Philadelphia. This year marks 10 years since the City of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Water Department embarked on its groundbreaking effort to improve water quality through the implementation of GSI with its Green City, Clean Waters program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent report <a href=""https://www.sbnphiladelphia.org/recent_coverage/sbn-releases-report-on-ten-years-of-gsis-impact-in-pa-and-why-its-a-crucial-tool-for-economic-recovery-and-growth/"">from our partners at Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia (SBN)</a> confirms that the city&rsquo;s original vision for cleaner water in Philadelphia has been hugely successful and the continued development of the GSI industry across Pennsylvania can serve as a driver of positive economic, social, and environmental change. At a time when Pennsylvania&rsquo;s coffers are flush with revenue, the SBN report makes a compelling case for increased support for greener watershed stormwater management from Harrisburg.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: there is a great deal of uncertainty at the moment. For the second time in 15 years, we experienced a &ldquo;once-in-a-lifetime&rdquo; economic catastrophe. The global pandemic responsible for this catastrophe has now claimed four million lives worldwide. Simultaneously, Americans are grappling with centuries of racial injustice and the increasingly worrisome impact of climate change. As the report says: &ldquo;While the combination of these crises can feel overwhelming, they also present a unique opportunity to recognize their interdependence and embrace a holistic approach to problem-solving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Increased investment in green space through GSI will allow Pennsylvania to create jobs, address historical inequities in our Black and Brown communities, and help all Pennsylvanians better deal with the ramifications from a climate that is growing hotter and wetter. GSI utilizes nature-based solutions like rain gardens, green roofs, and tree trenches, to manage polluted stormwater runoff. It is a cleaner and cheaper method to ensure that we have cleaner water while also providing significant benefits to the surrounding communities.</p>

<p>According to the SBN report, there are currently 34,000 GSI workers in Pennsylvania. From 2011 to 2019, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s GSI industry grew at a staggering rate of 9.2 percent. Pennsylvania saw 6.3 percent growth across all occupations statewide during that time. Philadelphia, alone, has seen its local GSI industry grow by 13.3 percent, adding 1,200 jobs from 2011-2019. The report also makes clear that these are life-sustaining jobs for all Pennsylvanians regardless of educational background or access to professional training:</p>

<ol>
	<li>&nbsp;One&nbsp;in two&nbsp;GSI industry workers earn more than $15/hour.</li>
	<li>The median annual wage for a high school graduate is $47,120.</li>
	<li>More than half of GSI jobs require a high school diploma or less.</li>
	<li>More than 40 percent of jobs pay more than $55,000 per year.</li>
</ol>

<p>Jobs in the GSI industry provide a legitimate pathway to life-sustaining careers for Pennsylvanians who are most in need of viable solutions to support themselves and their families. Most importantly, these jobs are readily available to the local communities where projects are implemented. In Philadelphia, the Green City, Clean Waters plan is estimated to support 1,160 jobs per year in a city that consistently struggles with high unemployment in Black and Brown neighborhoods due to historic exclusion from equitable opportunities in education and professional training. Emphasizing workforce development, diversity, and inclusion within the GSI industry will help provide equitable economic opportunity to these communities.</p>

<p>These same communities have also suffered the effects of historically racist practices like redlining. Beginning in the 1930s, redlining was a practice developed by the federal government and financial industry to promote investment and development in areas that were largely white while simultaneously disinvesting in communities of color. The impact from this practice is still being felt today. Research has confirmed that <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/30/opinion/environmental-inequity-trees-critical-infrastructure.html"">the lack of green space in communities of color directly correlates</a> to redlining and has contributed to the urban heat island effect in cities like Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The urban heat island effect leads to hotter temperatures in urban areas with less access to green space. Fortunately, we have a natural resource to help reduce temperatures: trees. Trees <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/climate/trees-cities-heat-waves.html"">substantially reduce air temperatures</a> in city neighborhoods and improve air quality. As the SBN report details, 70 percent of low-income communities live in nature-deprived areas and are more vulnerable to extreme heat. People of color are three times more likely to live in a nature-deprived area. Investing in GSI will add green space in these areas and help reverse the heat island effect and the racist practices that allowed it to develop over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best part about investing heavily in GSI is that we know that investing in infrastructure is a proven method to help the economy recover from a severe recession. According to the report, every dollar invested in infrastructure during the recovery from the Great Recession resulted in a 1.5x return in GDP growth. The report states: &ldquo;Because infrastructure projects often last three years, they are an effective strategy to mitigate economic fallout in the short term. In addition, because planning and design, construction, and ongoing operations and maintenance are key elements of successful GSI projects, investments in GSI also position the Commonwealth for long-term economic benefits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the economic, social, and environmental benefits provided by GSI and the desperate need to upgrade and repair Pennsylvania&rsquo;s aging stormwater management infrastructure, there is a significant funding gap to make the necessary upgrades and repairs to meet regulatory requirements. SBN notes that available funding over the next 10 years amounts to $900 million. Pennsylvania needs an additional $8.4 billion to fund the work that must be done to update its stormwater management infrastructure.</p>

<p>Here is what we know:</p>

<ol>
	<li>&nbsp;Pennsylvania&rsquo;s stormwater management infrastructure is in dire need of upgrade and repair.</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy requires significant investment to ensure a robust and equitable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related recession.</li>
	<li>The world is growing hotter and wetter due to climate change, which increases our need to protect our waterways from polluted runoff.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;To paraphrase <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/5C41iVpK8HXCe3qlLL3I38"">a Pennsylvania native</a>, we need trees to come back stronger than a &lsquo;90s trend to help us reduce temperatures.</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania is one of the leaders in GSI industry and can do more to ensure we keep leading in this critical field.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are recommendations from the SBN report for the Pennsylvania General Assembly to promote investment in GSI:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Restore funding for PA Act 167 and otherwise fund municipal stormwater management planning and implementation.</li>
	<li>Increase funding through Clean Water State Revolving Fund grants and other low- to no-cost financing for public GSI projects, with guidelines that prioritize nature-based solutions and investments in vulnerable and underserved communities.</li>
	<li>Expand grants, low- to no-cost financing, and other incentives to promote GSI investments on private property.</li>
</ol>

<p>The model for success with GSI has been proven in Philadelphia and across the Commonwealth. The time is now to fully fund this critical component of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s cleaner and greener future.</p>

"More than Skin-Deep: Environmental Racism, Justice, and Pennsylvania",7/7/2021,"<p>We are a year out from the wave of protests, marches, sit-ins, phone and text banking, and multifaceted advocacy that shaped the Summer 2020. People began to question whole systems, political, social, and economic alike: why did, in the Land of Opportunity, the poor become poorer, the rich richer; Black and brown people keep dying from situations others individuals would not? Are there links between race and class, does the white, Black, and brown working class have more in common than meets the eye, and what does this mean for environmental advocacy?</p>

<p>Article 1, Section 27 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania states that &ldquo;[t]he people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania&#39;s public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come.&rdquo; Yet, the conditions on the ground show that not all groups have the same access to clean air or pure water.</p>

<p>Environmental Racism as a concept has its roots in the 1970s and 1980s, but its earliest usage as a term was by pastor and Civil Rights champion Dr. Benjamin Chavis. Dr. Chavis defined &ldquo;environmental racism&rdquo; as <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/what-is-environmental-racism-pollution-covid-systemic/"">&ldquo;racial discrimination in environmental policy-making</a>, the enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of colour for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities, and the history of excluding people of colour from leadership of the ecology movements.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href=""https://qz.com/1226984/environmental-racism-has-left-black-americans-three-times-more-likely-to-die-from-pollution/"">Nationwide</a>, Black Americans are <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1702747"">three times more likely to die</a> from exposure to air pollutants than their white counterparts. <a href=""https://www.colorlines.com/articles/study-pennsylvanias-communities-color-more-danger-health-consequences-fracking"">In Pennsylvania specifically</a>, people of color are 39 percent of the population living within three miles of existing and proposed air polluting coal and fossil fuel power plants, while only composing 22 percent of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s total population. In addition, the poverty rate is 60 percent higher within three miles of the plants compared to the rest of the state. It is clear that people of minority groups are facing the brunt of environmental degradation at a harsher rate than other groups.</p>

<p>Looking at a more local level, specifically in Western Pennsylvania, the race and ethnic disparities in access to clean air and water persist. In Allegheny County, <a href=""https://www.ehn.org/environmental-injustice-pittsburgh-air-pollution-2646169635.html"">Environmental Health News</a> and the <a href=""https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-020-00584-z""><em>Environmental Health</em></a> journal show <a href=""https://www.ehn.org/pittsburgh-air-pollution-unsafe-2644931105.html"">air pollution levels vary widely</a> between neighborhoods, with the County region&#39;s most polluted census tracts being found in poor and minority neighborhoods, while the census tracts with the cleanest air tend to be in wealthier and whiter neighborhoods. The same data also showed higher rates of air pollution-related deaths from coronary heart disease in poor and minority neighborhoods. The story is the same <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/new-report-finds-lead-in-majority-of-allegheny-county-water-systems-offers-strategies-to-reduce-exposure/Content?oid=19373592"">when it comes to water</a> in the County. Higher levels of lead exposure also correlated with rates of poverty of non-white populations.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh City Paper highlights the <a href=""https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Environmental%20Health/2018%20Childhood%20Lead%20Surveillance%20Annual%20Report.pdf"">Pennsylvania Department of Health&rsquo;s 2018 Childhood Lead Surveillance Annual Report</a> that found that non-Hispanic Black children and Hispanic children were 3.8 times more likely to have confirmed elevated lead blood levels relative to their non-Hispanic white counterparts in Allegheny County. And these same trends of disproportionate pollution burdens being heaped on poorer communities and communities of color <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/09/24/JAMA-Network-Open-UPMC-study-air-pollution-pm25-particulates-linked-strokes-Afib-heart/stories/202009230137"">extends throughout Pennsylvania</a>. This is indeed Environmental Racism in action: poorer, darker folks are left to suffer the worst that bad environmental policy has to offer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is it simply that Black and brown populations face the brunt of environmental degradation due to race alone? Many, including myself, would say no -- income and class plays a role that impacts some white populations and further compounds the weight of the effects on those of minority races and ethnicities.</p>

<p>As defined by the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/learn-about-environmental-justice"">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>, Environmental Justice (EJ) is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies.</p>

<p>The reality is, however, that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s heavily white, rural, lower-income communities are, too, facing harsh impacts from environmental degradation, specifically by the fracked gas industry. Fracking wells in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Marcellus Shale region <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/poor-communities-bear-greatest-burden-from-fracking/"">are disproportionately located in poor rural communities</a>, which bear much of the weight of associated pollution. Heavily-fracked communities <a href=""https://www.ehn.org/fracking-pennsylvania-deaths-2646154025.html"">face higher rates of numerous health effects</a> including preterm births, high-risk pregnancies, asthma, and cardiovascular disease, with Western PA&rsquo;s own Washington County facing the highest number of direct deaths from fracking-based air pollution in the entire Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some policymakers in Pennsylvania have been welcoming the industry with open arms and open pocketbooks in the form of tax subsidies (<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Publication-Buried-Out-of-Sight-Uncovering-Pennsylvanias-Hidden-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies"">see PennFuture&rsquo;s latest report</a>). State legislators know of the <a href=""https://www.alleghenyfront.org/petrochemical-town-hall-near-pittsburgh-spotlights-pollution-health-worries/"">harmful effects that this industry brings</a> to the air and water quality of their own constituents, yet <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2021/04/22/the-house-environment-committee-chair-dismisses-climate-science-what-does-that-mean-for-climate-action-in-pa/"">continue to ignore calls to stop working</a> with this harmful and dying industry and lie directly to the very people who elected them.</p>

<p>Moving forward, we should highlight the work of people who live in our state fighting towards a more equitable approach to environmental justice. We need to actively and loudly push back on policymakers deliberately standing in the way of progress on the environmental equity front. We need to continue to educate our friends and neighbors on a better energy and labor alternative to fracking, petrochemical, and other environmentally degrading industries. We should lend an open ear to green job makers nationwide and even internationally, and <a href=""https://reimagineappalachia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ReImagine-Appalachia_PeriBrief_PA_Jan2021.pdf"">prioritize family-sustaining, green jobs</a> over dirty and dying industries.</p>

<p>Environmental Racism is, indeed, more than skin-deep, as income and class clearly further heighten the impact. Fighting Environmental Racism is integral to the larger idea of Environmental Justice. The problems being faced by our largely-white, rural neighbors are not that much different than that of a Black family in the City of Pittsburgh. Both are being taken advantage of by petrochemical and other dirty manufacturing corporate neighbors that are doing anything but being &ldquo;neighborly.&rdquo; It is through unity and solidarity between the workers, I believe, that we will be able to breathe free, drink free, and live free.&nbsp;</p>

"Instead of Taxing Electric Vehicles, Pennsylvania Should Focus on Growing the Industry",7/6/2021,"<p>Pennsylvania has a reputation for the poor condition of our roads and bridges.&nbsp;In fact, when the American Society of Civil Engineers released their <a href=""https://infrastructurereportcard.org/state-item/pennsylvania/"">2018 Infrastructure Report Card</a>, it noted that because of the 2,600 transportation projects made possible with Act 89 funding, our grade for roads improved to a D+. Hardly a ringing endorsement, and our bridges had the same low score as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just keeping the status quo will take larger and larger investments in infrastructure&mdash;improving conditions will cost even more&mdash;and our funding model is strained.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.penndot.gov/about-us/funding/Pages/default.aspx"">According to PennDOT</a>, 74% of infrastructure funding comes from gas taxes, 17% comes from vehicle fees, and 9% comes from the general fund, but current revenue still leaves us billions of dollars short of meeting our needs. Worse yet, the heavy reliance on gas taxes has some significant structural problems.</p>

<p>On the surface, having people pay for the infrastructure in proportion to their use sounds like a fair arrangement, but with vehicles becoming more efficient and more automakers announcing plans to phase out fossil fuels entirely, gas purchases are an increasingly poor indicator of road usage, and relying on gas taxes simply isn&rsquo;t sustainable.&nbsp;This has put alternatives like electric vehicles (EVs) <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063734865"">in the sights of many policy makers.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Governor Wolf appears to be taking a more methodical approach, creating a <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-commits-to-phasing-out-gas-tax-announces-commission-to-develop-funding-solutions/"">Transportation Revenue Options Commission</a> to make funding recommendations.&nbsp;Other lawmakers aren&rsquo;t stopping to consider the alternatives and are proposing EV owners pay high&mdash;and sometimes punitive&mdash;fees.</p>

<p><u>Fairness and equity is a challenging problem</u></p>

<p>In reality, being fair is a complicated problem that goes beyond EVs, and just charging EV owners high fees isn&rsquo;t the solution. The assumption that more gas purchases equates to more vehicle miles of travel (VMT) may seem fair on the surface, but it has its own problems.&nbsp;Fuel economy for new vehicles <a href=""https://www.bts.gov/content/average-fuel-efficiency-us-passenger-cars-and-light-trucks"">has been steadily increasing</a> long before hybrids and EVs became available.&nbsp;That means when someone buys a new car, there is a good chance they will be buying less gas and paying less tax per mile than the person who ends up driving the vehicle they traded-in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This, along with many other factors such as the increasing distance between affordable housing and jobs, creates a system in the United States where, <a href=""https://www.itdp.org/2019/05/23/high-cost-transportation-united-states/#:~:text=The%20lowest%20income%20is%20burdened,(lack%20of)%20transport%20system."">unlike much of Europe</a>, the lower your income bracket the higher percentage of your income you will spend on transportation. As the author James Baldwin once noted, &ldquo;anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although regressive taxes like our gas tax create significant equity issues, the ability of many drivers to give themself a tax cut by buying a more efficient car, carpooling, or otherwise driving less is a real benefit.&nbsp;Economists say <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-5/using-gasoline-data-to-explain-inelasticity.htm"">gas prices are relatively inelastic</a> and people don&rsquo;t change their behavior all that much until gas prices get very high, but people still like having the power to choose.</p>

<p>There is another less obvious benefit from at-the-pump taxes:&nbsp; we likely receive a significant amount of tax dollars every year from out-of-state drivers who stop and fill their tanks in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; For interstate trucking we have a system called the <a href=""https://www.revenue.pa.gov/FormsandPublications/FormsforBusinesses/MAFT/MCRT-IFTA/Documents/dmf-105.pdf"">International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA)</a> that attempts to more fairly apportion tax dollars based on where the vehicles are used instead of where the fuel is purchased, but there is no equivalent for personal vehicles.&nbsp; If we don&rsquo;t get the revenue out-of-state drivers are paying in gas taxes, we&rsquo;ll need to backfill that with additional revenue from other sources.&nbsp; It should be no surprise that most lawmakers would rather a tax be paid by non-resident drivers than their constituents.</p>

<p><u>Fairly Addressing the EV issue</u></p>

<p>Pennsylvania already attempted to address the issue of EVs not contributing to road use.&nbsp;Our current law includes an <a href=""https://www.revenue.pa.gov/TaxLawPoliciesBulletinsNotices/TaxBulletins/MAFT/Documents/mft_bulletin_2012-01.pdf"">Alternative Fuels Tax (AFT)</a> for vehicles that don&rsquo;t run on gas or diesel.&nbsp; The tax rate depends on the power source of the vehicle&mdash;for EVs it&rsquo;s currently $0.0172 per kilowatt-hour.&nbsp; That works out to $0.5744 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE).&nbsp; Very close to the 2021 liquid fuels tax of&nbsp; $0.576 per gallon of gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a perfect solution since someone with a hybrid, or any car with better than average gas mileage, will still pay less per mile than someone driving an older, less efficient vehicle.&nbsp; Businesses will also pay more in net taxes per mile on electric vehicles since they are charged 6% sales tax on the electricity that isn&rsquo;t charged on gasoline or diesel fuel.&nbsp; But, there is a larger problem with this system: relatively few people file the required reports and actually pay the tax.&nbsp; A more systematic approach to collecting the tax is possible, but any proposal to do this is going to create new expenses in recordkeeping, managing data, and of course enforcement.</p>

<p>As an alternative, we could skip a lot of recordkeeping and data management by charging EV owners a flat fee, but this raises the question of what amount is fair.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy to calculate that a new car driving around 10,000 miles per year at an average of 37mpg will generate about $155 in gas taxes, but does that make charging all new EV owners a fee of $155 fair?&nbsp; A flat fee like this means that the proverbial grandma who only drives to church on Sunday would be paying the same as someone with an hour-long commute every day.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d also be missing out on fees from out-of-state drivers entirely.</p>

<p>Fairness should also consider more than just who is paying for roads.&nbsp;Driving an EV 10,000 miles per year in Pennsylvania could save around three tons of carbon pollution, along with cutting emissions of air toxics and smog-causing volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen. The economic value of <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-12/documents/social_cost_of_carbon_fact_sheet.pdf"">cutting carbon pollution and other emissions</a> could easily exceed the otherwise &ldquo;fair&rdquo; $155 fee.&nbsp;Of course, we need to get revenue from somewhere if we are going to maintain our roads and bridges&mdash;for now, actually charging polluters for the cost of their pollution would be a good start.</p>

<p>Even if we ultimately conclude EVs drivers are going to need to pay more at some point, there is no particular rush to tax them today.&nbsp; EVs only represented about <a href=""https://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/DVSPubsForms/BMV/Registration%20Reports/ReportofRegistrations2020.pdf"">one tenth of one percent of the vehicles registered</a> in Pennsylvania in 2020, and these are mostly smaller and lighter vehicles, so the impact on our roads and the actual lost revenue is comparatively small.</p>

<p>Granted, the number of EVs <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/StateEnergyProgram/PAEVRoadmap.pdf"">is expected to grow substantially in the coming years</a>, but that brings additional opportunities for economic growth in sustainable industries that we should be encouraging.&nbsp; Utilities and electrical workers improving our distribution network and expanding charging stations will be an important sector, but parts, maintenance, and supporting technologies for the new vehicles will bring opportunities as well.</p>

<p>When computers and the Internet were relatively new, Pennsylvania offered tax moratoriums to help sales grow.&nbsp; With that growth in sales, businesses specializing in technology grew as well and they are now <a href=""https://www.workstats.dli.pa.gov/Documents/PA%20Industry%20Clusters/BSV%204-Pager.pdf"">a key part of our business services industry.</a>&nbsp;EV and EV service industries could be the next success story in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Rather than taxing EVs, hindering a promising developing industry, maybe we should focus on growing sustainable industries first.</p>

Show Your Support for Our Delaware River Fish Protection Petition!,7/1/2021,"<p>Earlier this year, PennFuture and our partners submitted <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PR_DRBC.Petition_3.3.2021.pdf"">a supplemental petition</a> to the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) seeking immediate upgrade of the designated use of a portion of the mainstem Delaware River to protect fish and aquatic life, especially Atlantic sturgeon. The purpose of the Delaware River Fish Protection Petition is to upgrade the designated uses of Zone 3, Zone 4, and a portion of Zone 5 of the Delaware River to include and protect the existing aquatic life uses.</p>

<p>Based on the evidence, the current existing use is the &ldquo;maintenance and propagation of resident fish and other aquatic life&rdquo; and &ldquo;spawning and nursery habitat for migratory fish.&rdquo; These are technical terms under the applicable clean water regulations that recognize and require a certain higher level of water quality to protect these uses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The federal Clean Water Act states that the designated use should match the existing&nbsp; vuse. Designated uses describe the attainable condition and are regulations promulgated through a rulemaking process. Existing uses describe the current condition of a water body. If designated use does not match the current existing use in the Delaware River, it could lead to harm to aquatic life and the surrounding communities. (For a bit more on designated and existing uses in Pennsylvania, <a href=""https://youtu.be/DBWr4aFUvgM"">check out this Our Pocono Waters video.</a>)&nbsp; For additional background on the history of dissolved oxygen in the urban stretches of the Delaware River and the legal requirements surrounding designated uses in the River, please take a look at this webinar.</p>

<p>In 2013, Delaware River Keeper Network and other associations submitted an initial petition to the DRBC, urging it to recognize the emerging data that fish are now spawning in all zones of the Delaware Estuary. The Delaware River&rsquo;s genetically unique population of Atlantic sturgeon is also on the brink of extinction. Every summer, there is a decrease in dissolved oxygen levels, leading to reproductive failures for the fish in the river and will lead to extinction <a href=""https://www.nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/Review_DOreq_KeySensSpecies_DelEstuary_ANStoDRBCnov2018.pdf"">as indicated by a 2018 DRBC report</a>.</p>

<p>Dissolved oxygen is the amount of oxygen that is present in the water and therefore available for fish. Oxygen dissolves by diffusion from the surrounding air; aeration of water that has tumbled over falls and rapids; and as a waste product of photosynthesis. Fish and aquatic animals cannot split oxygen from water or other oxygen-containing compounds, making dissolved oxygen vital for their survival. Furthermore, there was a decrease in dissolved oxygen as indicated by both the Chester and Ben Franklin sensor, showing a lack of updated protections to prevent backsliding and lethal conditions from occurring in the Delaware River.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Accomplishing the upgrade of the designated use to match the existing use will provide incredible economic benefits that potentially exceed $1 billion and improve the surrounding communities. In a recent study, the restoration of dissolved oxygen in the Delaware River <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/DRN Keylog - Economic Value of DO Restoration in the DE %282020-12%29.pdf"">was modeled to predict water quality</a> and ecological improvements that directly and indirectly benefit the region&rsquo;s economy.</p>

<p>Even though many of the recognized benefits could not be translated to economic valuation, it forecasted benefits ranging from $40 million to $60 million annually, and total benefits approaching $1 billion for local economies. Next, poorer communities around the Delaware River will enjoy better water quality after having to endure degraded water quality and failure of the basic implementation of Clean Water Act protections on the tidal river.&nbsp; Other examples of observed improvements are the return of recreational watersports; and both the restoration of striped bass and American shad fisheries around the river.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more about these economic benefits, <a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__youtu.be_y-2DgmhZSnwYk&amp;d=DwQGAg&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=J7VSoqYCG5L5ntGWm-Av1zYjsSNjNMFGZWrVV4FWpr0&amp;m=wj6lma6kO4MNOCz7aVHPgFZnGPvMKeKAarJ9qbA4Tuc&amp;s=NU4mTf3q43NLXb2D_IJmKmTLecch8ioZVjK85fM2LSY&amp;e="">this webinar focuses on the recent economic study</a> and details regarding potential economic benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are excited about this opportunity to protect the fish of the Delaware, improve the water quality protections in and around Philadelphia, and ensure that the existing uses for the entire Delaware River mainstem are protected.&nbsp;But we need your help!&nbsp;</p>

Introducing PennFuture's Legal Interns,6/30/2021,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past 20 years, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognized that we need to be more involved with cultivating the legal talent that will continue to support our mission. Our attorneys have a long history of mentoring legal interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor law students interested in making a difference for our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting the State as well as to further their potential careers in environmental law. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.</p>

<p>This summer, we have a fantastic group of law students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We&rsquo;ve asked our summer legal interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</p>

<p><u><strong>Emily Rollins is a rising third-year law student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.&nbsp;</strong></u></p>

<p>I decided to go to law school because I wanted to pursue environmental law. I have always been interested in shaping a career around the interaction of humans and our natural environment, and&nbsp;<img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Emily.jpg"" style=""width: 125px; height: 188px; float: right;"" /> fighting for environmental justice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to law school, I was working as an affiliate with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association at the Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center in Honolulu doing work related to fisheries economics. I received my B.S. and B.A. in environmental resource economics and French at the University of Nevada, Reno, and my M.Sc. in food, agriculture, and resource economics from the University of Guelph. While I very much enjoyed my work, I decided to go to law school because I wanted to play a more direct role in addressing environmental and social issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I first became interested in PennFuture in 2020 when I read about their successful lawsuit against the EPA for its failure to regulate coke ovens. I am particularly interested in climate change and air quality issues and am very excited to be interning with PennFuture this summer!</p>

<p><u><strong>Austin Grace is a rising third-year law student at Widener Commonwealth School of Law.</strong></u></p>

<p>For the longest time, I thought about becoming an attorney since I was a child, but I was unsure about the kind of attorney I wanted to be. I was deciding whether I wanted to pursue a Ph.D in Environment and Ecology or obtain my J.D while I was working on a few research projects, but at the end of the day I decided to enter the legal field after long thought and consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I attended Moravian College and worked as a summer researcher for their SOAR Program in 2018. My research involved conducting a biodiversity assessment at the Lehigh Gap Nature Center&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Austin.JPG"" style=""width: 150px; height: 200px; float: right;"" /> (LGNC) that involved collecting, identifying, and categorizing arachnids, along with storing them for future research on how the zinc contamination affected arachnid populations. During my time at LGNC, I saw first hand the devastation that the New Jersey Zinc Company caused to its mountains and rivers when they were in operation in the 1900&rsquo;s. To this very day, LGNC is still making efforts&nbsp;&nbsp;to restore the area. Working on the mountain sides at LGNC ignited a passion in me to protect species and the water quality. After completion of the project, I decided to set my sights on law school so I can pursue a career advocating for the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p>After my first year of law school, I worked as an intern for the Department of Environmental Protection at the Harrisburg Office remotely. I enjoyed my work with them and wanted to pursue further work with other legal departments. I then learned more about PennFuture from past interns that worked there and realized that this would line up with my passions on protecting water quality, other species, even air quality throughout Pennsylvania. By joining PennFuture this summer, I have the joy of being able to use the law to protect the wildlife and to ensure everyone&#39;s health is protected in Pennsylvania!&quot;</p>

<p><u><strong>Daniela Rakhlina-Powsner is a rising third-year law student at Temple University&rsquo;s Beasley School of Law, where she is a Law and Public Policy Scholar and a Beasley Scholar.&nbsp;</strong></u></p>

<p>I graduated from Mount Holyoke College with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Neuroscience and Behavior with a minor in Russian Literature and Culture and a certificate in Culture, Health, and Science. At Temple, I served as Vice President of the Health Law Society and Secretary for the American Constitution Society, and this upcoming year I will be on the board of the Temple chapter of National Layer&rsquo;s Guild as the co-chair of the Environmental Justice Committee.</p>

<p>Last summer I worked as a legal fellow at the Center for Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE), a nonprofit organization that advocates for international sexual and reproductive health and rights as&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Daniela.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 225px; float: right;"" /> well as doing research for Temple Professor Duncan Hollis regarding international law norms surrounding cyber crimes, particularly pertaining to attacks against the healthcare sector.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming from a background in public health, I was driven to pursue environmental law because of the serious public health implications caused by environmental degradation and the climate crisis.<br />
Prior to joining PennFuture I interned for Pennsylvania environmental nonprofit Clean Air Council. In addition to working for PennFuture this summer, I am assisting Professor Craig Green with research concerning the legal status of Federal Indian Reservations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not working, I enjoy choral singing (at least pre-covid), board games, and playing with my dog Merlin.</p>

<p>* * *&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team is dedicated to restoring and protecting our environment and communities, to protecting our right to clean air and pure water, and to moving Pennsylvania toward a clean energy future. I thank our amazing staff and legal interns for their great work, and also our members for your continued support. We can&rsquo;t do this without you!&nbsp;</p>

Will Pennsylvania’s Environment Ever Be A Priority for the Legislature?,6/29/2021,"<p>Probably no profession requires taking the long view as does that of the environmental advocate. That&rsquo;s probably why I&rsquo;m so fond of the proverb, &ldquo;Hope springs eternal.&rdquo; It reminds me of the aspect of human nature that will always seek out cause for optimism, and I hold onto it because of that possibility.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Holding onto optimism feels a little challenging these days. Last week, the state budget that PennFuture so optimistically saw as a chance for lawmakers and the Governor to invest in a greener future, fell far short of making those investments, and the support for clean water we were hoping to see never materialized. Yes, the budget came through in important ways. The Governor and the legislature agreed to their funding priorities, none of them environmental. And perhaps, no surprise, fossil fuels made it to their list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This budget cycle again boosted fracking, and petrochemicals like fertilizer and plastics. We&rsquo;ve bellyached a lot in this blog about the largesse the legislature has shown the petrochemical industry through subsidies and other tax giveaways, and PennFuture has documented this serious problem most recently in <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">the third edition of our Fossil Fuel subsidy report.</a> When it passed <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-responds-to-passage-of-House-Bill-732"">House Bill 732 (Act 66) last summer</a>, state government set up $6.67 million in annual tax credits for up to four facilities that will use dry gas to produce petrochemicals or fertilizers.</p>

<p>Less than one year later, using the tax code legislation that accompanied last week&rsquo;s approved state budget, the legislature reduced the number of facilities (from four facilities, to up to two facilities) that can qualify for the tax credits, but left the aggregate cap in place guaranteeing there will be unallocated credits. The legislation also stipulated&nbsp;that the Department of Revenue must give those unallocated credits to only one of the qualifying facilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like so much else about Pennsylvania&rsquo;s opaque budget process, there was no transparency or forewarning that this move was afoot.&nbsp; It was presumably negotiated by the main budget players &ndash; Governor Wolf, Senate Majority Leader Kim Ward, Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, and Speaker of the House Bryan Cutler &ndash; and the closed-door process forces us to make these kinds of presumptions.&nbsp;What is verifiable is that the state budget and its accompanying tax and fiscal codes received a majority of votes and the Governor has signed the legislation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are also left to conjecture why the tax subsidy was re-structured so that a much larger piece of the subsidy pie will go to just one&nbsp;petrochemical manufacturer.&nbsp;We are concluding that there is indeed a petrochemical interest waiting in the wings, looking to set up shop here in Pennsylvania, but they sought a much sweeter pie.&nbsp;Hence the legislature and Governor have structured a revised subsidy that&#39;s grown from over $6.6 million to at least $20 million each&nbsp;year for the next 24 years&nbsp;for some lucky grand prize winner.&nbsp;The beneficiaries of these giveaways will in turn buy fracked gas, employ workers, and transform some lucky part&nbsp;of our magnificent state into a petrochemical industrial nightmare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some really great things could have been done with the budget this time around because state legislators and the Governor weren&rsquo;t constrained by revenue availability. They have in hand $7 billion in federal money to address Covid impacts including economic recovery and stimulus. Politicians didn&rsquo;t need to once again pick winners, and losers. But they did, and so lead in drinking water will go unaddressed, as will the thousands of miles of dead streams impacted by legacy pollution from coal, and they&rsquo;ve also forgotten the agricultural producers under scrutiny to put more best management practices on their lands and along waterways to improve the health of the Susquehanna River. Instead, politicians decided to bank more than half of the funds, rather than investing in assets like cleaner water, or making Pennsylvania more competitive in the green economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture works very hard for good outcomes, often playing defense. But the anti-environmental and anti-democracy members of the state legislature are running the show. We are grateful for the times the Governor has used his veto to stop the most egregious measures the legislature comes up with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture is taking some respite in an alternative pathway to meet our mission advocating for clean air and water, a healthy climate and green economy. It&rsquo;s a path that runs through Washington, not through Harrisburg. President Joe Biden is artfully trying to broker a bi-partisan infrastructure package. It seems separately, he&rsquo;s also attempting a complicated maneuver that may eventually get to investments that make us more climate resilient. But forgive me for being haunted by the ghost of 2013, when a sweeping cap and trade climate bill became a casualty of the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Another interesting proverb I&rsquo;ve pondered along the way is, &ldquo;Politics is the art of the possible.&rdquo; Making a lot of people happy is a rarity in politics, so count me as an unhappy Pennsylvania environmental advocate for the moment. But to think that the half-baked budget this state just approved pushed the limits of what is politically possible is not something I can accept.</p>

<p>The lack of work done by our legislators in the budget process feels lazy at best, blatantly irresponsible at worst, lacking vision and optimism. Nor will I be able to accept any federal infrastructure package that comes to fruition, if it is devoid of green infrastructure that can help us finally deal with the climate crisis. But there is still time to work hard for, and possibly achieve, a hopeful outcome.</p>

"The Chesapeake Bay is Improving, but Still a Long Road to 2025",6/25/2021,"<p>This week, the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) gave the Chesapeake Bay a C <a href=""https://ecoreportcard.org/site/assets/files/2452/2020-chesapeake-bay-watershed-report-card.pdf"">in their latest report card</a>. This is an improvement from last year&rsquo;s grade of C-.</p>

<p>UMCES assigns grades to numerous regions across the estuary and watershed. The Upper Bay, where Pennsylvania contributes 90 percent of the freshwater, received a grade of C, showing a health trend that is significantly improving. In Pennsylvania, the West Branch of the Susquehanna scored an A-, the Lower Susquehanna and Juniata watersheds received a B-, and the Middle Susquehanna a C+.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s report card has new social and economic indicators of watershed health, including stewardship, protected lands, walkability, and heat vulnerability. As the President for UMCES, Dr. Peter Goodwin, pointed out, &ldquo;Improvements in our environment go hand-in-hand with improvements in our communities, particularly those that are traditionally disadvantaged.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The indicators showed varying results. The scores for dissolved oxygen and total nitrogen improved. However, chlorophyll a&mdash;a measure of algae&mdash;and total phosphorus scores declined, with a slight decrease in water clarity, benthic community (aquatic life living at the bottom and an important food source for the ecosystem) and aquatic grass scores.</p>

<p>The UMCES says that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of Chesapeake Bay are not yet known, except for a reduction in atmospheric nitrogen from reduced travel and commuting. Between March and May 2020m, routine water monitoring did not take place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The good news is that long-term trends of the indicators are showing improvement,thus demonstrating that the efforts taken to improve the health of the stream that drains to the Chesapeake Bay are working.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is required to reduce its load of pollution into the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers by 34 million pounds of nitrogen and 756,000 pounds of phosphorus by 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has long remained behind in meeting clean water goals to address the health of the Chesapeake Bay. That&rsquo;s why this April, PennFuture released a report that provides a legislative roadmap to fully meet our funding and policy needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Titled<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Final-Chesapeake-report.pdf""> &ldquo;Underfunded and Polluted: Solutions to Fund Clean Water in Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake Bay Watershed,&rdquo;</a> our report puts forth a legislative agenda that, if acted upon, would provide the technical assistance, agency support, and public investments needed to put Pennsylvania on the path toward meeting the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load, or the so-called &ldquo;pollution diet&rdquo; goals, by its 2025 end date.</p>

<p>Efforts to improve the Bay will benefit our local waterways here in Pennsylvania. The Susquehanna River watershed&mdash;including a portion in New York&mdash; contains over 49,000 miles of streams. There are more than 15,000 miles of polluted streams within Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portions of the Susquehanna and Potomac River Basins alone.</p>

<p><u><strong>What We&#39;re Watching in the General Assembly</strong></u></p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s annual state budget must be passed by June 30th. PennFuture and our partners advocate for increases in funding for critical clean water programs at the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Department of Agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right now, Pennsylvania is faced with a unique opportunity. The recent passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 provides the Commonwealth with $7 billion in federal funds. We believe that <a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2021/06/pennsylvania-should-invest-federal-covid-relief-funds-in-clean-water-projects-opinion.html"">a portion of the funding should be invested</a> to improve and protect our rivers and streams. The state is also facing a potential $3 billion projected budget surplus.</p>

<p>We are working to secure dedicated funding for clean water through programs such as the creation of a Clean Streams Fund as well as a reinvigorated Growing Greener III program. We&rsquo;re advocating that a portion of this money&mdash;at least $500 million&mdash;be invested in our water resources which in turn supports jobs, a vibrant recreation economy, and supplies our drinking water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.trcp.org/2018/12/10/outdoor-recreation-ranks-pennsylvanias-economy/"">Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership</a> found that outdoor recreation in Pennsylvania contributes to over 390,000 jobs with a total value of $26.9 billion, including over $7 billion in federal, state, and local tax revenue.</p>

<p>Another bill we are tracking is the Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program, or ACAP, that is proposed to help farmers install conservation practices that improve and protect our rivers and streams. Senate Bill 465 would significantly improve the water quality impacted by nutrient pollution in Pennsylvania. Senate Bill 465:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Expands upon the Conservation Excellence Grant Program, a program from the PA Farm Bill;</li>
	<li>Provides flexibility and places decision-making power at the local level where counties and farmers can make decisions based on local need and benefit;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Can provide up to 100 percent of a project&rsquo;s cost, which can leverage other private and state and federal funding sources; and,</li>
	<li>Allows County Conservation Districts, the State Conservation Commission, and Penn State or similar institutions to keep a small percentage of allocated funds for technical assistance and administrative costs.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Another clean water bill we are tracking is SB 251. This is a lawn fertilizer bill that would reduce the excess nutrients that are impacting the health of our waterways. Over 2,600 miles of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s streams are impaired due to excess nutrients, which is the 5th leading cause. One source of excess nutrients comes from applying excess fertilizer. Passage of SB 251 will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a level playing field across the state and protect local waters. This bill will move towards one standard across the region, providing regional companies with similar market requirements to those in neighboring states</li>
	<li>Limit how much nitrogen and phosphorus are applied to turf (grass) protecting our waterways from excess nutrients running off into our streams.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Establish a professional fertilizer applicator certification program, similar to pesticide applicators, to ensure that professionals apply fertilizers at the proper rates.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Develop an Agricultural and Homeowner Education Program to educate nonprofessional applicators on the proper rate of applying fertilizers.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Protect consumers through standardization of fertilizer composition and labels.</li>
</ul>

<p>The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science&rsquo;s recent report card is proof that investments in our waterways can make an impact. It&rsquo;s encouraging to see the health of the Bay improve and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s passing grades.

Federal Court Dismissed Lawsuit Challenging DRBC’s Ban on Fracking,6/24/2021,"<p>We continue to bring you good news on the fracking front in the Delaware River Basin. In February 2021, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) took the <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fracking-Banned-in-Delaware-River-Basin"">monumental step in passing regulations</a> that ban the use of high volume hydraulic fracturing technology (&ldquo;fracking&rdquo;) to extract shale gas within the Delaware River Basin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As predicted, a legal challenge was quickly filed challenging the DRBC&rsquo;s authority to ban fracking, spearheaded by PA State Senators Gene Yaw and Lisa Baker, the PA Senate Republican Caucus, and several municipalities. PennFuture, joined by partners, responded by submitting a <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-Environmental-Groups-Law-Center-File-Friend-of-Court-Brief-in-Opposition-to-Challenge-to-Delaware-River-Basin-Commission-Fracking-Ban"">&ldquo;friend of the court&rdquo; brief</a> which focused on the erroneous Environmental Rights Amendment claims made by the plaintiffs. (Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution recognizes a fundamental public right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment and to have the Commonwealth conserve and maintain public natural resources for the benefit of present and future generations.) Our brief supported the arguments of the DRBC and intervenors that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this lawsuit.</p>

<p>On June 11, 2021, the District Court for the Eastern District of PA <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Opinion-on-Dismissing-Yaw-Suit.pdf"">agreed and dismissed the case</a> holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to file this case. Standing is the legal concept that ensures that a party has a &ldquo;dog in the fight&rdquo; &ndash; basically have they suffered the right kind of redressable injury to bring the lawsuit and &ldquo;stand&rdquo; before the court. Ultimately, Judge Paul S. Diamond concluded that this dispute &ldquo;is primarily partisan and is best resolved through the political process.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In particular, Judge Diamond disagreed with the Senators&rsquo; claims that state law vests them with sufficient interest to confer standing as does their claimed status as &ldquo;trustees&rdquo; under the Environmental Rights Amendment, calling these theories &ldquo;meritless.&rdquo; The plaintiffs failed to show that the DRBC&rsquo;s actions harmed them: &ldquo;Although all plaintiffs argue vigorously that they have standing, they do not.&rdquo; However, while foreclosed to the Senate plaintiffs, the court left open the possibility for the municipal plaintiffs to refile with strengthened allegations. The plaintiffs have 30 days to appeal this decision if they so choose.</p>

<p>The fact that DRBC&rsquo;s ban on fracking survived its first legal challenge is definitely cause for celebration! We have been waiting <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Moratorium-on-Fracking-in-the-Delaware-River-Basin-is-Critical-to-Protect-Our-Water"">for over a decade for the DRBC&rsquo;s ban</a> to become permanent and we believe the final ban will withstand any challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But challenges to DRBC&rsquo;s authority over fracking still remain. Not only could the municipal plaintiffs refile this case and the parties can also appeal the decision, but there is an outstanding 2016 lawsuit against DRBC filed by the Wayne Land and Mineral Group. That case challenges DRBC&rsquo;s authority under the Delaware River Basin Compact to regulate shale gas development in the Basin as a &ldquo;project.&rdquo; The impact of both the finalization of the DRBC&rsquo;s fracking ban regulations and the recent decision in Yaw v. DRBC is still being considered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the DRBC withdrew its proposed regulations on transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of fracking wastewater within the Basin and its proposed regulations on allowing Delaware River Basin water to be exported outside of the basin to be used in fracking operations. PennFuture took issue with their <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Public-Comment-Closes-on-DRBC-Fracking-Regulations"">first draft regulations</a> asking for them to be withdrawn because they were not protective of basin waters. The DRBC has until September 2021 to release new regulations on these matters.</p>

<p>PennFuture remains committed to protecting the Delaware River watershed from the harmful impacts of fracking and we will continue to engage on these matters. Please <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/donate"">become a member today</a> to support our efforts!</p>

Introduction: An Intersectional Approach to Fighting the Petrochemical Buildout in Pennsylvania,6/23/2021,"<p>Modern-day Pennsylvania was molded by the rapid technological advancements of the Industrial Revolution. The result of such advancements on human health, however, was devastating: these facilities required fossil fuels (which&nbsp;involve&nbsp;an environmentally destructive process to extract in the first place) which directly led to poor air quality, poisoned water, and destroyed soil in the decades to follow. Pennsylvania&#39;s&nbsp;residents are still feeling the effects of this today.</p>

<p>Science and technology have long been on a path of creating better machines which are much more environmentally friendly. However, especially in western Pennsylvania where I am now based, petrochemical companies are stubbornly refusing to acknowledge the world changing around them. Petrochemical companies hold over the heads of their workers the threat of losing their livelihood if the companies are further pushed by &ldquo;environmentalists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is why I joined the fight. I believe in the dignity of the human being, and thus, the dignity of the worker. Every citizen deserves not only a job, but a job that respects the air they breathe, water they drink, and land they live on. I aim to look at our work through this intersectional lens, as environmental issues (specifically the petrochemical and plastics issues) are directly correlated with every person&rsquo;s socioeconomic status, general health and wellbeing, and race, just to name a few.</p>

<p>My name is John Ukenye, and I am originally from South Florida, but am now based in Pittsburgh. Both sides of my family&rsquo;s story are immigrant ones, with my father&rsquo;s story in the United States beginning in Pittsburgh itself. After relocating to South Florida to continue his collegiate studies, he&nbsp;brought me to western Pennsylvania throughout my childhood and I fell in love with its natural beauty and the friendly people that live here. I knew early in my life that I was called to this state and to lend whatever talents I cultivated to help. The environmental realm is one that reaches all Pennsylvanians, and sits at the center of all other issues every person in the state faces.</p>

<p>My first direct experience in the environmental space was during my time as a law clerk with the U.S. House of Representatives&#39;&nbsp;Committee on Oversight and Reform, Subcommittee on Environment in Spring 2020, right before&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;reached &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo; designation. One of the last issues I was working on was preparing for a series of hearings on plastic pollution and the over-extraction of water from regional aquifers. I did research on how plastic water bottle manufacturers capitalized on the corroded lead pipe situation in Flint, Michigan by selling and donating what was essentially their own local tap water back to the affected people in the region, now additionally wrapped in toxic plastic single-use packaging. This situation perfectly highlighted the intersection between the environment, the plastics industry, race, and class.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My goal, from the moment I knew I wanted to go to law school, was to promote equity and justice no matter where I ended up. I fought my way through my undergraduate education, finished in three years with two degrees, honors, and Phi Beta Kappa and was admitted to Washington University School of Law where I graduated roughly a year ago. I graduated into a world that was facing a pandemic and a civil rights and social justice reckoning simultaneously, where race and class issues became dinner table conversations across the country and the globe. Average, everyday people&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intersectionality"">began to see the intersectionality</a> among EVERY issue, and these discussions continue on to this day. This is a perfect time as ever to view our work from a similar equity, justice, and intersectional perspective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our membership is no doubt plugged in to the environmental issues plaguing our world, country, state, and Appalachian region. While important to keep our supporters engaged, we must continue to actively reach out to those less informed about our area of work. It is those individuals who stand to be harmed the most by continued inaction on the environmental front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These individuals include both rural western Pennsylvanians (as well as the rest of Appalachia), especially those who work in the dying fracked gas industry, and Black and brown families that live near petrochemical plants due to historic redlining and environmental racism. Both groups stand to gain from uniting against the fracked gas, petrochemical, and plastics industries. Both groups are in generally in the same socioeconomic class, and both generally face the same issues of dirty air, water, and land caused by the petrochemical industry and plastic pollution. It is this disproportionate burden of <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/OfficeofEnvironmentalJustice/pages/default.aspx"">harmful environmental and human health impacts</a> that environmental justice seeks to overcome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both groups include hardworking people trying to feed their families, and do not deserve to have their ability to provide for their families threatened by petrochemical companies that are simultaneously destroying their land, water, and air.</p>

<p>We must explicitly recognize this intersectionality in the work we do, highlight both their struggles and triumphs from local leaders in the environmental space, and work to do our part to encourage the creation of better-paying green jobs that respect workers&#39; rights&nbsp;to breath, drink, and live freely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Biden Administration Working to Repeal Trump's 'Dirty Water Rule',6/17/2021,"<p>We bring to you another update in the decades-long saga of protecting &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; (WOTUS) under the federal Clean Water Act, but this time it is a positive step toward renewing federal jurisdiction over some of our most critical streams and wetlands that were stripped of protection by the Trump Administration in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the United States Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2006 split decision in Rapanos v. United States, there has been uncertainty and litigation over what waterbodies classify as WOTUS and therefore will fall within the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s protections. PennFuture joined <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Opposes-Any-Repeal-of-the-Clean-Water-Rule"">over 50,000 Pennsylvanians in supporting the 2015 Clean Water Rule</a> that attempted to bring clarity to the definition of WOTUS. And we vigorously opposed <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Opposes-Any-Repeal-of-the-Clean-Water-Rule"">the Trump Administration&rsquo;s repeal</a> and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Submits-Comments-Opposing-the-Dirty-Water-Rule-Engages-More-Than-1400-Citizens-to-Do-the-Same"">replacement of the Clean Water Rule</a> with the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule, more correctly known as the &ldquo;Dirty Water Rule.&rdquo; Despite numerous legal challenges across the nation which lead to a patchwork of rules, as of March 2021, the Dirty Water Rule is in effect in all 50 states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On June 9, 2021, however, the Biden administration <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/wotus/intention-revise-definition-waters-united-states"">formally began the process to repeal and replace</a> the Dirty Water Rule, which reduced the number of water bodies that would be protected by the Clean Water Act <a href=""https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/biden-moves-to-restore-clean-water-safeguards-ended-by-trump/ar-AAKSsNZ?ocid=BingNewsSearch"">by twenty-five percent</a> and was determined to have led to significant environmental degradation, with thousands of streams and hundreds of permits at jeopardy. Across the country, thousands of wetlands and waterways that maintain water quality and drinking water sources and protect nearby communities from flooding <a href=""https://www.southernenvironment.org/news-and-press/news-feed/biden-administration-announcement-leaves-crucial-waters-in-jeopardy"">have already been destroyed</a> as a result of the Dirty Water Rule.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Dirty Water Rule excludes ephemeral waters (temporary water bodies that only occur after precipitation) and wetlands that are not physically connected to a navigable water body by a visible surface connection. The rule is not based on science and greatly benefited the oil and gas industry and developers by allowing them to fill in wetlands and streams without a permit. The reality is that wetlands are extremely important natural filters that protect waterbodies, whether they are visibly connected by a continuous surface connection or not. Ephemeral waters <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-03/documents/ephemeral_streams_report_final_508-kepner.pdf"">play crucial ecological and hydrological roles</a> in maintaining water quality and watershed function and health, and are particularly important in the southwestern states. The EPA&rsquo;s own data shows that ephemeral waters provide drinking water to 117 million Americans.</p>

<p>The new rule will aim to restore protections and establish a durable definition of protected waters. EPA&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-army-announce-intent-revise-definition-wotus"">news release explained</a> that the new rule will be informed by Supreme Court precedent, lessons learned from current and previous regulations, and stakeholder engagement. Additionally, it will be guided by considerations to protect water resources and communities, science and the effects of climate change to national waters, and efforts for practical implementation in states and Tribal communities. The Dirty Water Rule, by contrast, <a href=""https://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/ea5d9a9b55cc319285256cbd005a472e/5939af1252ddadfb852584e10053d472/$FILE/WOTUS SAB Draft Commentary_10_16_19_.pdf"">was admonished by EPA&rsquo;s own science advisors</a> as being in conflict with established science and the objectives of the Clean Water Act.</p>

<p>And some of the impacts from the Dirty Water Rule are already being felt locally by threatening restoration efforts of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed because excluded waters feed into the Chesapeake Bay. The Choose Clean Water Coalition, a coalition of organizations that advocate for clean rivers and streams in the Chesapeake Bay region of which PennFuture is the PA State Lead, <a href=""https://www.choosecleanwater.org/news/2021/6/10/plans-to-repeal-dirty-water-rule-a-big-win-for-chesapeake-bay"">released a statement supporting the EPA&rsquo;s decision</a> to revise the current rule and also urge them to replace it with one that restores protections to waterways and wetlands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stakeholders are encouraged to share their input during the rulemaking process. <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/wotus/public-outreach-and-stakeholder-engagement-activities-forthcoming"">Information on opportunities for public engagement</a> are forthcoming and PennFuture intends to engage in this process to ensure full protections of our critical headwaters and wetlands. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/donate"">Become a PennFuture member today</a> to stay informed and get engaged!</p>

The Plastics Problem: More False Strategies: Statewide Preemption,6/15/2021,"<p>Regular readers of this blog will be familiar with the Pennsylvania Legislature&rsquo;s attempts to <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Regulatory-Reforms-Would-Roll-Back-Environmental-and-Health-Protections"">stymie advances in environmental protection</a> and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Legislators-Continue-to-Stand-in-the-Way-of-Climate-Action"">efforts to deny the realities of climate change.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Legislature has been employing a new strategy when it comes to promoting plastics and petrochemicals, and it is just as problematic. That problematic strategy is known as &ldquo;preemption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Preemption is the legal concept that a higher-level governmental body can prevent or overrule the actions of lower-level governmental bodies. For example, the federal government can pass laws or regulations that stop a state from passing different laws on a specific issue , or that override laws previously passed by a state on an issue. Similarly, a state legislature can pass laws that stop or override municipalities in that state from enacting laws&nbsp; or override laws that the municipality has previously passed.</p>

<p>Preemption is not, in the abstract,&nbsp; necessarily a bad thing. There are reasons why a state might want to have a whole-of-state approach to a certain issue, rather than having piecemeal regulation by different municipalities across the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the state may want to have - and indeed does have! - uniform rules on how drivers&rsquo; licenses are issued because there is a reasonable interest in having statewide uniformity in requirements for testing and licensing procedures, rather than having each town or city design its own rules for allowing drivers on the roads.</p>

<p>Here, however, the Legislature is not trying to make uniform rules across the Commonwealth for safety reasons, or to lessen the burden on municipalities, or to benefit a statewide goal.&nbsp; Here, the legislature is trying to stop municipalities from taking environmentally-beneficial actions in order to protect the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries.</p>

<p>The first example is the Legislature&rsquo;s action to prevent municipalities from banning single-use plastic bags.</p>

<p>In June of 2019, the Pennsylvania Legislature passed a fiscal code amendment (SB712) that included, as an add-on provision unconnected to the rest of the fiscal code, a prohibition which states: the &ldquo;General Assembly or a local governmental body or agency may not enact a law, rule, regulation or ordinance imposing a tax on or relating to the use, disposition, sale, prohibition or restriction of single-use plastics, reusable plastics, auxiliary containers, wrappings, or polystyrene containers&rdquo; until a report on the economic and environmental impact of plastics on the Commonwealth was submitted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This report was submitted in June 2020.&nbsp; Around that same time, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Legislature again used the fiscal code to effectively delay implementation of any current plastic bag bans at least until July 1, 2021, or six months after the COVID-19 state of emergency is lifted.</p>

<p>Why would the Legislature do this?&nbsp;In order to promote uniform plastics laws across the Commonwealth?&nbsp;This cannot be the case, because there are no other statewide plastics laws in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;In fact, the Legislature here is not acting to promote positive statewide regulation at all, but instead to promote the petrochemical industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The state&rsquo;s own report on &ldquo;The Economic Impacts of Regulation of Single Use Plastics&rdquo; is very clear:&nbsp; &ldquo;The regulation of single-use plastics could also have indirect implications for the prospective clustering of petrochemical manufacturing facilities in the state. Pennsylvania is the second-largest producer of natural gas in the U.S. and the state&rsquo;s capacity for natural gas production and proximity to major markets make it an attractive location for new petrochemical facilities...Industry representatives noted that single-use plastics regulation could make the state a less viable option for prospective petrochemical and plastics manufacturers:&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ifo.state.pa.us/download.cfm?file=Resources/Documents/Single-Use%20Plastics%20Report-2020_06.pdf"">Economic Impact Report at page 33, 35.</a></p>

<p>Municipalities, of course, <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/plastic-bag-preemption-suit-takes-aim-at-long-time-harrisburg-dealmaking-mechanism/"">have taken a different view.</a>&nbsp;Municipalities across the state have considered banning or otherwise regulating single-use plastics.&nbsp;The City of Philadelphia, Narbeth, and West Chester have passed ordinances doing so. Other municipalities, such as Ferguson Township in Centre County, the City of Bethlehem, and the City of Pittsburgh have actively considered doing so.&nbsp; These local government entities have pointed to <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/philadelphia-single-use-plastic-bag-ban-mark-squilla-20190620.html"">plastic bag litter in their borders and clogging their waterways</a> as reasons to pass these ordinances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second example is the Legislature&rsquo;s ongoing attempt to prevent municipalities from restricting the types of energy used in buildings.&nbsp;Again, why would the legislature do this?&nbsp;To promote a uniform energy policy across the state?&nbsp;No, it is clear that the Legislature wants to promote the use of fracked gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The legislature previously tried, through Act 13 in 2013, to specifically eliminate the ability of municipalities to regulate the development of oil and gas resources. The PA State Supreme Court <a href=""http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-127A-D-2012oajc.pdf"">struck down this provision</a> as a violation of the Environmental Rights Amendment of the Pennsylvania Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Legislature <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/an-energy-choice-bill-has-some-lawmakers-worried-local-government-could-lose-power/"">is currently trying to enact very similar legislation</a> targeted at utility services rather than gas development companies, but the effect would be the same, and by focusing only on utility services the proposed legislation <a href=""https://local-government.pasenategop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2021/05/Additional-Testimony-PENNFUTURE-Letter-to-PA-Senate-on-SB-275-May-7-2021.pdf"">would give preferential treatment</a> to the polluting gas industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the City of Philadelphia, the Office of Sustainability <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/editorials/philadelphia-gas-works-pgw-public-utility-climate-change-lng-20210607.html"">is conducting a study</a> about how the gas utility, Philadelphia Gas Works, can transition away from being an entirely gas-driven utility, in line with Mayor Jim Kenney&#39;s commitment that Philadelphia will achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in alignment with the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;The Legislature&rsquo;s preemption attempt here would stop this work in Philadelphia in its tracks.</p>

<p>To be fair, the Pennsylvania Legislature is not alone in attempting to stop the municipalities in its state from making positive environmental changes.&nbsp; This is a strategy that national anti-regulatory groups are pushing to state legislatures nationwide to prevent local governments from taking the initiative to solve their own problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The real problem with this sort of preemption is that it doesn&rsquo;t solve any problems - it just puts up roadblocks to creating meaningful policy change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Legislature is not pushing solutions or enacting statewide policies; instead, it is just telling municipalities that they are prevented from the sort of creative problem solving that the American system of federalism is supposed to promote. When it comes to the problem of plastics, we need real solutions, not roadblocks.</p>

"Coal-Fired Power Plant to Close Because of Market Conditions, Not Environmental Regulations",6/11/2021,"<p>On June 9, the owner of the Cheswick coal-fired power plant in Allegheny County, Houston-based GenOn Holdings LLC, announced that the plant <a href=""https://www.genon.com/genon-news/genon-holdings-llc-announces-retirement-of-three-coal-fired-power-plants"">would cease operations effective on&nbsp;Sept. 15, 2021.</a></p>

<p>This was no surprise to industry-watchers and, despite the claims from polluters and their friends, this had little to do with environmental regulations. To be sure, Cheswick&mdash;one of the top emitters of toxic air pollutants in Allegheny County&mdash;is facing lawsuits for releasing hot water into the Allegheny River and for inappropriately turning off pollution control equipment, but even without these lawsuits, Cheswick was struggling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the energy we use in Pennsylvania is purchased at auctions run by our grid operator, PJM Interconnection. Generators that bid low enough to clear these auctions get called up to run and provide us power&mdash;in return they receive whatever the market-clearing price is for the energy that PJM needs to meet demand.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>As I write this on June 10, the spot market was clearing around $25 per megawatt-hour.&nbsp; A plant like Cheswick could, at least theoretically, earn over $300,000 a day in conditions like this and much more if prices spike higher. But, to earn anything at all, it needs to be among the least-expensive resources available to meet demand. This is a problem for Cheswick, as it is a relatively small plant with a single generating unit that uses an older and less-efficient process&mdash;while these were once common in Pennsylvania, it is the last of its kind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even when coal plants were competitive, they wouldn&rsquo;t always be able to run at full capacity for long periods of time as required maintenance and market factors would drive down capacity factors. Seeing these facilities averaging around 60% capacity over the course of a year wasn&rsquo;t unusual.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Increasingly, though, coal plants that are able to run are too expensive to clear the PJM auction and sit idle. According to data from the Energy Information Administration, Cheswick averaged only 15% of its rated capacity in 2019 and not even 10% of its rated capacity in 2020.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s terrible for any business&mdash;no one would expect a restaurant to stay open if 90% of its tables remained empty.</p>

<p>Cheswick was likely only hanging on because of some additional revenue from other sources.&nbsp; Alongside the energy market, PJM also runs a capacity market designed to ensure we have sufficient generation available to meet our needs in the future. This is also an auction system where PJM predicts the amount of generation it will need years in advance and generators submit bids committing to be available, if needed, for a price. Back in 2018, PJM ran an auction for the 2021/22 delivery year that cleared at $140 per megawatt-day for most of the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over-procuring capacity is a serious problem in these auctions. Every extra megawatt of capacity PJM buys drives up the clearing price, forcing consumers to spend billions of dollars more than necessary and, in many cases, those billions subsidize inefficient, old, and dirty fossil fuel plants running that would otherwise retire. Cheswick is a prime example, a plant that size could see almost $30 million in revenue this year from the capacity market, even if they are rarely called upon to actually generate energy.</p>

<p>The capacity auction for next year (the 2022/23 delivery year) would have taken place in 2019, but market adjustments required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) delayed the auction until this year. A number of factors, including not needing to predict demand three years in advance, meant PJM didn&rsquo;t find it necessary to procure nearly as much additional capacity. That led to much lower capacity prices.</p>

<p>Where this year, capacity resources are getting $140 per megawatt-day, next year those payments will drop to&nbsp; $50 per megawatt-day.&nbsp;This drop in the clearing price <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/tom-rutigliano/how-save-four-billion-without-really-trying"">will save consumers about $4.2 billion dollars</a> in total or about $100 on the average electricity bill over the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not buying billions worth of unnecessary capacity is a huge win for consumers, but it&rsquo;s very bad news for coal. This year we saw 8,175 fewer megawatts worth of coal capacity cleared the market than did in the previous auction. One of the casualties of this was the Cheswick plant.&nbsp; About a week after the PJM auction results were released, the plant&#39;s owner, GenOn, announced that the plant would cease operation effective June 1, 2022&mdash;the first day of PJM&rsquo;s 2022/23 delivery year.</p>

<p>Any time a fossil fuel plant retires, polluters and their backers almost always blame environmental rules. This is no exception and opponents of Pennsylvania joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) have already made repeated claims that the extra expense from RGGI (which hasn&rsquo;t gone into effect yet) was the reason Cheswick failed to clear the PJM capacity auction. This makes no sense as capacity resources are just making a commitment to be available if called, not necessarily to run. Operating costs, such as RGGI&rsquo;s emissions fees, should be reflected in the company&rsquo;s energy market bids, not the capacity market.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
RGGI opponents who make these claims are also saying that if we keep the status quo, where plants like this get to pollute for free, these plants will stay open for ten years or more. The part they don&rsquo;t say out loud is that if polluters don&rsquo;t pay for the cost of their pollution, the rest of us do.&nbsp; Increased pollution means more suffering and premature deaths, higher healthcare and insurance costs for everyone, and lost productivity that increases the costs of everything we buy.&nbsp; On top of that, the added carbon pollution in particular contributes to the trillions of dollars in damages from climate change.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that, even accepting the risks and the consequences of dirty power, a coal plant that operates at less than ten percent capacity could stay open very long. Even if Cheswick cleared the capacity market this year, they would still lose almost $20 million in revenue because of the lower capacity prices next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We just tried four years of polluter-friendly policies during the Trump administration and the results are clear.&nbsp; Coal generation in Pennsylvania fell by a greater percentage over the past four years than it did during President Obama&rsquo;s entire 8-year term.&nbsp; Pennsylvania now has only three conventional steam coal plants left that have yet to announce plans to retire or stop burning coal, and those are all close to retirement-age. Rather than lie to workers and communities telling them that opposing RGGI and other environmental programs will save coal jobs, we should be actively managing the transition in our energy sector that is clearly already happening.</p>

<p>Joining RGGI gives us a pathway to be proactive in addressing this issue. Both the DEP and legislators such as Senators Comitta and Representative Herrin have proposed plans to invest a large part of the proceeds from participating in RGGI in areas most impacted by fossil fuels. This includes investments in Environmental Justice communities that have long faced the consequences of disproportionately high levels of pollution&mdash;much of which comes from fossil fuel power plants.&nbsp;This also includes the workers and communities that are impacted by the failure of these plants.</p>

<p>There is still room for policymakers to step up and have a good faith debate over how to best manage the changes in our energy economy and how best to address the climate crisis. Unfortunately, too many policymakers are quick to oppose proposals like RGGI without offering real alternatives that will lead to a sustainable future.&nbsp;</p>

"The Plastics Problem:  Identifying False Solutions, Part 1",5/26/2021,"<p>The scope of our plastic pollution problem is well known. Plastic escapes into the environment <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020320225"">at all stages of its life cycle</a>. Once in the environment, most plastic finds its way into waterways and <a href=""https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/microplastics.html"">breaks down into microplastics</a>. Those microplastics can be consumed by fish, birds, and other wildlife, and they are finding their way into <a href=""https://orbmedia.org/stories/Invisibles_final_report"">drinking water</a>, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/13/world/atmospheric-plastics-study-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html#:~:text=The%20research%20team%20collected%20atmospheric,across%20the%20US%20each%20year.&amp;text=Once%20they%20enter%20the%20atmosphere,days%2C%20according%20to%20the%20study."">air</a>, and even people&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/from-fish-to-humans-a-microplastic-invasion-may-be-taking-a-toll/"">bodies</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/22/microplastics-revealed-in-placentas-unborn-babies"">placentas</a>.</p>

<p>A recent <a href=""https://pennenvironment.org/reports/pac/microplastics-pennsylvania"">report by PennEnvironment</a> found that 100% of the Pennsylvania waterways&nbsp;sampled contained microplastics. Additionally, plastics contain a host of <a href=""https://www.consumerreports.org/toxic-chemicals-substances/most-plastic-products-contain-potentially-toxic-chemicals/"">potentially toxic chemicals</a> like BPA, flame retardants, and phthalates. These toxins can also be found in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/phthalates-everyday-products-toxics-guide"">the environment, in wildlife, and in our own bodies.</a></p>

<p>What is not fully known are the long term impacts that plastic pollution will have on human and environmental health. A 2019 report from <a href=""https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Plastic-and-Health-The-Hidden-Costs-of-a-Plastic-Planet-February-2019.pdf"">Center for International Environmental Law</a> reviewed the health impacts of plastic from cradle to grave. They reported that human exposure to plastic has been linked to a wide variety of human health issues including inflammation of several different organ systems, developmental toxicity, and cancer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crisis is here and can no longer be ignored. The plastic industry knows this and is forming partnerships across the world to come up with solutions to address plastic pollution. The industry has proposed improved recyclability and recycling infrastructure and new end uses for plastics like chemical recycling and plastics to energy plants (See PennFuture&rsquo;s blog <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Recycling-is-exacerbating-the-plastic-waste-crisis"">Recycling is Exacerbating the Plastic Waste Crisis</a>). However, proposals to reduce plastic production and use are rare. In fact, the industry is <a href=""https://www.slideshare.net/MarcellusDN/acc-shale-gas-and-new-us-chemical-industry-investment-164-billion-and-counting"">actively increasing their infrastructure</a> and the World Economic Forum has estimated that <a href=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf"">production of plastics will quadruple</a> by 2050 in a business as usual scenario.</p>

<p>While improving recycling infrastructure worldwide may play a role in keeping plastic out of the environment, there is good reason to be skeptical of recycling as THE solution to the plastic crisis. Despite the fact that plastic recycling has been <a href=""https://www.plasticsmakeitpossible.com/about-plastics/history-of-plastics/the-history-of-recycling-plastic/#:~:text=1972,began%20operations%20in%20Conshohocken%2C%20Pa."">widely available for decades</a>, only <a href=""https://www.unep.org/interactive/beat-plastic-pollution/"">9% of plastic ever produced has been recycled</a>. In 2018, China closed its borders to contaminated plastic waste, exposing the ugly truth - that the system was and always has been broken. The farce of plastic recycling was further <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled"">exposed by NPR and PBS Frontline</a> in 2020. The investigation found that the plastic industry had spent millions of dollars supporting recycling programs, despite the fact that they knew the system was doomed to fail, in order to <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/822597631/plastic-wars-three-takeaways-from-the-fight-over-the-future-of-plastics"">sell more plastic</a>.</p>

<p>New end uses for plastic like chemical or advanced &ldquo;recycling&rdquo; and plastic to energy plants are being proposed by the plastic industry as solutions to the plastic problem. They go so far as to say this is <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/advanced-recycling-pennsylvania-plastics-fossil-fuel-climate-change-20201203.html"">part of a circular economy</a>. However, the products of chemical recycling are most often burned, contributing more greenhouse gases and pollutants to our already overburdened atmosphere.</p>

<p>Communities are bearing the brunt of plastic pollution and <a href=""https://www.keeppabeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KPB-Litter-Cost-Study-013120.pdf"">the costs of cleaning it up</a>. The plastic industry should not be relied upon to solve this problem in a way that benefits them. Instead policies that reduce plastic production and use are needed. These policies should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Eliminate subsidies to fossil fuel companies that contribute to low plastic prices and overabundance of fracked gas;</li>
	<li>Hold companies accountable for the life of their plastic products and their negative impacts to the environment;&nbsp;</li>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.pahouse.com/zerowaste"">Zero Waste PA legislative package</a> and federal <a href=""https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/pollution-act/"">Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act</a> are examples of state and federal policies to address the plastic crisis.

What Comes Next in Pennsylvania's Efforts to Join RGGI?,5/20/2021,"<p>In October of 2019, Governor Wolf issued an executive order to begin the process of joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).&nbsp;Through this program, Pennsylvania will cooperate with other states in the northeast to cap the emissions of carbon pollution from fossil fuel electric generation because, <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-takes-executive-action-to-combat-climate-change-carbon-emissions/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CClimate%20change%20is%20the%20most,emissions%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Governor%20Wolf.&amp;text=In%20order%20to%20show%20compliance,ton%20of%20CO2%2C%20they%20emit."">as the Governor said at the time</a>,&nbsp;&ldquo;climate change is the most critical environmental threat confronting the world, and power generation is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the Governor started the process with an executive order, actually joining RGGI requires passing a new regulation: the CO2 Budget Trading Program.</p>

<p>Even with the Governor&rsquo;s executive order, regulations don&rsquo;t just happen.&nbsp;Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Regulatory Review Act and Commonwealth Documents Law create a detailed program of review, checks, and balances, which often takes 18 to 24 months to complete.&nbsp;With the RGGI rule, the Pennsylvania&nbsp;Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is 19 months into the process.</p>

<p>The last major milestone was at the end of 2020 when the public was invited to comment on the proposed version of the rule. The DEP took 32 hours of testimony from 449 people and accepted 14,038 written comments. The vast majority of comments supported moving forward, and, as expected, there were also a number of recommendations for updates and clarifications.</p>

<p>The DEP considered all of that input from residents and updated its&nbsp;proposal accordingly.&nbsp;This language&mdash;known as the &ldquo;draft final-form rulemaking&rdquo;&mdash;was just presented to the Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee, the Small Business Compliance Advisory Committee, and the Citizens Advisory Council.&nbsp;All three of these organizations voted to endorse the rule and move forward.</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s encouraging these organizations endorsed the DEP&rsquo;s plan, these votes were advisory in nature. The vote that really counts&nbsp;is expected to happen this summer when the DEP presents the complete rulemaking package, including responses to all the public comments, to the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) for&nbsp;formal approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>EQB approval is a big step, but even that doesn&rsquo;t end the review process.&nbsp;After that vote the entire package must be delivered to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) and the Environmental Resources and Energy committees in both the state Senate and the House of Representatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>IRRC is a panel of five members appointed by the Governor and legislative branch who review regulations and advise whether or not&nbsp;the Regulatory Review Act criteria have been met, and if it is in the best interest of Pennsylvania to proceed. The panel&nbsp;will consider the RGGI rulemaking at their next public meeting that is at least 30 days after they receive the package.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If IRRC votes to approve the rule, the process moves to the next step.&nbsp;If IRRC votes to disapprove the rule, the DEP has 40 days to resubmit or withdraw the package.&nbsp;The DEP isn&rsquo;t actually required to change anything in response to IRRC&rsquo;s concerns, but the agency&nbsp;needs to explain its&nbsp;decision not to make changes and IRRC will get another chance to consider the rule.&nbsp; A vote to disapprove will slow the process, but IRRC doesn&rsquo;t have the authority to stop a rulemaking from proceeding. The result of a second vote, no matter what the outcome, is simply reported to the committees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In most cases, the standing committees take no action on rules one way or another, but we&rsquo;ve already seen multiple attempts to block RGGI by the legislature, and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine either of the current committee chairs, Rep. Darryl Metcalfe and Sen.&nbsp;Gene Yaw, missing an opportunity to stall its implementation.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s practically certain that the committees will report a concurrent resolution disapproving of the rule.&nbsp;That will create a delay of 30 calendar days or ten legislative days (whichever is longer) while the General Assembly considers the resolution.</p>

<p>Given the composition of the Legislature, it&rsquo;s very likely that this resolution will pass.&nbsp;But, the Pennsylvania&nbsp;Supreme Court has made it clear that there is no such thing as a &ldquo;legislative veto&rdquo; in Pennsylvania&mdash;the only way the Legislature can actually block the program is if the Governor agrees to the resolution or the General Assembly has the two-thirds majority needed to override his veto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The General Assembly has already attempted to kill the program more than once and, so far, hasn&#39;t&nbsp;found the necessary votes.&nbsp;Having failed to obtain a veto-proof majority, and unwilling to accept the Constitutional limits on their power, members of the Senate <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-responds-to-state-Senates-refusal-to-vote-on-PUC-nomination"">even took the unprecedented step</a> of threatening to reject all of Governor Wolf&rsquo;s Publicly Utility Commission nominations unless he agrees to their demands and withdraws the rule.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s seemingly destined to fail, moving a resolution of disapproval will delay implementation at least 30 days.&nbsp;Then, once that resolution is vetoed, the General Assembly will have at least 30 days more to try and override the veto.&nbsp;Ultimately, the anti-RGGI forces are unlikely to prevail and sooner or later, the rule will be sent to the Attorney General for a final review as to legality and form before being published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and going into effect.</p>

<p>Pennsylvanians want action on climate change and we need a plan to provide a sustainable path forward for the workers and communities impacted by the failures of the fossil fuel industry. For all the rhetoric from the opposition, they have failed to suggest an alternative besides sitting on their hands and doing nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, doing nothing for as long as possible seems to be the goal.&nbsp;While the opposition has little chance of stopping the program, if they can string enough delaying tactics together it may be possible to push back the start date of the program by a couple of months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Delays like this could give polluters more time to dump carbon pollution in our air for free.&nbsp;That is bad for Pennsylvania, but profitable for the polluting industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Regulatory Reforms Would Roll Back Environmental and Health Protections,5/19/2021,"<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s legislators appear eager to overhaul how the Commonwealth reviews and implements state law. Don&rsquo;t be distracted. The winners of their latest proposals would likely be polluters &mdash; at the expense of public health and the environment.</p>

<p>Too often, regulations get a bad rap. Seen as burdensome&nbsp;to some, in truth, regulations are merely administrative tools to achieve the General Assembly&rsquo;s policy goals. Regulations allow us to adapt laws to changing times and to ensure new laws are implemented in ways that are safe, fair and legal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Permits seem to be in their crosshairs as well. Onerous &ldquo;red tape&rdquo; to some, in fact, permits are designed to ensure state laws are respected and enforced equitably and effectively.&nbsp; Undermining the process to develop new regulations and implement permits puts Pennsylvania&rsquo;s air and water, workers, consumers, health and economy at risk. That&rsquo;s why the latest proposals are so worrisome.</p>

<p>HB 139 (Rothman &ndash; R, Cumberland County) mandates that state agencies contract with third-party &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; to review certain permit applications. In practice, the bill would force the already time and cash-strapped Department of Environmental Protection to create a third-party review program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of expediting the review process, this would simply undermine it. Outsourcing reviews of federally delegated permits would likely be illegal. And, given the lack of any conflict-of-interest provisions, the legislation would enable polluters to review their own requests to go on polluting.</p>

<p>HB 288 (O&rsquo;Neal &ndash; R, Washington County) would require agencies designate a &ldquo;regulatory compliance officer&rdquo; empowered to establish guidelines for waiving fines or penalties. A polluter would simply need to self report their own violation prior to being penalized.&nbsp;Waiving fines and penalties may be appropriate in some circumstances. But those decisions should be made using a thorough and transparent process by agency officials who are publicly accountable. Otherwise, this proposal risks creating a simple get-out-of-jail-free card for anyone who pollutes.</p>

<p>HB 939 (Klunk &ndash; R, York County) is another regulatory rollback that, last year, PennFuture and other environmental groups across the state helped to defeat. In this year&rsquo;s version, the bill would add another layer of bureaucracy to the General Assembly by creating a new review board, potentially creating tension with the current committee system. Originally, this bill would have also established a nonsense rule that, for every new regulation promulgated by an agency, two existing regulations would need to be repealed. Due to widespread public pushback, the prime sponsor of the bill amended out this dangerous provision to make it more palatable for the House to pass.</p>

<p>Other proposals we&rsquo;re fighting back against include two proposals that we consider unconstitutional attempts to take power from the executive branch. HB 72 (Keefer &ndash; R, York and Cumberland Counties) would require House or Senate approval of final-form regulations, essentially giving each chamber a veto over new regulations if they cost more than $1 million to implement the protection. HB 950 (Metcalfe &ndash; R, Butler County) would weaken permitting and rulemaking abilities by prohibiting state agencies from reissuing regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Too often, leaders in the General Assembly decry the overreach and burden of regulations and permits. But at the same time, budget cuts and wrongheaded legislative proposals limit the abilities for our state agencies to do their job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rather than helping to create more efficient and effective government, these latest proposals create extraneous and added layers of bureaucracy, impede the roles of our executive branch agencies, and undermine the protections enforced and implemented by our state government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture will continue to post updates as these counter-productive proposals make their way through the General Assembly.&nbsp;</p>

Electric Mobility Legislation Could Supercharge EV Infrastructure,5/5/2021,"<p>Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) may have slowed during the coronavirus pandemic. But market forces clearly signal that the future of transportation will be electric.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In preparation, legislation is making its way through the General Assembly that could supercharge electric mobility across the Commonwealth. The <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=435"">Clean Transportation Infrastructure Act</a> will require that the state&rsquo;s electric utilities develop comprehensive strategies to expand accessibility and to improve affordability of vehicle charging infrastructure.</p>

<p>Transportation accounts for a large and growing share of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The state&rsquo;s 2020 GHG Inventory shows oil- and gas- powered vehicles are responsible for 25 percent of statewide emissions. That&rsquo;s up by about 4 percent from two years prior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, change is coming. Across Pennsylvania, public transit agencies and school districts are investing in battery-electric vehicles. Utilities, delivery companies and other private fleet owners are going electric. More individual owners are plugging in EVs at home or at work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Technology improvements are driving down vehicle costs, while allowing batteries to retain charges over longer distances. These improvements &mdash; combined with a renewed attention from the federal government on decarbonizing transport &mdash; <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/electric-mobility-after-the-crisis-why-an-auto-slowdown-wont-hurt-ev-demand"">are fueling growth forecasts</a>. U.S. electric vehicles are expected to reach 3-6 percent of new sales by 2022 and up to 36 percent by 2030.</p>

<p>SB 435, introduced by Sen. Bob Mensch, will require the Public Utilities Commission to set a statewide transportation electrification goal, encouraging a 50-percent increase in battery-electric, hydrogen or fuel cell electric vehicles over current Pennsylvania 2030 forecasts.</p>

<p>Less than 30,000 EVs were registered in Pennsylvania as of November 2020, according to the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s Pennsylvania <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/StateEnergyProgram/PAElectricVehRoadmapBookletDEP5334.pdf"">Electric Vehicle Roadmap</a>. EV ownership here is about 25 percent of neighboring New Jersey&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Massive electrification of the transportation sector will require large-scale investment in new electric distribution and widespread installation of new charging infrastructure. To better prepare for this transformation, SB 435 would require the state&rsquo;s largest utilities develop electrification plans for the 18 largest counties across the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Importantly, SB 435 would also allow utilities to recover costs for building new charging infrastructure or for incentivizing property owners and private developers to install chargers at their homes, offices, bus depots, shopping centers, parking garages and wherever else it&rsquo;s needed. The legislation sets a maximum surcharge of 0.25 percent on annual customer bills.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Benefits of SB 435 would include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Developing a strategy to overcome the main barrier to EV accessibility &mdash; the availability of charging infrastructure.</li>
	<li>Assisting regions across the state meet Clean Air Act air quality targets.</li>
	<li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to the climate crisis.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Supporting economic development by displacing imported oil with electricity generated from Pennsylvania-based energy resources including renewable energy.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Promoting economic growth and job creation by encouraging private investment in cars, buses and equipment that Pennsylvania businesses are helping to develop.</li>
	<li>Requiring extensive transportation sector coordination and regulatory review of any proposed utility EV infrastructure investments.</li>
	<li>Positioning Pennsylvania for leadership as changes underway across the transportation industry continue to unfold.</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture strongly supports SB 435. We are part of a broad and diverse coalition of organizations that believe this legislation provides a thoughtful and well-balanced framework to significantly advance EVs in Pennsylvania.</p>

Legislators Continue to Stand in the Way of Climate Action,5/4/2021,"<p>Leaders in the General Assembly are offering more unproductive proposals that would undermine Pennsylvania&rsquo;s entry into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Despite past failed attempts, again and again, they expect different results. As the saying goes, their approach to climate policy is truly insane.</p>

<p>This latest attempt comes as an abundance of Pennsylvanians support climate action. The only logical explanation for ignoring the will of the voters is that our state&rsquo;s legislators prefer to do the bidding of the state&rsquo;s fossil fuel industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shameful undermining of climate progress comes in the form of Senate Bill 119 (Pittman - R, Indiana County). The proposal would strip away the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s statutory authority to adopt regulations to reduce carbon pollution from any source, including power plants. This is despite clear precedent that the governor possesses legal authority to implement a cap-and-invest carbon reduction program.</p>

<p>Make no mistake; the intention of the bill&rsquo;s sponsors is clear. If Pennsylvania were to join RGGI, power plants would no longer be allowed to release carbon pollution for free. The power sector would have to start paying a price for air pollution that they cause.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Governor Tom Wolf&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/executive-order-2019-07-commonwealth-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change-through-electric-sector-emissions-reductions/"">Executive Order 2019-07 instructed the DEP to develop</a> a cap-and-invest program that aligns with RGGI. Joining RGGI would encourage innovation and create a revenue stream that Pennsylvania could re-invest in programs that further reduce air pollution. Other states are already reaping the benefits. Ten current RGGI member states <a href=""https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">have experienced $1.4 billion in net economic benefits</a> between 2015 and 2017.</p>

<p>Yet another effort to prevent action on climate change &mdash; a similar bill <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-responds-to-veto-of-House-Bill-2025"">was vetoed last September by Governor Wolf</a> &mdash; SB 119 would preserve the profit margins of fossil fuel executives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
SB 119 not only reflects a lack of desire among the Legislature to lead on climate progress. It reflects a failure to listen to voters across the state.</p>

<p>After RGGI was explained in a recent poll, <a href=""https://www.centredaily.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/article246260895.html"">more than 70 percent of surveyed Pennsylvanians</a> expressed their support. The public clearly understands that RGGI membership would have beneficial effects on addressing climate change, improving public health and boosting the state&rsquo;s economy.</p>

<p>DEP has been working for months drafting RGGI regulations, listening to thousands of comments from industry, advocacy groups and ordinary Pennsylvanians. Instead of working with the administration to improve the rulemaking process, SB 119 is a waste of state resources and another disappointing attempt to block DEP from combating the climate crisis.</p>

<p>SB 119 could come up for a vote in the state Senate as soon as next week when the Senate returns to session.&nbsp;</p>

Pennsylvania vs. the Future,4/30/2021,"<p>In other parts of our nation, it is the spring of 2021.&nbsp;We have a president who understands that climate change is a crisis, who is making the first movements in a long time towards incorporating environmental justice issues into decision-making, and who is bringing a &ldquo;whole of government approach&rdquo; to environmental problems.</p>

<p>In addition to President Biden&rsquo;s early executive orders on climate change and other environmental issues, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-A-Breath-of-Fresh-Air-Two-Steps-and-Hopefully-More-Forward-on-Environmental-Justice-and-Water-Protection"">which we previously covered in this blog</a>, the administration has advanced concrete policy proposals that include climate goals at their core.</p>

<p>The American Jobs Plan provides funding for infrastructure, clean energy, innovation, manufacturing and workplace support, and the caregiving economy. By incorporating support for the renewable electric grid into a key economic plan, the President is <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Time-to-Hesitate-is-Through"">trying to launch a more sustainable American economy</a> while simultaneously combating climate change.&nbsp;Additionally, last week, the President <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/"">announced a commitment to 50-52 percent reduction</a> from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030.&nbsp;This is not just a goal - it is the United States&rsquo; &ldquo;nationally determined contribution&rdquo; or &ldquo;NDC,&rdquo; which is a formal submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>While the United States&rsquo; goal is certainly not easy or automatic, the administration recognizes that an ambitious goal is necessary and is explicitly connecting policies and plans for job creation and economic development to responding to the climate crisis.</p>

<p>But in the Pennsylvania legislature, things are different.&nbsp;Our legislature seems determined to resist any attempts to move forward and remains firmly stuck in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the past few weeks, both the State House and the State Senate have released a flurry of proposed legislation designed to push Pennsylvania back into the past. Some of these are explicitly designed to prevent action on climate change, and others are less explicit but still clearly motivated by a desire to frustrate problem-solving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>An example of an explicitly anti-environment bill is Senate Bill 119 (Pittman - R, Indiana County), which would take away DEP&rsquo;s statutory authority to adopt regulations to reduce carbon pollution from any source, including power plants consistent with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).&nbsp;This bill was vetoed last September by Governor Wolf.&nbsp; DEP has been working round the clock for months on its proposed RGGI regulations, including listening to thousands of comments from industry, advocacy groups, and ordinary Pennsylvanians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no purpose to this bill other than to waste state resources and attempt to frustrate a meaningful attempt to combat the climate change that threatens our future.</p>

<p>Then there is House Bill 939, which, among other things, would create a process for &quot;sunsetting&quot; existing regulations by capping the number of regulations and requiring the repeal of two existing regulations for every new regulation promulgated.&nbsp;If this sounds familiar, it is because the former presidential administration attempted to do this on a federal level.&nbsp;Looking for models in the abject failures of the last administration is not the way to move into the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, the legislature is not the entirety of the government in the Commonwealth.&nbsp;Governor Wolf issued an executive order committing the state to purchase at least 40% of its electricity from new solar arrays built here.&nbsp;Municipalities like the City of Philadelphia are taking climate change seriously and committing to ambitious carbon reduction goals to try to get there.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just the legislature that is stuck.</p>

PennFuture Releases New Report to Save Chesapeake Bay,4/8/2021,"<p>We are at an inflection point for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s efforts to save the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>What policymakers in the Keystone State do&mdash;or more importantly, what they do not do&mdash;over the next five years will determine not only the fate of many of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s rivers and streams in the Susquehanna and Potomac River Basins, but also the fate of America&rsquo;s largest estuary and third largest in the world.</p>

<p>There are more than 15,000 miles of polluted streams within Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion of the Susquehanna and Potomac River basins. The Susquehanna River itself is the source of drinking water for 6.2 million people. This pollution impacts how we use our water&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s fewer opportunities for fishing, unsafe waters for recreation, or high costs for using it for drinking and business.</p>

<p>The river&rsquo;s pollution stretches well beyond our state borders. Half of all the freshwater that comprises the Chesapeake Bay comes from Pennsylvania, which means Pennsylvania plays an important role in ongoing efforts to clean up the polluted bay.</p>

<p>While Pennsylvania isn&rsquo;t the only culprit&mdash;five other states and Washington, D.C. also contribute to the problem&mdash;our contributions are among the highest, especially for nitrogen. The dirty water in the basin is so dire that Pennsylvania has been placed under a so-called &ldquo;pollution diet&rdquo; by the Environmental Protection Agency meant to limit the amount of pollution we send down into the Susquehanna and Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>With that sense of urgency in mind, PennFuture today released a policy agenda designed to give Pennsylvania lawmakers a roadmap to fund clean water programs and to get us back on track toward meeting our obligations to clean up the bay.</p>

<p>The report, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Final-Chesapeake-report.pdf"">&ldquo;Underfunded and Polluted: Solutions to Fund Clean Water in Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake Bay Watershed,&rdquo;</a> puts forth a legislative agenda that, if acted upon, would provide the technical assistance, agency support, and public investments needed to put Pennsylvania on the path toward meeting our &ldquo;pollution diet&rdquo; goals by the 2025 deadline.</p>

<p>Specifically, we recommend policy solutions and funding amounts that would result in the reduction of pollution from its major source&mdash;agriculture lands&mdash;as well as stormwater runoff and forestry-related practices. We also recommend that our state agencies are funded properly and operating with sufficient capacity to carry out the programs and assistance needed to accomplish state pollution goals.</p>

<p>The report also identifies funding mechanisms that are available to state legislators to help&nbsp; achieve these policy goals, including a severance tax on natural gas extraction, eliminating the sales tax exemption for bottled water, levying a fee on single-use plastic bags, and establishing a water use fee for large commercial operations in Pennsylvania, among others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pathways spelled out in our report complement efforts already underway in the state Capitol, as two bills with bipartisan support could soon come up for a vote in Harrisburg.&nbsp;<br />
The first is SB 251 which seeks to implement new standards and regulations on lawn fertilizer application across Pennsylvania, while SB 465 would create a statewide Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program to help more farmers and landowners implement practices to combat nonpoint source agricultural runoff to our streams, creeks, and rivers. We will be watching these bills closely and doing our part to support them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Properly funding clean water initiatives isn&rsquo;t just the right thing to do, it&rsquo;s the smart thing to do. Clean water is a critical component of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s thriving recreation economy, which is the 6th largest in the country and produced $13 billion in revenue, according to 2019 figures. It&rsquo;s also a critical investment in our farmers, one of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s top economic sectors accounting for approximately $83.8 billion in direct economic output and over 280,500 jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now is a critical time for state policy leaders to show its residents that they&rsquo;re upholding their right to clean water and good health as well as strongly support its recreation businesses and farmers.</p>

<p>Now is the time to invest in our waterways.&nbsp;</p>

The Time to Hesitate is Through,4/1/2021,"<p>President Joe Biden&rsquo;s American Jobs Plan&nbsp;announcement in Pittsburgh elicits great pride in being a Pennsylvanian. It feels like it&rsquo;s been ages since the leader of the United States has put forth a vision of the future that moves us forward&mdash;no matter whether we work in the frack fields or an office building, reside in a rural county or city, or we&rsquo;re beset by pollution or economic hardship. It&rsquo;s a historic initiative, that if enacted fully by Congress, would be a watershed moment for the country and Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Biden&rsquo;s economic plan goes way beyond kick-starting an economy hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;At its core, the President&rsquo;s American Jobs Plan would overhaul our antiquated infrastructure, build resiliency to extreme weather and support new carbon reduction technologies that match and excel beyond the efforts of global competitors currently making their mark in this sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plan will launch a more sustainable American economy anchored by cutting-edge business sectors and family-sustaining jobs that don&rsquo;t rely on polluting our communities and children to succeed. The President&rsquo;s plan would finally and proportionally invest in addressing the climate crisis&nbsp;by deploying renewable energy, retrofitting homes and businesses, investing in clean energy innovation, and advancing ways for industry to lower its carbon footprint.&nbsp;The plan will rightly will give our country a fighting start to meet the daily reality of climate change.&nbsp;And it will seed the projects, tools and technologies we need to address the climate crisis, one made more evident every day, and neglected for far too long.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But of all the places he could have made his announcement, why did the President choose Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania?&nbsp; One reason is the abundance of concrete proposals and feasible ideas emanating from the region that are in sync with the President&rsquo;s economic vision, including&nbsp;<a href=""https://reimagineappalachia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ReImagineAppalachia_Blueprint_092020.pdf"">Reimagine Appalachia&rsquo;s blueprint</a>, <a href=""https://www.sustainablebusiness.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/marshall_plan_for_middle_america_roadmap_0.pdf"">the Marshall Plan for Middle America</a>, and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Green-Stimulus-FINAL.pdf"">PennFuture&rsquo;s Green Stimulus and Economic Recovery Platform for Pennsylvania</a>. These independently-crafted platforms all share the common goal of lifting up the Commonwealth through shared prosperity and future-oriented, sustainable economic opportunities.</p>

<p>Why do such synergies exist between the region and the President&rsquo;s economic plan? Maybe only an individual like President Biden, whose formative years were spent in the coal fields of upper Appalachia&rsquo;s Anthracite region, can get why perpetuating fossil fuels as the foundation for future economic growth and opportunity is wrong on so many fronts. As someone who, like the President, has kept their ties to the region, its scarred landscapes, and its strong and proud people, I understand firsthand the President&rsquo;s perspective.</p>

<p>Appalachia&rsquo;s coal fields, where the President was born, are a poster-child for what the American Jobs Plan aims to address: boom-and-bust cycles of fossil fuels industries crippling towns, oppression wrought by big companies when workers are unprotected by unions, and the psychological and demoralizing impacts keeping coal communities from pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. Biden experienced and was witness to these declines, and knows they are frightening for communities in the midst of such change, and equally frightening for policymakers to understand and address.</p>

<p>Unless, that is, you are the kind of leader that Biden is, whose experience and empathy has won him much political support from the region and from local influencers who share his vision.&nbsp;President Biden&rsquo;s vision of prosperity is anchored in the future, and not a distant future, but rather one that is within our reach, if we can all stretch just a bit further and take hold.&nbsp;If we can drop our swords, together we can take a run at doing something monumental and meaningful for our people, to set the country up for success in the new economy, and to make things right for the have-nots among us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fight for the President&rsquo;s American Jobs Plan will be a political battle, to be sure.&nbsp;The thing that will make the fight so tough is partisan identity. Ideologies, political or otherwise, divide and blind us to what is right before our eyes: opportunity and seeing that the world around us has changed. Internationally, we see the most powerful and influential regions shift to a sustainable future, while America drags its feet because there are those among us who don&rsquo;t want to see others &ldquo;win&rdquo; or because some among us believe we can stop societal or demographic change using a wall, an insurrection, a vote, or the suppression of one.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Back here in Pennsylvania, and at PennFuture, we are all for making up for lost time and lost opportunity.&nbsp;We stand eager and ready to move beyond the societal infighting and work to advance solutions that benefit all of us. We are leaning hard into the prospects for federal action on resilient infrastructure and climate solutions.&nbsp;We believe if passed, the President&rsquo;s American Jobs Plan can yield great things for our state. If nothing else, is any part of Pennsylvania really so prosperous that it and its elected representatives in Congress &ndash; regardless of party &ndash; have the luxury of dismissing these investments in our common future?</p>

<p>Biden&rsquo;s proposals are showing bipartisan support among voters. The time has come for courageous leadership from all corners of the state to come to the table and give the President&rsquo;s proposals a fair hearing and chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Net Metering Works for Pennsylvania,3/31/2021,"<p>In the early days of distributed generation, utilities would sell power to consumers at the retail rate but, if customers were able to sell excess power they generated back to the utility at all, the utilities would only pay the much-lower wholesale rate.&nbsp;This systematically undervalued the benefits of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar power and provided very little incentive to invest in such systems.&nbsp;Today, most states require some form of &ldquo;net metering&rdquo; to ensure customers are more fairly paid for their generation.&nbsp;Even where it is not required, state regulators must at least consider rules to make&nbsp;net metering available<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>A number of different generation technologies can qualify for net metering, but grid-tie solar systems on homes and businesses are probably the most common. They use a device known as an inverter to turn the low-voltage DC the solar panels produce to the higher-voltage AC we use to power lights and appliances.&nbsp;Such systems are designed to draw power from the local electricity distribution grid whenever they need it and send power back when they have excess.&nbsp;This type of system is often much simpler to install and much less expensive than off-the-grid alternatives that require batteries or other backup generation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a recent study found that overall, &ldquo;grid-tied utility customers are being grossly undercompensated in most of the U.S. as the value of solar eclipses the net metering rate<sup>2</sup>.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>The value of net metered solar generation</strong></u></p>

<p>Most consumers recognize the value of buying from local businesses, even when big online stores might offer lower prices.&nbsp;Buying local supports the jobs that were created in the community to build and operate that business, and the money consumers spend locally is more likely to stay in that community.&nbsp;Operating a small solar system shares many of these same benefits.</p>

<p>A small solar system installed on a home or business should easily pay for itself&nbsp;in avoided energy costs over the life of the equipment.&nbsp;But, these systems have more value than just the direct energy savings that they provide to their owners&mdash;they provide benefits to all ratepayers throughout the community.</p>

<p>Because most of our electricity is purchased&nbsp; through wholesale market auctions, adding any new behind-the-meter generation<sup>3</sup> results in less demand and, therefore, lowers the market clearing price.&nbsp;This lowers wholesale prices for everyone&mdash;even on days when the solar panels aren&rsquo;t sending any power back to the grid<sup>4</sup>.&nbsp;Solar generation can magnify this effect when more power is produced on the same hot summer days that electricity demand, and wholesale prices, often peak.</p>

<p>Besides moderating wholesale energy prices, having more distributed generation can lead to lower spending on reserve generating capacity and infrastructure. Nationally, we spend over $100 billion a year to maintain and upgrade our grid&mdash;avoiding even a small fraction of those costs can result in significant savings.</p>

<p>In addition to savings on energy, capacity, and infrastructure, newer technologies like smart inverters can also provide a wide range of valuable grid services.&nbsp;These include things like load following, reactive power support, demand response, and other services that consumers never need to think about but are important to grid operators who need to keep the system functioning smoothly and efficiently.</p>

<p>The benefits of additional clean generation go far beyond direct savings for ratepayers and grid operators.&nbsp;Every megawatt of avoided fossil fuel generation means less pollution&mdash;including smog-forming chemicals, cancer-causing air toxics, and the carbon pollution driving climate change.&nbsp;Less pollution means less spending on medical care and increased productivity.</p>

<p>Fairness demands that we pay net-metered solar generators for the full value of the services they provide.</p>

<p><u><strong>Net Metering in Pennsylvania</strong></u></p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act includes a requirement that &ldquo;excess generation from net-metered customer-generators shall receive full retail value for all energy produced on an annual basis<sup>5</sup>.&rdquo; That is a strong standard but, to date, neither our Public Utility Commission (PUC) nor our courts have fact-based determination on what &ldquo;full retail value&rdquo; actually is. Moreover, there is reason to believe that the PUC&rsquo;s current proxies for full retail value may understate actual full retail value.</p>

<p>PUC rules specify that customers get a bill credit for the &ldquo;full retail rate&rdquo; (emphasis added) for net generation month-to-month and, that where a customer has not been compensated for all of its igeneration at the end of the year, the customer should be paid for that net generation the &ldquo;price to compare&rdquo; (i.e. the amount that customers who do not shop on PA Power Switch pay for electricity&nbsp; generation and transmission)<sup>6</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two problems with this framework. First, retail rates are a very coarse approximation of value.&nbsp;Value depends on factors that rates do not fully take into account.&nbsp;As one study put it, an accurate value of solar requires&nbsp; &ldquo;evaluating economic development costs, the avoided fuel hedge costs, the avoided voltage regulation costs, secondary health and environmental effects such as increased crop yields from PV-reduced pollution, and accurate estimations of the value of avoided GHG liability costs or avoided GHG emissions liability insurance.<sup>7</sup>&rdquo; These are not things typically reflected in retail rates and particularly not in the lower price-to-compare</p>

<p><u><strong>Defending Net Metering</strong></u></p>

<p>When SolarReviews looked at state net metering policies in early 2021, Pennsylvania earned fairly high ratings compared to other states but had some room for improvement<sup>8</sup>. Keeping the gains we&rsquo;ve made hasn&rsquo;t been without its challenges.&nbsp;Utility trade associations like the Edison Electric Institute, and anti-regulatory groups like ALEC have been leading the attacks.</p>

<p>They generally start by ignoring the non-energy values of solar generation and then push the false narrative that paying net metered generators anything more than wholesale prices always represents a cost shift that impacts other ratepayers.&nbsp;When distributed solar levels become high, as they have in California, cost-shifting can become an issue. But critics of net metering routinely make these claims even where distributed solar levels are low, as they are in Pennsylvania, and&nbsp;despite the lack of actual evidence.</p>

<p>Back in 2016, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s own PUC fell victim to these arguments and attempted to create more barriers to net metered generation.&nbsp;PennFuture and other solar advocates were successful in preventing new caps on the size of net-metered systems, arguing that the PUC simply didn&rsquo;t have the authority to substitute their judgment for that of our Legislature. Still, problems remained.</p>

<p>One of the most obvious problems was the Commission&rsquo;s view on virtual meter aggregation.&nbsp;AEPS specifically allows a net metered generation system to be attached to a separate electric meter, provided it&rsquo;s within two miles of the primary meter.&nbsp;This is particularly useful for farms where a nearby field is a more suitable location than the existing house or barn.&nbsp;PUC tried to add the arbitrary restriction that any such remote site needed a pre-existing independent electric load.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Commision said at the time this was necessary to prevent &ldquo;utilities&rdquo; from qualifying for net metering.&nbsp;This never made any sense. Since Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Electricity Generation Customer Choice and Competition Act passed in 1996, utilities have divested of all their generation assets<sup>9</sup> and, as we pointed out at the time, utilities are prevented from qualifying for net metering because the AEPS defines a net-metered customer generator as a &ldquo;non-utility&rdquo;<sup>10</sup>. Moreover, we argued PUC just doesn&rsquo;t have the authority under Pennsylvania law to create new restrictions that go beyond what the Legislature provided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though the Independent Regulatory Review Commission agreed with our position and disapproved the new restrictions, the PUC went forward and promulgated the faulty rules. I wrote back at the time that &ldquo;people may be denied interconnection for their solar systems in situations where the legislation gives them the right to install that generation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not surprisingly, that is exactly what happened.</p>

<p><u><strong>A Belated Victory</strong></u></p>

<p>On Feb 17, the PA Supreme Court upheld a May 2020 decision by the Commonwealth Court<sup>11</sup> regarding the PUC&rsquo;s attempt to regulate net metering and virtual net metering. That ruling made it clear we were correct on several important points when we made comments to the PUC and IRRC back in 2016.</p>

<p>The court held the PUC&rsquo;s authority related to net metering is exactly what the AEPS statute says&mdash;they may enact &ldquo;technical and net metering interconnection rules,&rdquo; not address broader questions of energy policy. The Legislature set specific limitations regarding the size of net metered systems along with other policy decisions and it&rsquo;s not the PUC&rsquo;s role to second-guess the laws.</p>

<p>The court also made it clear that, while the PUC has broad authority to regulate utilities, that doesn&rsquo;t grant them the power to limit net metered generation because &quot;the AEPS Act applies to &#39;customer-generators,&#39; which by definition are not public utilities.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also, the PUC&rsquo;s attempt to redefine the term utility to include companies that are not public utilities is unenforceable as it &quot;attempts to redefine statutory eligibility standards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, the independent load requirement for virtual net metering was specifically rejected as it has no basis in the statute and beyond the PUC authority. It took a number of years, but it&rsquo;s encouraging to know our reading of the legislation was correct.</p>

<p><u><strong>What this means going forward</strong></u></p>

<p>While this ruling fixes the glaring problems with the PUCs rules,&nbsp;there are still some parts of the existing legislation that can be improved.</p>

<p>A significant number of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s households and businesses don&rsquo;t have effective solar access. This is particularly true for renters and those living in multi-family households, but there are a number of other issues that can make it difficult for homeowners to generate their own clean energy.</p>

<p>Many states have fixed this problem by enabling community solar.&nbsp;Under these rules, a family or business may buy or lease a share of a larger solar system and receive a credit on their energy bill for the power their share of the system generates.</p>

<p>While this is similar to &ldquo;virtual meter aggregation&rdquo; as defined by AEPS, the existing rules have additional restrictions that will keep community solar from happening.&nbsp;The current rules say that&nbsp;the remote site hosting the solar system be owned or leased by the same entity as the primary electric meter it is to be netted with.&nbsp;In addition, that remote site must be within 2-miles of the primary meter.</p>

<p>There is a fix on the horizon&mdash;Sen. Scavello recently introduced SB 472 in the Pennsylvania Senate and we expect a similar bill to be introduced by Rep. Kauffer in the House that will specifically enable community solar generation.&nbsp;This will allow qualifying systems to share their generation among a number of subscribers.</p>

<p>The one piece that is still outstanding is whether or not customer generators are actually getting the full retail value for the energy they generate and the services they provide.&nbsp; A fair and independent analysis that includes all the energy and ancillary benefits of distributed generation and clean renewable energy would go a long way to filling this gap.&nbsp; Then PUC Vice Chairman Andrew Place was correct when he said &ldquo;consumers are best served by getting the &lsquo;retail value&rsquo; price right<sup>12</sup>.</p>

A Banner Week for the Delaware River Watershed,3/5/2021,"<div>
<p>It was a banner week for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion of the Delaware River Watershed, as three events unfolded here that could have enormous ramifications for clean water for decades to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first big event occurred on Feb. 25 when <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/fracking-ban-delaware-river-permanent-drbc-20210225.html"">the Delaware River Basin Commission permanently banned fracking</a> within the basin, a truly momentous step for clean water in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The move came after a decade of considerations and studies by the commission, as well as lawsuits by the fracked gas industry and Pennsylvania politicians <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2021/01/18/State-senators-lawsuit-fracking-ban-pennsylvania-Delaware-River-Basin-baker-yaw/stories/202101180072"">who sought to undo a fracking moratorium</a> imposed by the DRBC in 2010.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite that, the commission&mdash;composed of the governors of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware, with the federal representative abstaining&mdash;voted last week to permanently ban fracking in the basin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In explaining his vote, <a href=""https://www.nj.com/news/2021/02/fracking-permanently-banned-in-delaware-river-basin.html"">New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said that</a> &ldquo;fracking poses significant risks to the water resources of the Delaware River Basin,&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s right. The Delaware River Basin provides drinking water to 13 million people, which is reason enough to protect it at all costs.</p>

<p>In addition, the fracked gas industry in Pennsylvania <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Setting-the-Record-Straight-About-Fracking-in-Pennsylvania"">has a long and infamous history of disrespecting our laws</a>, communities, shared resources and environment, and it cannot be trusted to act in our best interests. This means that the health of local communities in the basin is also protected from the devastating impacts of fracking, impacts that go beyond water contamination.</p>

<p>In casting a vote on behalf of Gov. Tom Wolf, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Patrick McDonnell said the fracking ban will preserve our pristine water resources in the basin <a href=""http://www.paenvironmentdigest.com/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=52380&amp;SubjectID="">&ldquo;for generations to come.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Another significant development for clean water in the basin came on March 3 when Philadelphia and several nearby municipalities <a href=""https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/green/philly-some-suburbs-drag-pa-to-court-over-blocking-plastic-bag-bans/2727375/"">announced litigation against the state</a> concerning the so-called &ldquo;ban on plastic bag bans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For context, in 2019 and again in 2020, the General Assembly in Harrisburg passed legislation that forbids any municipality in Pennsylvania from banning plastic bags. This absurd legislation takes away the ability for our municipalities to act in their own self interest, and prevents us from taking real and meaningful action to prevent the clogging of our waterways with plastics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically, Philadelphia&rsquo;s lawsuit&mdash;which PennFuture steadfastly supports&mdash;seeks to have this legislation declared as unconstitutional so that municipalities across Pennsylvania can finally take measures to keep the proliferation of plastics out of our waters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To see what PennFuture and others had to say about this lawsuit, <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/2021-03-03-philadelphia-and-other-municipalities-file-litigation-to-assert-right-to-restrict-plastic-bags/"">please click here.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, also on March 3, PennFuture banded together with partners to file a petition designed to spur the DRBC to further protect fish and aquatic life by upgrading the regulatory status of the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington reach of the Delaware River.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The initiative seeks to ensure that water quality standards governing the river provide full Clean Water Act protections and adequate dissolved oxygen for the survival of fish and other aquatic life.</p>

<p>Both independent studies and DRBC&rsquo;s own reviews confirm that fish already use the identified river reach every year for spawning and nursery habitats, and that upgraded protections are clearly warranted. This action is needed to ensure that endangered Atlantic sturgeon, striped bass, American shad, and all other aquatic life dependent on clean water receive the proper level of protection from pollution now and into the future.</p>

<p>This petition is in addition to our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Petitions-DRBC-to-Recognize-Primary-Contact-Recreation-on-the-Mainstem-Delaware-River"">Safe and Healthy Delaware River Petition</a> which we filed with DRBC last year, which calls on the agency to recognize and legally protect the primary contact recreational use (e.g., swimming, jet skiing, paddleboarding, etc.) of the Philadelphia-Camden stretch of the Delaware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To read what PennFuture had to say about our latest DRBC petition, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PR_DRBC.Petition_3.3.2021.pdf"">please click here.</a></p>

<p>Last year, a national environmental advocacy group called American Rivers named the Delaware as its <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Congratulations-to-the-Delaware-River"">2020 River of the Year</a> because of its clean water resurgence. With the actions taken over the last week, we&rsquo;re confident that the Delaware River Basin is still flowing in the right direction when it comes to clean water protections.&nbsp;</p>

$296,3/2/2021,"<p>PennFuture has published the third edition of a Fossil Fuel Subsidy report that first appeared in 2011. The 2021 version is entitled <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">&ldquo;Buried Out of Sight: Uncovering Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Hidden Fossil Fuel Subsidies.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Our report reveals that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fossil fuel subsidies total $3.8 billion, with 52 percent of that amount benefitting fracked gas and petrochemicals. At a time of a climate emergency,&nbsp;pandemic, racial reckoning and an economic downturn that somehow is building extravagant wealth for billionaires while others struggle to make rent and buy food, the inequity and cronyism behind these subsidies strikes one as especially appalling.</p>

<p>The report is having an impact.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve heard from many throughout the state who are dismayed over the findings, but who are glad the information is seeing the light of day. They are reacting most to the figure that when spread across all residents of Pennsylvania, these subsidies amount to $296 per person living here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boosters of fracking, petrochemicals and plastics want to keep this information hidden from the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report has hit a nerve over at Frack Central&mdash;the cabal of trade associations and companies that coordinate their advocacy to protect these subsidies&mdash;whose public relations machine is churning out messages accusing our meticulously researched report as sloppy. They falsely argue that our commonsense recommendations to have polluters pay their fair share to do business in our state is the equivalent of calling for your taxes to be increased.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizers of Frack Central, like the Marcellus Shale Coalition, are singularly focused on attacking the report. This includes their lazy messaging that distorts and simplifies our very sophisticated analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our most basic recommendation is that state agencies be charged with transparency and that they make subsidy information publicly available on a regular basis.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>These distortions by industry spin doctors will not be an effective rebuttal of our report&rsquo;s analysis and our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Subsidy-graph.JPG"">daylighting of the facts and figures</a> that make up the tangled and hidden truth behind these $3.8 million in subsidies. Frack Central&rsquo;s smear campaign has traction, though, when it gets amplified by its friends in the legislature, and elsewhere, and this is happening.</p>

<p>I invite you to review the dense report, with an eye <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Subsidy-chart.JPG"">to the chart on page 4</a>.&nbsp;There, you can see for yourself the long list of offending exemptions from taxes that the rest of us are subject to, and that can produce tax revenues, including for local governments and services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact is the financial largesse of subsidies shown to the fossil fuel industry is hurting our state&rsquo;s bottom line.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s remember these subsidies are provided with the blessing of many state elected officials, and the Governor, who are often at odds with each other on the topic of how to generate much needed new revenues in our state. So why make the money matter worse through these goodies to the fossil fuel industry?</p>

<p>The fact is that these subsidies are robbing our state of $2 billion annually in foregone revenues. If the majority of subsidies could be abolished, we can level the playing field between frackers and fossils, and pretty much everyone else including taxpayers, small businesses and other less-favored business sectors who have many fewer lobbyists in Harrisburg pleading their case.</p>

<p>The time has come for the fossil fuel industry to pay its fair share and its most egregious subsidies terminated. This includes paying even the most basic taxes from which frackers and crackers are exempted, namely paying property taxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, since PennFuture&rsquo;s report is based on the most recently available information from 2019, it discusses, but does not calculate, the financial impacts and lost revenues associated with two recent subsidies directed toward petrochemical development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First is the subsidy package totaling $1.6 billion in grants, tax exemptions and other programs offered to Royal Dutch Shell for its ethane cracker in Beaver County. According to Good Jobs First Subsidy Tracker, Shell ranks seventh among the companies that have generated the most public subsidies in the United States, totaling more than $2.04 billion, with other support also coming from places like Louisiana and Texas. The $1.65 billion package Pennsylvania offered Shell is over 15 times the size of the next largest corporate subsidy offered here. The second largest was a&nbsp;$100 million package granted to Volkswagen in the late 1970s for a manufacturing plant in Westmoreland County. The 2.8-million-square foot plant is now closed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second are the subsidies recently approved in July 2020 (House Bill 732) for petrochemical facilities. This legislation includes tax credits &ndash; in place for 26 years and adding up to over $693 million in foregone tax revenue &ndash; and is made available for up to four facilities that manufacture only petrochemicals and fertilizers using fracked gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other words, in a couple of years it&rsquo;s very possible Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fossil fuel subsidy package will balloon from $3.7 billion to almost $6 billion. Yet, Pennsylvania legislators argue nearly every spring about Pennsylvania&rsquo;s budget deficit or high taxes&nbsp;when one of the reasons for these perpetual challenges is their own doing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture hopes that by bringing sunlight to this growing subsidy problem in Pennsylvania, better policy making can happen in the future. The perpetual cycle of subsidies, boom, and bust fossil fuel industries is a detriment to the Commonwealth. Breaking this feedback loop is one of the keys to a better future.</p>

A Breath of Fresh Air: How Will the Biden Administration Fight Carbon Pollution?,3/1/2021,"<p>The beginning of 2021 has been busy for clean energy advocates.</p>

<p>On January 14th, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection wrapped up its public comment period on its proposed CO2 Budget Trading Program, through which Pennsylvania would cooperate with the other Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) states to minimize dangerous emissions across much of the northeast and invest in cleaner alternatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all, DEP heard from 449 citizens over a series of ten virtual public hearings and from over 14,000 citizens who submitted written comments. The response was overwhelmingly positive and shows the vast support across Pennsylvania for cutting carbon pollution and fighting climate change.</p>

<p>Just days after the DEP wrapped up this process, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the Trump administration&rsquo;s anti-environmental &ldquo;ACE rule&rdquo;.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Although ACE stands for &ldquo;Affordable Clean Energy&rdquo; that name was always a cynical joke. The Clean Air Act requires power plants to adopt the best system of emissions reduction (BSER) to cut pollution that endangers public health and welfare. With ACE however, Trump&rsquo;s EPA attempted to redefine BSER to exclude the most cost effective approaches&mdash;including programs like the DEP&rsquo;s CO2 Budget Trading Program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Repealing ACE was sure to be a high priority for the incoming Biden administration, but the cumbersome regulatory process to do so could easily have taken years. Fortunately, the D.C. Circuit&rsquo;s action throwing out the Trump EPA&rsquo;s horrible plan saves the Biden administration the effort of scrapping it. Now, the new leadership at EPA can focus their attention on what the next steps should be.</p>

<p>We won&rsquo;t know exactly what the new plan will look like until EPA releases a proposal, but we can make some educated guesses based on other initiatives of the Biden administration.</p>

<p>While Trump made a public show of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, actual withdrawal wasn&rsquo;t effective until November 4th, 2020 and one of President Biden&rsquo;s first action after his inauguration was to rejoin the agreement.</p>

<p>At the center of the Paris Agreement are individual long-term goals set by the parties known as <em>nationally determined contributions</em>. Where President Obama submitted a target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, President Biden is expected to establish targets more consistent with his stated goal of achieving a carbon-free power sector by 2035 and net zero emissions economy-wide by 2050.</p>

<p>There are a number of different pathways towards reaching these goals, but the most straightforward method would be for Congress to pass legislation that caps carbon pollution and invests in clean alternatives. One possible model for this type of legislation was the Waxman-Markey Bill that was passed by the House in 2009 but was never brought up for a vote by the Senate. A modernized version of that bill reflecting the most current science and the Biden&rsquo;s administration&rsquo;s priorities could easily drive the sort of reductions we need.</p>

<p>That isn&rsquo;t the only legislative path of course. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, legislation related to the Green New Deal, and other alternatives could all lead to the needed emission reductions. Whether such bills would have enough support to overcome a filibuster in the Senate remains to be seen&mdash;polluting industries still wield considerable political power.</p>

<p>If the legislative pathway is blocked, the administration could use its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to get the needed emissions reductions. This is what the Obama administration did when it finalized its Clean Power Plan (CPP). In that case, existing fossil fuel power plants were required to meet certain standards of performance&mdash;the aforementioned BSER. This could be accomplished by installing new technology at the facilities themselves, but CPP also allowed states and regions to meet the standards in aggregate through programs like RGGI.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the eventual federal approach may not necessarily require states to implement a cap-and-invest system like Governor Wolf has proposed or join a multi-state effort such as RGGI, there are some good reasons for considering that pathway, even apart from preventing 188 million tons of carbon pollution, millions of dollars worth of co-benefits from other emissions reductions, and the potential for investment in clean and sustainable technologies that RGGI brings.</p>

<p>First, to the extent that we are required to meet federal emission targets, modeling indicates that multi-state compliance programs such as joining RGGI would likely be the most cost-effective means to do so. This should be obvious: instead of needing to reduce emissions at each individual plant, a trading program allows those reductions to be made wherever they are cheapest. A multi-state trading program provides a bigger pool of options, so finding a less-expensive alternative becomes more likely.</p>

<p>Having a strong federal program also mitigates another concern with RGGI&mdash;emissions leakage. We are very familiar with this concept in Pennsylvania where, as a member of Ozone Transport Region (OTR), facilities in our state sometimes need to meet more stringent rules than similar facilities in non-OTR states like Ohio. This gives some incentive for businesses to locate operations in jurisdictions where regulations and oversight are more lax.</p>

<p>As expected, modeling conducted on the proposed CO2 Cap and Invest program identified some effects of leakage. While CO2 pollution will fall across the board, emissions in Pennsylvania are expected to decline more than emissions in the grid as a whole&mdash;that indicates some limited shifting of generation to out of state companies could happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this were a very large effect, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s program could be adjusted to compensate for the problem. There is a better solution though&mdash;if&nbsp; the federal government requires other states to achieve similar emissions reductions as a result of the Biden administrations new targets, there will be no incentive for leakage.</p>

<p>Even though federal action is likely on the way, Pennsylvania can and should move forward with its own proposed CO2 Cap and Invest program without delay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, not only does this bring all the net benefits DEP identified that much sooner, it also puts Pennsylvania in a better position to influence the coming federal action. The Clean Air Act makes good use of a concept called &ldquo;cooperative federalism.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This, essentially, lets states innovate and tailor programs to best fit their needs while the federal government provides a strong backstop ensuring critical standards are met&nbsp; If we act now, there is a much greater chance the federal program will accommodate decisions we make in Pennsylvania. If we delay, we may cede some of that flexibility.</p>

Fracking Banned in Delaware River Basin,2/25/2021,"<p>After a decade of consideration and study, the Delaware River Basin Commission has finally banned hydraulic fracturing in the Delaware River Basin. This is a truly momentous step.</p>

<p>For the past decade, there has been <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Moratorium-on-Fracking-in-the-Delaware-River-Basin-is-Critical-to-Protect-Our-Water"">a de facto&nbsp;moratorium on fracking</a> in the Basin. The DRBC wrote draft regulations banning fracking in 2011 but held off on finalizing them, citing the need for more information on the potential harmful environmental impacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the intervening years, New York State prohibited fracking and issued a final environmental impact statement in 2015 detailing the significant risks fracking poses to water resources.&nbsp;In 2016, the US EPA published a report on the significant water and health impacts associated with fracking.&nbsp;In 2017, DRBC finally sent the draft regulations, which banned hydraulic fracturing and included regulations governing fracking-related interbasin water transfers and the treatment and disposal of fracking-related wastewater, out for public comment. More than&nbsp;8,900 comment submissions were received before the comment period closed in 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then another three years passed before the February 25, 2021 vote. The DRBC voted to approve the portions of the draft regulations banning fracking.&nbsp;It withdrew the draft regulations governing water transfers and wastewater treatment, and instead it plans to issue new draft regulations on these remaining fracking issues by the end of September 2021. This is exactly what <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Public-Comment-Closes-on-DRBC-Fracking-Regulations"">PennFuture called for in our 2018 comments</a> which argued that the regulations were not strong enough to protect the watershed.</p>

<p>In one way, the February 25, 2021 vote does not change the Basin&rsquo;s status, because the de facto moratorium had been in place since 2010, and a variety of legal proceedings since then had not shaken it loose.&nbsp;In other ways, the vote is critically important.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, it puts in place a permanent legal ban, which is far more secure than a de facto moratorium.&nbsp;Clear legal status benefits all stakeholders: landowners, water users, municipal governments, everyone who enjoys the water resources of the Delaware River Basin.&nbsp;Second, it sends a strong message from the governors of the four states in the compact - PA, NJ, NY, and DE - who all voted for the ban, that water quality really matters and industrial risks to water quality cannot be ignored.&nbsp;(The Biden administration representative abstained from the vote, saying that there had not been time to appropriately coordinate with the new administration and deferring to the votes of the member states.)</p>

<p>Importantly, today&rsquo;s vote does not put an end to all fracking issues in the Delaware River watershed.&nbsp;There will almost certainly be a legal challenge to the ban brought by pro-fracking advocates and industry, and that legal challenge will take time to work its way through the courts.&nbsp;In the meantime, the ban will be in place and the waters of the basin will be protected.&nbsp;Additionally, we will wait to see what the DRBC proposes regarding fracking-related interbasin water transfers and treatment and disposal of fracking wastewater.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we know, the fracked gas industry in Pennsylvania has a <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Setting-the-Record-Straight-About-Fracking-in-Pennsylvania"">long and infamous history of disrespecting our laws</a>, communities, shared resources and environment.&nbsp; PennFuture will carefully review the new regulations, when they are issued, to evaluate whether they are fully protective of water quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can rejoice in today&rsquo;s vote that protects water resources and public health from the dangers of fracking and know that we will remain vigilant against future threats to the environment and the people of the Delaware River basin.</p>

A Breath of Fresh Air: Two Steps (and Hopefully More) Forward on Environmental Justice and Water Protection,2/19/2021,"<p><em>The United States has transitioned to the new Biden Administration that offers a stark departure on national environmental policy that could have profound impacts on Pennsylvania. After years of handouts and rollbacks to polluters, the Biden Administration is offering a hopeful opportunity to restore protections for clean air and clean water. The new Administration is also presenting renewed vigor to tackle the biggest environmental challenges of our time: mitigating climate change, addressing inequality and environmental injustices, and advancing a national economy that creates good-paying jobs while not destroying our environment. In this blog series&mdash;A Breath of Fresh Air&mdash;PennFuture experts discuss their hope, opportunities, and uncertainty during this historic shift in national policy.</em></p>

<p>The Trump administration had rolled back over 100 different environmental rules, regulations, or policies &mdash;&nbsp;an exhausting catalog of actions entirely disregarding health and the environment.&nbsp;Simply undoing the rollbacks would be a start at putting us where we were four years ago. This start is just that &mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;a start.&nbsp;Environmentalists have much higher hopes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another entry in this blog series will focus on the issue of energy and the Clean Power Plan.&nbsp;Of course, given the magnitude and intersectional nature of the climate crisis, climate issues should overlay and interact with nearly everything the Biden administration does.&nbsp;So somewhat artificially setting aside federal energy policy and other more directly climate-focused issues, this post focuses on two areas &mdash;&nbsp;using environmental reviews to promote environmental justice and protection of clean water, on which the Biden administration has already started to undo the anti-environmental legacy of the past four years and where further progress is hopefully on its way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, the Trump administration had viewed the National Environmental Policy Act (&ldquo;NEPA&rdquo;), which requires review and consideration of impacts and alternatives for all major federal actions affecting human health and the environment, as nothing more than a roadblock to construction.&nbsp;The Biden administration has a chance to not only reinforce the review and public participation mandates of NEPA, but to use it to enshrine principles of environmental justice into law.&nbsp;Because many of the Trump-era rollbacks were done via executive order, President Biden can and indeed has already undone them in the same manner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/"">President Biden revoked Trump-era executive orders</a> which eliminated federal guidance on review of greenhouse gas emissions and directed federal agencies to rescind the parts of their review processes that allegedly might impede energy production, particularly from oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy resources.&nbsp;He also revoked an order which imposed an unrealistic two-year completion date for all environmental impact statements regardless of the nature or complexity of the project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Biden&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/"">executive order also directs</a> the Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Management and Budget to &ldquo;take steps&rdquo; toward ensuring that federal infrastructure investment reduces climate pollution, requiring federal permitting decisions to consider the effects of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and accelerating the deployment of clean energy and transmission projects.</p>

<p>NEPA, and its mandate for review and consideration of impacts,&nbsp;provides a legal opportunity to center environmental justice considerations and evaluate the impacts of proposed development on communities &mdash;&nbsp;including communities of color and tribal communities &mdash;&nbsp;that are already disproportionately bearing environmental burdens. President Biden has created within the Council for Environmental Quality, the office responsible for NEPA, the position of senior director for environmental justice <a href=""https://aldianews.com/articles/politics/joe-biden-adds-environmental-trailblazer-cecilia-martinez-his-climate-team/62115"">and has appointed Cecilia Martinez</a>, an environmental justice expert and advocate.&nbsp; Using NEPA and the CEQ is one method; advocates should continue to push the Biden administration to incorporate environmental justice considerations into decision-making throughout government.</p>

<p>Second, one of President Biden&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/?fbclid=IwAR2RHPxkppcPEFTkwki83rQ0EMKVmWlFxLACGNfNbBnQN4rmbeL4D8iu98c"">first day executive orders covers</a> the Trump Dirty Water Rule (otherwise known as the &ldquo;Navigable Waters Protection Rule&rdquo;).&nbsp;The Dirty Water Rule <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Submits-Comments-Opposing-the-Dirty-Water-Rule-Engages-More-Than-1400-Citizens-to-Do-the-Same"">was one of the largest rollbacks</a> of Clean Water Act protections in history and removed federal jurisdiction over an enormous amount of waterways and wetlands.&nbsp;The Dirty Water Rule was a rollback of the Waters of the United States rule, which had expanded and clarified federal jurisdiction over many of those same waterways, enacted during President Obama&rsquo;s term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Dirty Water Rule was finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency and became law in 2020.&nbsp;Principles of administrative law mean that new leadership at the EPA can&rsquo;t simply undo the Dirty Waters Rule without a new rulemaking; instead, President Biden announced that the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers (both of which have responsibility for administering the regulation) will review the rule, presumably in preparation for enacting an entirely new regulation.</p>

<p>The Dirty Water Rule is also being challenged through litigation; if a court invalidates the rule or sends it back to the EPA for further consideration, then that also provides an opportunity for the Biden EPA to essentially start again.&nbsp;Expanded federal jurisdiction over waters and wetlands is essential to consistent protection of waters as well as consistency for stakeholders regarding what rules apply.&nbsp;It is inevitable that any action by the Biden EPA will be challenged in court, and so this is an issue to which environmentalists must keep paying close attention and continue to speak up for protection of our waters.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to take our laws back to where they were before - environmental justice and protection of clean water requires that we take the opportunity to move forward towards a cleaner and healthier environment for all.</p>

A Breath of Fresh Air: Reason for Optimism for Lake Erie,2/12/2021,"<p>Great Lakes communities have reason for optimism under the new Biden administration. Among the many issues the administration plans to tackle are climate change, racial inequities, and aging infrastructure. Bipartisan interest in infrastructure upgrades across the U.S. is especially encouraging because these investments will not only generate family-sustaining jobs but they can also launch the U.S. into a cleaner and more resilient future.</p>

<p>The Great Lakes are the largest surface freshwater system in the world and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Erie County runs along the southern border of Lake Erie. Lake Erie has already seen increased harmful algal blooms and decreased ice coverage over the past few decades. Erie was also named as the 8th fastest warming city in the country <a href=""https://www.climatecentral.org/news/report-american-warming-us-heats-up-earth-day"">by Climate Central.</a> Climatic changes in this region will have far reaching effects given the importance of tourism, fishing, and agriculture to the region&rsquo;s economy. These impacts include longer growing seasons but increased frequencies of drought and flood conditions, as well as increased incidences of <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/climate-change-and-harmful-algal-blooms"">harmful algal blooms</a> and <a href=""https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/invasive-alien-species-and-climate-change"">invasive species</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Biden administration&rsquo;s quick, decisive actions and <a href=""https://www.pri.org/stories/2021-02-10/biden-vows-take-whole-government-approach-climate-change"">&ldquo;whole government approach&rdquo;</a> have the potential to put the United States back on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, upgrade infrastructure to make it more energy efficient, and put us on track for a more sustainable future. Efforts toward energy efficiency and renewable energy are likely to continue Pennsylvania&rsquo;s trend, with <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/08/20/report-clean-energy-jobs-among-fastest-growing-in-state-from-2017-2019/"">clean energy jobs among the fastest growing</a> in the state. Additionally, efforts to make homes more energy efficient will lower energy bills, which will have increased positive impact on low-income families who <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/01/f58/WIP-Energy-Burden_final.pdf"">pay a larger portion of their income toward energy bills</a> than families with higher incomes.</p>

<p>The Biden administration also promises to upgrade America&rsquo;s infrastructure, including everything from roads to drinking water supply. This would be a major boon for Great Lakes regional economies, marginalized communities, and the environment if conducted in an equitable, sustainable manner. Biden&rsquo;s Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, recognized that &ldquo;misguided policies can reinforce racial inequities&rdquo; as has been demonstrated <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/defeating-the-legacy-of-highways-rammed-through-poor-neighborhoods/2016/03/28/ffcfb5ae-f2a1-11e5-a61f-e9c95c06edca_story.html"">in highway projects across the country.</a> Having someone in office who understands this is a step in the right direction that will hopefully trickle down into more equitable transportation decision-making.</p>

<p>Among the infrastructure upgrades that we hope to see are more natural and nature-based stormwater projects, also called <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/what-is-green-stormwater-infrastructure"">green stormwater infrastructure.</a> These features are often overlooked when municipalities develop plans to upgrade stormwater and address flooding issues, but they have been shown to be as effective and less expensive than traditional stormwater infrastructure.</p>

<p>They also have added benefits like adding green space, providing habitat for native flora and fauna, filtering water pollutants, slowing runoff, and sequestering carbon dioxide. If implemented on a broad scale, these green stormwater features can help protect and restore water quality across the Great Lakes and make communities more resilient to extreme precipitation events and flooding that are <a href=""https://toolkit.climate.gov/regions/great-lakes"">already increasing due to climate change.</a></p>

<p>The new administration&rsquo;s plans are ambitious, which is exactly what this country needs right now to pull us out of the economic recession and job loss caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We need strong action to address racial inequities that have always existed but have received renewed attention due to the social unrest that came from the unnecessary deaths of several Black Americans in 2020. We also saw that people of color have experienced disproportionate impacts from the pandemic, further highlighting the need for action. President Biden has already put together <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/president-biden-takes-office/2021/02/05/963837953/biden-pledged-historic-cabinet-diversity-heres-how-his-nominees-stack-up"">a diverse cabinet</a> and issued <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2021/01/29/956012329/hope-and-skepticism-as-biden-promises-to-address-environmental-racism"">an executive order to address environmental racism</a>, both of which are promising steps toward more equitable federal policies.</p>

<p>While there is much to be celebrated at the beginning of this new administration, there is much work to be done and a divided nation to heal. No administration can accomplish everything they set out to do but this one is off to a good start. Hopefully, local momentum for better inclusion and more equitable policies will add to the federal initiatives and move the country toward a more prosperous, sustainable, and equitable future for everyone and a vibrant future for the Great Lakes region.</p>

<br />
The first week of President Biden&rsquo;s administration galvanized conservationists, environmentalists, and environmental justice activists.&nbsp;With the stroke of a pen, the federal government promised to champion science and prioritize climate change.&nbsp;Ultimately, the series of executive orders signed by President Biden that focused on the environment renewed faith in a system that, for four years, seemed bent on careening us towards climate catastrophe.&nbsp;Many of us breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Organizers and activists are exhausted.&nbsp;Playing defense against an anti-environment juggernaut for four years left us burned out.&nbsp;So, it&rsquo;s only natural for us to take a break and let the new administration take over for a while.&nbsp;And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid of: relinquishing control is not strategy; it is desperation.</p>

<p>Instead, organizers and activists need to expand our reach and deepen relationships throughout our communities. We need to escape our echo chambers.&nbsp;We need to form coalitions and build networks of communication.&nbsp;White-led organizations and coalitions need to share power.&nbsp;We need to develop alliances with the working class.&nbsp;This is not the time for rest.&nbsp;We have work to do.</p>

<p>In order to successfully build coalitions across class lines, we need a message that puts an end to the division between labor and the environment.&nbsp;Mining, drilling, processing, and pipeline jobs won&rsquo;t just disappear into the ether.&nbsp;A parallel economy - the Green Economy - is emerging.&nbsp;As we transition to renewables, opportunities for labor will abound.&nbsp;Yes, the jobs - and the skills necessary to perform them - will be different.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Training will be required.&nbsp;But there will be opportunities for labor.&nbsp;And they will likely be safer and healthier for workers, communities, and the planet.&nbsp;In a state where some legislators consistently ignore science and pit labor against the environment, I believe that a change in the national conversation may very well - dare I say trickle down - to the local level.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been here before with coal, an industry dying before our eyes, still refusing to fade away in favor of cleaner, renewable options.&nbsp;Now, we&rsquo;re forced to witness the end of the fracked gas industry, only a couple of decades after it ripped through our mountains, poisoned our streams, and destroyed our infrastructure.&nbsp;It is time to break the cycle of environmental abuse levied upon this state by the fossil fuel industry in all of its iterations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have the opportunity to rise up as a leader in renewable energy and lift up the working class which has kept the lights on for so long by serving in the mines, gas fields, and oil refineries.&nbsp;It is time to give back by providing new jobs, skills, and opportunities.&nbsp;As the new administration says, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/30/joe-biden-climate-change-action?fbclid=IwAR0iPREAzsjbRwQILFKGtHFZgIfQjvsrcLSZiRhPDguxD72josjUozCcA1M"">&ldquo;When I think of climate change I think of jobs.&rdquo;</a>&nbsp; Organizers at the local level need to embrace that slogan.</p>

<p>It is up to us to build the relationships necessary to see each other as partners, not as adversaries. It is up to us to agree that the climate crisis is worthy enough a foe to link arms.&nbsp;It is up to us to fight for the future of our families, communities, country, and planet instead of political points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Pennsylvanians could agree that the environment is one of the most salient issues in our commonwealth, consider the injustices we could confront:&nbsp;environmental racism, the death of the fossil fuel industry that left behind workers whose ancestors kept the lights on for generations, the failing health of our nation caused by pollution and environmental degradation.&nbsp;As organizers, it is up to us to lay the groundwork for progress.</p>

<p>The advent of a new administration does not allow for rest; in contrast, it demands a kind of sortie.&nbsp;Environmentalists, conservationists, and EJ activists must now go on the offensive.&nbsp; It is time to battle for the future. We&rsquo;ve got the opportunity to make real, tangible progress if we coalesce and fight. We can&rsquo;t afford to waste it.</p>

A Welcomed Shift in Philadelphia’s Approach to Infrastructure Financing,2/2/2021,"<p>Last month Governor Wolf <a href=""https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/Pennvest-details.aspx?newsid=61"">announced $178 million in investments</a> for water infrastructure projects in 11 counties with funds from <a href=""https://www.pennvest.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx"">Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Infrastructure Investment Fund (PENNVEST)</a>. Philadelphia received the largest award of any applicant: $106 million of the investments will contribute to the goals of the <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> program - the city&rsquo;s combined sewer overflow compliance program. The announcement represents a welcomed shift in the city&rsquo;s approach to infrastructure financing, and one we&rsquo;d like to see the water department utilize more in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PENNVEST is a low-cost financing program that provides assistance to the communities and citizens of Pennsylvania by funding sewer, stormwater and drinking water projects. PENNVEST was established in 1988 through the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority Act to administer and finance federal programs known as the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF), the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF), and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). CWSRF and DWSRF were established as part of the Water Quality Act of 1987. PENNVEST also finances, through the issuance of special obligation revenue bonds, water management, solid waste disposal, sewage treatment and pollution control projects undertaken by or on behalf of private entities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, concerns have arisen from within the water department about the rising cost of Philadelphia&rsquo;s <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> program, which is financed by&nbsp;a stormwater charge on water rates and taxpayer dollars. PENNVEST provides municipalities with a low interest rate alternative to pursuing financing through the private market. This allows for municipalities to avoid having to make large increases to water rates or taxes to finance their water infrastructure investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2019 PennFuture, along with partners at Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia, Natural Resources Defense Council, Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, and Friends of the Wissahickon, released <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/common-agenda"">A Common Green Stormwater Infrastructure Agenda for Philadelphia</a>.&nbsp;The Common Agenda offered a series of recommended policy solutions for Philadelphia&rsquo;s Mayor and City Council to consider to ensure the long term success of <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em>.</p>

<p>One recommended solution is that the city &ldquo;take full advantage of all available state and federal programs that provide grants and low-cost financing for municipal infrastructure improvement. This includes programs like PENNVEST&rsquo;s Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which are specifically for water infrastructure, as well as programs focused on transportation, community development, or other projects that can be leveraged to include GSI improvements.&rdquo; (The Common Agenda, Pg. 12).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>PENNVEST funding is offered to a variety of programs, including <a href=""https://www.pennvest.pa.gov/Information/Funding-Programs/Pages/Green-Initiatives.aspx"">green initiatives that promote and encourage environmental responsibility</a> in communities that are creative and innovative with green solutions for water quality management. The Philadelphia Water Department was awarded PENNVEST funding for two projects. Both projects will contribute to cleaner streams and rivers in Philadelphia and maintain an affordable water rate for ratepayers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A portion of the PENNVEST award <a href=""https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/534811498/tartaglione-announces-6-7-million-in-state-financing-to-reduce-wastewater-overflows-in-lawncrest"">will provide $6.7 million in green investments</a> in the Lawncrest neighborhood of lower Northeast Philadelphia. These green infrastructure projects include tree trenches, bumpouts, and stormwater trees that will reduce the quantity of stormwater pollution entering the streams and rivers surrounding Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The neighborhood of Lawncrest is also considered an Environmental Justice (EJ) Area. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection defines an EJ Area as &ldquo;any census tract where 20 percent or more individuals live at or below the federal poverty level and/or 30 percent or more of the population identifies as a non-white minority, based on data for the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal guidelines for poverty.&rdquo; In addition to reducing stormwater pollution and greening the neighborhood, this green investment will contribute to cooling the neighborhood and reversing the Urban Heat Island effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Philadelphia also received <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/pennsylvania-philadelphia-water-department-sewer-loan-upgrade-northeast-plant-20210126.html"">a $100 million loan to construct</a> a preliminary treatment facility. The facility will reroute wastewater from entering the combined sewer system and install new screening and grit removal systems. The project will have the capacity to treat 300 million gallons per day and will reduce the amount of combined sewer overflows entering the Delaware River. Both of these significant infrastructure investments will contribute to the <em>Green City, Clean Waters&rsquo;</em> goal to reduce the amount of polluted stormwater overflows discharging into the creeks, streams, and rivers in and around Philadelphia by 85 percent by 2036.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s refreshing to see the Philadelphia Water Department pursue innovative approaches towards financing and fixing very old issues with the city&rsquo;s aging infrastructure. <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> was an innovative and unique solution to combined sewer overflow pollution. The program put Philadelphia on the map as a national leader in green infrastructure. And now, as the program reaches its 10 year anniversary amidst a global pandemic, Philadelphia must once again demonstrate innovation and leadership in stormwater infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture joins with the Philadelphia Coalition for Affordable Communities,1/26/2021,"<p>At the start of 2021, PennFuture became an official member of the <a href=""http://phillyaffordablecommunities.org/"">Philadelphia Coalition for Affordable Communities</a>. The coalition, led by the <a href=""https://www.wcrpphila.org/"">Women&rsquo;s Community Revitalization Project</a>,&nbsp;launched in 2005 through the &ldquo;Development without Displacement&rdquo; campaign to ensure that as the city&rsquo;s neighborhoods recover and thrive, individuals and families from all income levels benefit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, the coalition has been advocating for better policies, more funding and more land for affordable housing, as well as funding for childcare and resources to address community needs. These campaigns have resulted in notable victories including the creation of the Philadelphia Housing Trust Fund, The Land Bank, and funding for affordable housing. This year the coalition will be launching its Land Justice Campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are proud to join the coalition in striving for increased land justice and affordable housing. Our Philadelphia work is focused on elevating nature-based solutions to stormwater pollution by elevating the importance of green stormwater infrastructure and the preservation and increase of green space with elected officials and communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Philadelphia&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/water/sustainability/greencitycleanwaters/Pages/default.aspx""><em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> program</a> has put the city on the map for being the first city in the country to implement green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) at a citywide scale to reduce stormwater pollution. To date, Philadelphia has constructed 1,000 greened acres (a good start in reaching their goal of 10,000 greened acres by 2036) that are reducing stormwater pollution and resulting in cleaner water in our local rivers and streams. But even before the city&rsquo;s <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> program, communities and residents were reducing stormwater pollution by preserving land for community gardens and open space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> was first initiated, Philadelphia was still struggling to recover from decades of declining population and urban blight. The program was chosen, in part, because of the co-benefits associated with greening neighborhoods intended to address many of the intersecting crises. It was also the most cost-effective. Philadelphia was facing, and continues to struggle with today, gun violence, blight, the urban heat island effect, poverty, and job loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Green City, Clean Waters</em> has had many successes over the years. To date, <a href=""https://gsipartners.sbnphiladelphia.org/the-economic-social-and-environmental-case-for-green-city-clean-waters-an-update/"">the program is producing $4 billion in total economic impact for Philadelphia</a>, including an average of 1,160 jobs annually. In 2018 the program reduced crime by nearly nine percent and saved the city $50 million annually in avoided health-related costs attributed to access to open space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, nearly ten years after the initial launch of <em>Green City, Clean Waters</em>, Philadelphia is a different kind of city. Philadelphia is becoming a more desirable place to live. Development has increased in many neighborhoods and property values are rising. But these improvements have also had some negative impacts on our communities. As affordable, accessible homes are becoming out of reach for most Philadelphians, community open spaces and gardens are quickly being lost to profit-driven development. Community gardens and farms have been places where people gather, sources of affordable nutrition, and naturally manage stormwater.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this development is critical for improving Philadelphia&rsquo;s neighborhoods and the construction of private green stormwater infrastructure projects, for many Philadelphians who have been preserving open space and investing in their communities for years, it means being forced out of their communities. Preserving housing and land affordability in gentrifying neighborhoods will ensure that those who are committed to and invested in Philadelphia&rsquo;s communities can afford to stay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Thursday, PennFuture will join the Philadelphia Coalition for Affordable Housing as it launches the Land Justice Campaign, which seeks to address the city&rsquo;s housing and food affordability crises by transfering city owned vacant land to groups that will put the land back to use and ensure permanent affordability and community control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The campaign intends to expand opportunities to create Community Land Trusts (CLTs) within the city. CLTs are nonprofit, community-based organizations that are committed to permanent stewardship of land and the permanent affordability of housing and other uses upon its lands. They are one way to achieve permanent accessible affordable and community control in neighborhoods facing displacement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are proud to stand among the members of the coalition in seeking community-led solutions to Philadelphia&rsquo;s affordability and land justice challenges.&nbsp;</p>

A Breath of Fresh Air,1/22/2021,"<p><em>The United States has transitioned to the new Biden Administration that offers a stark departure on national environmental policy that could have profound impacts on Pennsylvania. After years of handouts and rollbacks to polluters, the Biden Administration is offering a hopeful opportunity to restore protections for clean air and clean water. The new Administration is also presenting renewed vigor to tackle the biggest environmental challenges of our time: mitigating climate change, addressing inequality and environmental injustices, and advancing a national economy that creates good-paying jobs while not destroying our environment. In this blog series&mdash;A Breath of Fresh Air&mdash;PennFuture experts discuss their hope, opportunities, and uncertainty during this historic shift in national policy.</em></p>

<p>Rejoining the Paris climate accord. Cancelling permits for the Keystone XL Pipeline. A commitment to reverse or reinstate an astounding number of environmental rollbacks and repeals from the prior administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And that was just Day 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Joseph Biden hasn&rsquo;t been shy about his determination to tackle one of the most pressing issues of our time. Speaking from the Oval Office on his first night as president, Biden said his administration will <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/climate/biden-paris-climate-agreement.html"">&ldquo;combat climate change in a way we have not before.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Though Biden&rsquo;s actions will ultimately speak louder than his words, his first day in office was already a stark departure from the deregulation and polluter-first policies of the Trump administration, which repealed or otherwise rolled back more than 100 environmental rules and regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In case you needed a reminder, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html"">the numbers are staggering</a>: 30 rule reversals for air pollution, 19 on drilling and extraction, 16 for protecting wildlife and animals, and 9 for water pollution, among others. All told, 112 rules meant to keep us, our environment, and living species safe from pollution and degradation, wiped off the books or watered down over the last four years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump didn&rsquo;t stop at deregulation. The former president, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/"">who claimed the climate crisis was a hoax concocted by China</a> to weaken America&rsquo;s manufacturing sector, rushed during the dying days of his presidency <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-drilling-idUSKBN29O2K5"">to auction off drilling rights for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a>, and to weaken <a href=""https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/535106-biden-freeze-of-trump-rules-could-halt-environmental-rollbacks"">a 100-year-old law that protects migratory birds.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Put simply, most in the environmental advocacy world believe that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/21/trump-environmental-protections-rollback-climate-crisis"">&ldquo;no administration has been worse for our environment or our nation&rsquo;s public health than this one,&rdquo;</a> and it&rsquo;s hard to argue to the contrary. On Friday, the New York Times estimated it <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/climate/biden-environment.html"">could take years for Biden to reverse the damage done </a>by the previous administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At PennFuture, we don&rsquo;t favor one political party over another. We favor science, sound environmental policy, and anything that gets us closer to a clean energy economy and a healthy, stable climate. Anything less from either side of the political spectrum is unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With that said, it&rsquo;s hard not to feel optimistic on the dawn of this new administration. Even while running for president, Biden&rsquo;s platform <a href=""https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/look-biden-s-climate-and-environment-roster"">included the most ambitious climate action plan in history</a>, with a needed and dedicated focus on environmental justice issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since being elected in November, Biden has unveiled a climate-first cabinet <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biden-names-john-kerry-climate-envoy/"">and even created a new position</a> in nominating former Secretary of State John Kerry as a &ldquo;special presidential envoy on climate change.&rdquo; He also tapped Obama-era EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to start a new White House office on climate policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the New York Times, Biden is building a veritable &ldquo;nerve center&rdquo; for climate issues and is overseeing <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/climate/biden-climate-change.html"">&ldquo;the largest team of climate change experts ever assembled in the White House.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>So on this, the second full day of a new administration, we are hopeful for a new era, but we are not yet satisfied or content. We are eager to see what comes next, and how PennFuture might engage with or otherwise work alongside this new administration to advance commonsense policies and regulations that bring us closer to a world without a climate crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At minimum, this new administration is a breath of fresh air, but time will tell as to its true impact on the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the climate we all rely on for survival.&nbsp;</p>

In the Midst of a Democracy Emergency,1/19/2021,"<p>The United States, and by extension Pennsylvania, is in the midst of a democracy emergency.</p>

<p>Our public institutions are weak, the image of a stable American republic is in tatters, and basic tenets of our constitution&mdash;the ability for all citizens to freely vote, for those votes to be fairly counted, and results of the election to lead to a peaceful transition of power&mdash;has been undermined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While PennFuture remains, first and foremost, a beacon for environmental leadership and protection in Pennsylvania, we would not be true to our mission if we didn&rsquo;t stand up and emphatically oppose efforts to undercut the democracy we require to ensure clean air, clean water, abundant green spaces, and a stable climate. We stand with all of civil society against the violent sedition, conspiracy theories, and fomenting of hate that has gripped our communities and politics.</p>

<p>PennFuture has now <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/insurrectionaction"">weighed in against elected officials</a> who have breached the trust of the people.&nbsp;Elected officials in our state <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/mastrianoalert"">are propagating and participating in the lie</a> that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s November 2020 election was fraudulent. President Donald Trump has taken that lie to the point of inciting riot, mayhem and insurrection against American Democracy on January 6, 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we crafted <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-statement-regarding-violent-insurrection-at-US-Capitol"">our media statement</a> around the insurrection, we knew the statement would be different, and the focus would be different, because this moment in time is one of the most appalling and dangerous in our history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This moment also lays bare the interconnectedness of our frail democracy with the systemic environmental injustices holding back countless communities around the Commonwealth. The gross racial double standard applied by law enforcement was egregiously on display on January 6.&nbsp; So was the evidence of white supremacists among President Trump&rsquo;s supporters, and the overtly racist aspects of Trump&#39;s doctrine of &ldquo;American Carnage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trauma felt by people of color in the aftermath of January 6, simply put, cannot be shared by white America.&nbsp;People of color in this country have not lived the same American experience lived by whites because this country&rsquo;s original sin of slavery, inequality and race relations still have not been reckoned with.&nbsp;Now we endeavor to attempt that reckoning, and January 6 is the latest manifestation of how hard this will and needs to be. We must try harder to open and hold fast to a space for people of color to speak in this moment.</p>

<p>Our country is balancing on a razor edge.&nbsp;On one side is unity; on the other side is violence, and deeper division. Since the November election, I have struggled with the question of how PennFuture can do its work in a state so deeply divided.&nbsp;Racism divides us, and we are taking imperfect steps as an organization to deal with this. The partisan divide is fueling so many problems and we are grateful that many lawmakers talk to us and listen to our concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is an urban and rural divide.&nbsp;Over the years, I have done a lot of conservation work in more rural communities of our state.&nbsp;I know at one time there were strongly held and shared values around land, air, water and wildlife across the political and geographic spectrum&mdash; will we ever share those values again?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also a divide between what our state Constitution says and how it is&nbsp;carried out by elected officials, residents, and corporations. Our mission is tethered to the Pennsylvania Constitution, specifically Article 1, Section 27, the Environmental Rights Amendment that states:</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.&nbsp;Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come.&nbsp;As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.</em></p>

<p>Bluntly, we have made little progress in ensuring this guarantee is the law of the land.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s theory of change relies on the state and nation having in place a majority of elected officials who are pro-environment and who share that value with our organization.&nbsp;For those majorities to occur, our values as an organization need to be shared with voters, participating in an intact democracy.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s Civic Engagement program&mdash;<a href=""https://www.democracyforall-pennfuture.com/"">Democracy for All</a>&mdash;reaches out to those voters or those eligible to vote and endeavors to open our organization to those voices, particularly in communities of color, but the trust gap is real.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The democracy emergency is real; fraught race relations are real; so is the climate emergency, and the public health emergency in our communities unjustly burdened with pollution. As the country transitions from an unapologetically anti-environmental and anti-regulatory administration to the Biden administration, one that blessedly already is taking major steps to affirm the seriousness of global climate change and the need to transition without further delay to a cleaner energy, you can expect PennFuture to continue to speak up about these interconnected emergencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a personal note, as a lifelong activist, silence from the advocacy organization I came to lead was not an option after January 6.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve offered my assurance about our mission, and rationale about why we must focus where we are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, it must be said that we act because it is simply the right thing to do.</p>

The Growing Danger of Pipelines Our Safety Regulations Overlook,1/6/2021,"<p>In a November 2019 presentation, John Gale, Director of Standards and Rulemaking at the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), called gathering lines <a href=""http://pstrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Gale-Presentation.pdf"">&ldquo;the next big thing&rdquo; in pipeline safety</a>. This certainly rings true in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After just one week in operation, Energy Transfer&rsquo;s 24-inch diameter gathering pipeline ruptured and exploded in Beaver County, taking down a nearby house, six transmission towers, and multiple motor vehicles and burning several acres of trees. Residents of 49 households were forced to evacuate in the 2018 explosion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By June 2020, Attorney General Josh Shapiro had released a scathing report on the state&rsquo;s failure to protect its citizens during the fracking boom. The report had eight recommendations, and the regulation of gathering pipelines was third on the list.</p>

<p>As the report describes, the emergence of fracking dramatically upended the gas industry, swiftly rendering decades of regulations insufficient.&nbsp;The failed regulation of gathering pipelines provides a blistering example.</p>

<p>Gas pipelines are broken into three main categories: gathering lines, which transport extracted gas to be processed and treated; transmission lines, which transport processed gas over long distances; and distribution lines, which deliver processed gas to homes and businesses. The PHMSA sets minimum regulations for pipelines and certifies state agents &ndash; usually the Public Utility Commission &ndash; for enforcement.</p>

<p>While transmission and distribution lines are generally held to higher standards, gathering lines are subject to a patchwork of regulations that leaves an estimated 439,000 miles of pipelines &ndash; which, end to end, would wrap around the Earth 17 times &ndash; essentially unregulated. These pipelines do not have to be built to standard, marked, or regularly inspected, a regulatory scheme that was devised when gathering lines were considered lower risk because of their comparatively smaller diameter and lower pressure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet with a dramatic increase in production and more gas to transport, fracked gas companies now operate much larger gathering pipelines under higher pressures. In many instances, these pipelines are indistinguishable from transmission lines, despite being subject to far fewer safety regulations.</p>

<p>In fact, which regulations apply to gathering lines depend upon both the population density of the surrounding area - a factor which is subject to change over time - and its operating pressure. These confusing standards undervalue the safety of rural residents, preclude community involvement, and complicate enforcement. They also mean that about 95 percent of gathering pipelines in Pennsylvania are not subject to any federal or state safety regulations.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania needs to streamline and extend its pipeline safety standards by regulating all gathering lines just as we would transmission lines. This means that pipeline companies would be held to a common standard for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of all gathering lines, regardless of their location.</p>

<p>Gathering lines in urban areas (Class 4 locations) are already subject to most of these rules. This change would extend these safety regulations to pipelines in less densely populated areas, affording peri-urban and rural residents the same level of protection from potential pipeline incidents while simplifying enforcement.</p>

<p>Regulating gathering pipelines is not the only action necessary to modernize our outdated pipeline safety regulations, but it&rsquo;s an important first step.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 90 percent of voters in Pennsylvania want lawmakers to take the necessary steps to prevent pipeline accidents. We must urge the General Assembly to heed the Attorney General&rsquo;s recommendations and the expressed concerns of voters across the state by regulating all gathering lines exactly as we would transmission lines.</p>

Recycling is Exacerbating the Plastic Waste Crisis,1/4/2021,"<p>On November 25th, 2020, Pennsylvania became the ninth state in the nation to pass <a href=""https://nextpittsburgh.com/latest-news/the-advanced-recycling-bill-just-passed-by-the-pa-house-would-harm-the-environment-says-new-report-heres-why/"">so-called &ldquo;advanced recycling&rdquo; legislation</a>.</p>

<p>Coined by the American Chemistry Council, the term encompasses processes that transform plastic waste into their component parts using heat and pressure. Because 99 percent of all plastics are made from oil and fracked gas, the resulting product is most often a fossil fuel.</p>

<p>The legislation redefines plastic-to-fuel operations as &ldquo;recycling&rdquo; under state solid waste law, loosening regulations for plastic-burning businesses and potentially paving the way for them to take advantage of future clean energy funding. All this bodes poorly for the residents of Pennsylvania, who can expect more air pollution and an increased reliance on single-use plastic.</p>

<p>The nascent industry is already descending upon our state, using Pennsylvania residents as guinea pigs as they test out new methods and processes. International Recycling Group <a href=""https://www.goerie.com/story/business/2020/08/17/100-million-recycling-plant-planned-for-erie/113341576/"">is planning to sort and process &ldquo;recycled&rdquo; plastics in Erie County</a> for use as a fuel and reactant in the steel-making process. Meanwhile, Agilyx Corporation <a href=""https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/agilyx-delta-air-monroe-plastic-scrap-fuel/"">has plans to revert &ldquo;recycled&rdquo; plastics into jet fuel</a> for Delta Airlines, expanding a petrochemical hub in an already overburdened community outside of Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we advance the number and types of products we can make from waste plastics, this project marks the first truly commercial-scale facility that will advance the new plastics economy,&rdquo;&nbsp; says Agilyx CEO Joe Vaillancourt.</p>

<p>Advanced recycling builds upon a decades-long crusade by the oil and gas industry to undermine the effectiveness of recycling. As public skepticism of plastic started turning into local bans on non-recyclable plastics in the 80s and 90s, the oil and gas industry realized that they had to <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/822597631/plastic-wars-three-takeaways-from-the-fight-over-the-future-of-plastics"">buy the public&rsquo;s trust in recycling</a> to keep plastic in the marketplace.</p>

<p>Yet an effective recycling system would be at odds with the industry, which <a href=""https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2020/09/13/381750/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled/"">makes $400 billion each year</a> turning fossil fuels into virgin plastics. So while they spent millions of dollars on ads and public relations campaigns to promote recycling, they also quietly celebrated the fact that low-quality recycled plastics could never compete with virgin plastics made from cheap oil and gas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, the oil and gas industry is taking our trust - our carefully cleaned and sorted plastic recyclables - and burning it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Advanced recycling businesses will come to rely upon single-use plastics as feedstock, further aiding oil and gas companies in their ultimate goal of <a href=""https://e360.yale.edu/features/the-plastics-pipeline-a-surge-of-new-production-is-on-the-way"">ramping up plastic production by threefold</a> in the next 30 years.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania will bear the brunt of this too. We have an overabundance of fracked gas - so much so that industry executives were <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2020/12/29/pennsylvania-rig-count-2020.html?ana=e_me_prem&amp;j=90544016&amp;t=Morning&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT1Raa056WXpOV1k1WVdGaCIsInQiOiJVUFc5RUtUZitaWXFmZ2tJZG9YazM4bkNJV3RTWE9CMlFxTUliMlN2clBveEtHVkNsNDBNaWh4c0dDZU1DOW1QK3RaczF6a2x5Nmt5NWZKeVpvbFh2VEM2SzNGMjR5NjZ3eWpjZlRwaG4xXC9La0dvcUFtRkhKMnJWUUZ1UUN2bDRwQzhyVzVzamFEVFRhOHg0cmZEZ2pnPT0ifQ%3D%3D"">forced to curb production this year</a>. Eager to find a use for their unwanted product, elected officials are doling out billions of taxpayer dollars to attract companies that would convert Pennsylvania fracked gas into petrochemicals like plastics and fertilizers. Shell was the first company <a href=""https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/shell-cracks-pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-tax-code"">to cash in on the prize</a>. They will not necessarily be the last.</p>

<p>More fracking, more plastic production, more plastic burning. Is this the solution to our plastics waste crisis?</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t need more recycling; we need less plastic. We must let go of our trust in the dysfunctional recycling system and any techno-solutions the plastics industry has to offer, and instead refocus our energy on holding oil and gas companies accountable for their irresponsible production, corporate greenwashing campaigns, and continual attempts to stop meaningful legislation in its tracks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transitioning Pennsylvania to a clean energy economy is one of our top priorities, and so-called &ldquo;advanced recycling&rdquo; won&rsquo;t do anything to get us closer to that goal. PennFuture will closely monitor this emerging industry in 2021, as well as projects already being discussed near Philadelphia and Erie.</p>

Ready for 2021,12/28/2020,"<p>Early on in 2020, even after a very successful mid-March rally against petrochemical subsidies in the state Capitol that was organized by the PennFuture team and supported by many partners, the pandemic and recession gave me serious doubts that PennFuture would be able to carry on our mission, let alone remain an essential force for environmental protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I reflect on the past and difficult year, that feeling couldn&rsquo;t have been further from what actually transpired &ndash; PennFuture distinguished itself as unparalleled in statewide environmental advocacy.</p>

<p>Sure, the fact that the legislature remained in session, and was sufficiently emboldened to attempt many bad things, helped, and cemented PennFuture&rsquo;s essential role in 2020 as a watchdog of the legislature and of polluters.&nbsp; But we also did so much more: defeated over 50 bad pieces of legislation designed to roll back previously hard-won environmental protections; seven legal actions taken; three major policy reports published; a virtual campaign to protect Pocono headwater streams that yielded almost 2 million social media posts and advocate-produced video content; and 800,000 voters or prospective voters civically engaged.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Our communications output was exhaustive: literally hundreds of media placements; the production of 15 issues of our lockdown inspired early-warning publication &quot;The Bark&quot;;&nbsp;and a full on counter-offensive of published content countering&nbsp;the many false narratives the fracked gas, petrochemical&nbsp;and plastics industries spew regularly.</p>

<p>The year wasn&rsquo;t without its extreme difficulties.&nbsp;The ongoing racism so brutally exposed by Black Lives Matters; the health end economic disparities exacted upon communities of color by COVID and its recession; the attempted robbery of the presidential election; and the deep divisions that define us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So 2021 must be a year to grapple with these realities, while we seek ways to reset society&rsquo;s desire for clean air, water and a healthy climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say enough about the extraordinary talent, energy and commitment of our staff team and the long list of great work not mentioned here.&nbsp;We are fortunate to have the encouragement and good counsel provided by our board of volunteer&nbsp;leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the help of readers, advocates and supporters like all of you, when 2021 arrives, PennFuture will be ready.<br />

2019-2020 Legislative Wrap-Up & 2021 Preview:  Where Does the PA General Assembly Stand on Our Environment?,12/16/2020,"<p>With the close of the legislative session in Harrisburg at the end of November&nbsp;came significant victories for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental protection, as a handful of bills were halted thanks to our work in the Capitol, and thanks to the many citizens who took action by contacting their elected officials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This would not have been possible without the advocacy and hard work from PennFuture staff, members, supporters, and partners across the environmental and conservation community in Pennsylvania. Through action alert emails that engaged citizens with their elected officials, in-district constituent meetings with members of the General Assembly, calls to offices, sign-on letters with partner organizations and coalitions, and multiple lobby days, our presence and direct opposition to these bills truly had an impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While advancing proactive, offensive, good environmental legislation remains a challenge in Harrisburg, PennFuture and partners killed, blocked, and bottled-up a host of anti-environmental and pro-fossil fuel bills and policies in the recent previous legislative session. Below, please find a summary of the good, bad and ugly bills we engaged with over this last legislative session.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Defensive Victories</strong></u>:</p>

<p>In terms of &quot;regulatory reform,&rdquo; which is really just another term for&nbsp;&ldquo;rollbacks,&rdquo; PennFuture and partners killed a number of dangerous bills in the General Assembly, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HB 430 (Legislative blocking/killing regulations&nbsp;via concurrent resolution)</li>
	<li>HB 414/HB 509/SB 252 (allowing for &lsquo;third-party permit review&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 762/SB 253 (&lsquo;Regulatory Compliance Advisor&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 507/ HB 806/SB 5 (Legislative approval of &lsquo;economically significant&nbsp;regulations&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 827/SB 305 (undermining the Delaware River Basin Commission with&nbsp;eminent domain and requiring &lsquo;just compensation&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 828 (Regulatory&nbsp;rollback for unconventional drilling: siting, boreholes, water)</li>
	<li>HB 1055/SB 251 (Office of the Repealer)</li>
	<li>HB 1105 (Energize Pennsylvania package: &lsquo;consolidated standards permit&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 414/1106 (Energize Pennsylvania package: &lsquo;deemed approval&rsquo; of permits)</li>
	<li>HB 1107 (Energize Pennsylvania package: &lsquo;PA Permitting Commission&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 1874/SB 703 (Amending the Regulatory Review Act for more legislative control of the&nbsp;Independent Regulatory Review Commission)</li>
	<li>HB 2025/SB 950 (Requiring legislative approval of RGGI) - <em>Governor Wolf vetoed&nbsp;</em></li>
	<li>HB 2416/SB 327 (Regulatory tolling during COVID-19 emergency declaration)</li>
	<li>SB 323/887 (pipeline protest bill; &lsquo;critical infrastructure protection act&rsquo;; liability fees paid by protestors)</li>
	<li>SB 619 (attempt to eviscerate PA&rsquo;s Clean Streams Law)</li>
	<li>SB 726/727 (Cutting scope, powers, membership of Environmental Hearing Board)</li>
	<li>SB 790/HB 1635 (rolling back conventional drilling standards to 1984 levels) - <em>Governor Wolf vetoed</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of fossil fuel subsidies and giveaways, PennFuture and partners killed a number of dangerous bills in the General Assembly, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HB 11/SB 510 (unlimited &amp; open-ended nuclear subsidies with no Tier 1 AEPS increase)</li>
	<li>HB 695 (incentives for waste-to-energy &lsquo;recycling&rsquo;)</li>
	<li>HB 1100 (Energize Pennsylvania package: open-ended subsidy for 30 years at $660B per petrochemical&nbsp;plant) - <em>Governor Wolf vetoed</em></li>
	<li>HB 1102 (Energize Pennsylvania package: KEEZ/Keystone Energy Enhancement Zones for petrochemicals).</li>
	<li>HB 1392/SB 845 (punitive fees on electric vehicle owners)</li>
	<li>SB 716/717 (Natural Gas development on state lands)</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of raiding environmental protection &amp; conservation in the state&rsquo;s budgets and special funds, PennFuture and partners killed a number of dangerous bills in the General Assembly, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HB 1822 (Putting a freeze on spending out of several environmental special funds)</li>
	<li>HB 1988 (Placing environmental special funds into the state&rsquo;s General Fund)</li>
	<li>HB 2004 (Gives the General Assembly control to allocate funds from special funds)</li>
	<li>SB 1034 (Amending fiscal code to include &ldquo;grant management&nbsp;oversight&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Offensive Victories:</strong></u></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Harrisburg has offered up few bright spots in terms of legislative&nbsp;offensive victories that are pro-environment during this last two-year legislative session, but state lawmakers did a few, great things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Creation of new, innovative &ldquo;Pennsylvania Farm Bill&rdquo; that elevates agricultural conservation work</li>
	<li>Allocated $3M for REAP (Resource Enhancement and Protection Tax Credit)</li>
	<li>Allocated $2M for the Conservation Excellence program at the PA Department of Agriculture</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Challenges:</strong></u></p>

<p>A few terrible pieces of legislation passed through the General Assembly and secured the Governor&rsquo;s signature this year, mostly via nefarious policy riders to the fiscal codes of budget packages&nbsp;that PennFuture and partners will continue to fight back against, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HB 732 (petrochemical subsidy to the tune of $670M over 26 years to 4 petrochemical plants)</li>
	<li>HB 2536 (waste coal subsidy by &lsquo;closing the borders&rsquo; for Tier II of AEPS)</li>
	<li>2019&rsquo;s fiscal code (waste coal subsidy for $200M)</li>
	<li>HB 1103 (building out state&rsquo;s PIPE program, increased gas infrastructure)</li>
	<li>Repeal of data reporting requirements outlined by Act 54 for mining operations in the recent 2021 state budget package&rsquo;s fiscal code (former SB 763)</li>
	<li>Termination of Joint Legislative Conservation Commission (JLCC) at the end of 2021 in 2019-2020FY budget</li>
	<li>HB 1808 (promotion of plastics/petrochemicals as &lsquo;recycling&rsquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>What Legislation We Expect to See Next Session (2021-22):</strong></u></p>

<p>Several beneficial bills advancing clean energy, environmental protection and conservation have failed to pass this session, but we will continue to advocate for them next year alongside partners. Here&rsquo;s what to look for in the coming months in terms of the work ahead:</p>

<p><em>Advancing Clean &amp; Renewable Energy</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Moving forward the DEP&rsquo;s &ldquo;Carbon Trading Program&rdquo; through the regulatory process</li>
	<li>Establishing&nbsp;carbon Cap &amp; Invest programs in Pennsylvania (formerly SB 15/ HB 2586)</li>
	<li>Passing Community Solar legislation (formerly HB 531/SB 705)</li>
	<li>Expanding &amp; modernizing the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS, formerly SB 600/ HB 1195)</li>
	<li>Enacting legislation increasing buildout of infrastructure for electric vehicles (formerly SB 596)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Advancing Environmental Protections &amp; Holding Polluters Accountable</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Closing loopholes on hydraulic fracturing waste (cosponsor memoranda out now from Sen. Muth &amp; Rep. Innamorato)</li>
	<li>Passing legislation implementing recommendations from Attorney General Shapiro&rsquo;s 2020 report on environmental crimes by polluters in hydraulic fracturing</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Advancing Clean Water Legislation</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Setting increased training &amp; application requirements for fertilizer (formerly SB 915)</li>
	<li>Passing the &ldquo;Agriculture Conservation Assistance Program&rdquo; (ACAP - formerly SB 1272), which would give much-needed support to farmers to implement best management practices and conservation work to improve water quality</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Advancing Equity and Funding for Green Stimulus &amp; Recovery</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Advocating that Gov. Wolf is bold in his budget address in early February and advocating for an equitable budget as it moves through the General Assembly this Spring, a continuation of PennFuture&rsquo;s &ldquo;Green Stimulus &amp; Recovery&rdquo; work</li>
	<li>Working with frontline community advocates to pass legislation establishing an &ldquo;Office of Just Transition&rdquo; and legislation giving more teeth to the PA DEP&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Justice coupled with increased interagency coordination and review of justice concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture and partners in the environmental and conservation community will again be busy in defensive work. 2021 is setting up to be a year of more hope and opportunity, but many of the same legislative themes will persist. Pennsylvania legislators will likely take yet another crack at &ldquo;Regulatory Reform&rdquo; legislation such as the &ldquo;Office of the Repealer&rdquo; bill, more legislation attempting to eviscerate the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Clean Streams Law, and more fossil fuel subsidies like the&nbsp;recent waste coal giveaways and the behemoth gifts to the petrochemical industry outlined in the Energize Pennsylvania&nbsp;plan.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, we&rsquo;re likely to continue playing defense against austere and draconian budget cuts to our agencies and dedicated funds for environmental protection and conservation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For now, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and State Senate will return to Harrisburg on January 5th to swear-in new Members of the General Assembly, but the two legislative bodies will likely not be back in full swing (and voting session) until mid-late January. Very soon thereafter, Governor Wolf will introduce his proposed state budget for the 2021-22 fiscal year and agency budget hearings for the Appropriations Committees will begin their work in earnest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will continue to advocate for a clean and responsible state budget, track and advance legislation that protects our environment, act&nbsp;on climate, and we will defend against any attacks on our Commonwealth&rsquo;s crucial clean air, water, and natural resource protections.</p>

More Challenges Knocking on Dimock’s Door,12/8/2020,"<p>Dimock has long played the unwelcomed role of ground zero in the fracking crisis in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Early on during the fracking boom, this quiet, rural township in Susquehanna County became notorious for explosive water wells, toxic tap water, and aquatic dead zones in its wetlands.<br />
Today more challenges are knocking on Dimock&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>News reports suggest Dimock may serve as the location for Eastern Pennsylvania&rsquo;s first deep injection fracking well. Although a formal injection well application has yet to be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, residents located within 1,000 feet of the planned well received letters notifying them of project plans.</p>

<p>An EPA spokesperson <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/11/25/dimock-residents-worry-about-planned-fracking-waste-well/"">told StateImpact PA</a> that representatives of Kendra II, a fracking logistics firm based just south of Dimock, met with agency officials this fall to discuss plans for the injection well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Residents are rightfully concerned about the threat to their properties, health, and safety.</p>

<p>Although not directly connected to the potential Kendra II injection well, a history of irresponsible drilling practices has literally poisoned the drinking water wells in Dimock. Attorney General Josh Shapiro recently announced charges against major fracking operator Cabot Oil &amp; Gas for alleged criminal violations of the Clean Streams Law.</p>

<p>Almost 15 years have passed since Cabot started to develop dozens of private gas wells within a nine-square-mile area around Dimock. Since then, poisonous chemicals have been discovered in 27 private wells, and explosive levels of methane have been detected in 17.</p>

<p>A Department of Environmental Protection investigation resulted in a restriction on Cabot gas operations around the town, known as the Dimock box, as well as a plan to restore water supplies. Unfortunately, it took Cabot nearly a decade to begin gas well remediation. Many violations remain unresolved today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Kendra II injection well would introduce a new set of challenges.</p>

<p>About a dozen deep injection wells are currently permitted in Pennsylvania, but Ohio currently bares most of the brunt. Rising transportation and disposal costs are, however, leading the industry to push for more wells to be located in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deep injection wells can extend more than a mile underground. The injection process sends a combination of salty brine, hazardous chemicals, radioactive waste, and heavy metals into belowground formations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This process has proved to be just about as reckless as it sounds. Hazardous wastewater disposed of in injection wells has been known to migrate and contaminate the drinking water of nearby residents. And the impacts do not stop there. Earthquakes associated with injection wells are popping up in Ohio, Oklahoma, and the Dakotas, at times shaking residents hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p>Dimock already knows well the risks posed by the fracking industry. Even the most well-intentioned fracking companies operate with risks that, any day, chemical waste could unintentionally spill or leak. These risks to local drinking water, combined with the possibility that fracking operations could result in earthquakes throughout the Susquehanna Valley, offer plenty of reasons to oppose the Kendra II wastewater injection well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dimock has already suffered enough.</p>

<p>PennFuture will be watching this situation closely as it unfolds, and we will be sure to keep the public informed in the months ahead.</p>

PennFuture Releases Blueprint to Protect Pennsylvania's Lake Erie Watershed,12/3/2020,"<p>Today, PennFuture&rsquo;s Erie office&nbsp;publicly released <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/ErieCommonAgenda_6.pdf"">Our Water, Our Future: A Common Agenda for Protecting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Lake Erie Watershed.</a></p>

<p>This comprehensive document describes the major threats to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Lake Erie watershed and recommends several solutions to those threats. The Erie region relies heavily on its water resources to attract people to live, work, and play in Erie County. However, the use of those resources and development decisions that are made can lead to their eventual degradation. This Agenda recommends many ways that Erie&rsquo;s decision makers can develop in an equitable, sustainable way, while continuing to benefit from its abundant water resources.</p>

<p>This Agenda was developed by convening local and regional environmental, wildlife, and civic organizations. Twelve partner organizations signed on to the Agenda but at least ten more were engaged in the process of developing it. We met several times via Zoom throughout Summer 2020 to identify threats, prioritize them based on their impacts to human health, the natural environment, and the economy, and brainstorm solutions. A technical advisory committee of non-governmental organizations and several regional scientists was engaged to ensure that the document was technically sound and well-informed. We also sought to ensure that the document made a strong call for racial equity and inclusion, made even more important by Erie County&rsquo;s declaration that <a href=""http://public.eriecountypa.gov/councildocs/resolutions/2020-43.pdf"">racism is a public health crisis.</a></p>

<p>Three organizations acted as social justice consultants by reviewing the Agenda and making recommendations for strengthening the message of equity and inclusion in decision making. The result of these collaborative efforts is a forward-thinking agenda calling for local, county, state, and federal policies that protect our vitally important water resources and promote sustainable development that will improve quality of life for all current and future Erie County residents.</p>

<p>The water quality threats that Common Agenda partners identified are surface runoff including stormwater, agricultural runoff, and sewage, climate change, fossil fuels and plastic pollution, invasive species, and legacy pollution. While the solutions to these threats vary, they all require that municipalities and Erie County embrace the responsibility of being communities on the Great Lakes. This will not only lead to better protected water and healthy communities, it can also stoke the flames of a blue economy in the region.</p>

<p>Among the recommendations are calls to improve collaboration and communication throughout decision-making processes. The social unrest that Erie and the nation have experienced calls everyone to develop new ways of doing things that will not perpetuate persistent inequities and injustice. This agenda invites regional residents, businesses, and government leaders to use the issue of water protection to develop county and municipal level committees that increase resident engagement in decision making. For example, it recommends that Erie County Council establish an Environmental Justice Committee that monitors and responds to disproportionate impacts of pollution on historically burdened residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Erie region is rich in water resources and its current revitalization efforts have relied heavily upon that premise. However, this revitalization will be short lived if it fails to protect these assets and water quality declines. The region needs sustainable transformational change that can only be achieved through inclusive collaboration, equitable decision making, and policies and practices that protect natural resources. This agenda provides a blueprint for all three of these necessities.</p>

<p>PennFuture and its partners will move this agenda forward by meeting with regional stakeholders and government officials to discuss water protection policies and practices and advocate for more inclusive decision-making processes. These collaborative efforts will bring new and important voices to the table and add value to the region&rsquo;s revitalization efforts.&nbsp;</p>

Building the United States' Green Economy Future through Appalachia,12/2/2020,"<p>When I returned to environmental work in Pennsylvania in 2015, after five years working in Maryland for the Audubon Society, I was struck by how much the fracked gas industry&rsquo;s influence was able to dominate policy and policymakers here in the Commonwealth. The firm grip the coal industry had on the legislature for nearly a hundred years had been supplanted by frackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lobbying became a growth industry. New government relations and PR firms occupy Harrisburg offices and real estate, all to help out with the influence peddling and promotion of friendly legislation the industry would need to optimize gas in the Marcellus and Utica shales, and turn it into profits. Regulation was at best weak&mdash;Act 13 left a lot of loopholes and wiggle room for industry to pollute. And the state budget allocations that our regulatory agencies need as their lifeblood to provide oversight of this polluting and secretive industry were squeezed to a drip&mdash;a circumstance our legislature continues today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>With few exceptions, this industry and its political machine has maintained a stranglehold on many elected officials. The industry&rsquo;s playbook disburses campaign contributions throughout the state regardless if a legislative district contains gas, because in Harrisburg, sometimes, every vote counts.&nbsp;Just as dangerous, the frackers&rsquo; public relations firms spin out jobs numbers and promises that any legislator or work-hungry labor union ignored at their peril. The industry created a near unsurmountable ring of self-interest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a fact of life for us that PennFuture&rsquo;s energies are spent defending the environmental protections we fought hard to win in the past. We fight legislative attacks on industry regulations session after session, year after year, and sometimes multiple, identical attacks in any given time period. It became evident to me back then&nbsp;that we&rsquo;d be fighting in the legislature for a few more years at best. The majority of our state legislators embrace the status quo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The people&rsquo;s house in Harrisburg cannot be relied upon for leadership to transition away from fracked gas, a transition that must happen if we are to reckon with our climate, race, economic and public health crises&nbsp;that are all crashing into each other at the moment.</p>

<p>When I became president of PennFuture, I felt strongly that one of the most important proactive things that needed to happen if this state is to ever break away from the grips of fossil fuels, fracking, petrochemical and plastics was the creation of an alternative economic development and job creation strategy for our state. It was incorporated into our strategic plan, but the question remained about the suitability of an environmental policy and advocacy shop like PennFuture to tackle this. We kept talking it up, particularly to our funders, and to potential partners who also occupied the policy space but with more substantial chops in economics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The looming build-out of the so-called Appalachian Storage Hub in the Upper Ohio River Valley&nbsp;became a catalyst for concerned groups from Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky to talk about defending our region from it. Eventually that talk turned to offense and the urgent need to develop an alternative economic and jobs strategy. That economic and jobs blueprint is now encompassed by the campaign called <a href=""https://reimagineappalachia.org/"">Reimagine Appalachia</a>, in which PennFuture participates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reimagine Appalachia has produced the vision and economic substantiation to turn the region into a nexus for investments that create a regional economy that is sustainable and adapted to the realities of climate change.&nbsp;Characterized by modernizing infrastructure, greening manufacturing, restoring and managing lands decimated by legacy pollution into wide swaths of carbon storing acreage, and by jobs programs that can employ a diversity of people currently finding working difficult due to a variety of factors, this platform will produce 250,000 jobs in Pennsylvania alone.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>This past spring, PennFuture staff, who were veterans of the 2008 recession and well-acquainted with the stimulus investments that were made to get a faltering country back on its feet, issued our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Green-Stimulus-FINAL.pdf"">Green Stimulus and Economic Recovery Platform for Pennsylvania</a>. We were able to leverage our knowledge about the inherent strengths of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy that were not linked to fossil fuels and put forth investment ideas for those sectors. Bolstering the strength of what we refer to as nature-based economic sectors, such as outdoor recreation and agriculture, and the network of small businesses that support these sectors, PennFuture argues for targeted investments to bridge the impacts of the pandemic and diversify the state economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like Reimagine Appalachia&rsquo;s platform, we see real opportunities in a green jobs program. We see jobs to restore land and water impacted by not only past pollution, but jobs installing projects that the state is relying on to meet water pollution reduction requirements, and that are in need of funding that stimulus funds can provide. Our Green Stimulus proposals call for investments in bold clean energy projects as well as energy efficiency retrofits for residences and businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In total, through $2.83 billion in annual investments for the duration of the pandemic and the recession it&rsquo;s caused, we estimate the state will preserve or create over 389,000 jobs. Additional economic benefits would come from embracing recommendations on growing and transitioning to a clean energy economy, similar to the aspirations of Reimagine Appalachia.</p>

<p>Another exciting breakthrough came just last week when mayors of eight leading cities in the Ohio River Valley&mdash;the identical geography of Reimagine Appalachia&mdash;including Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, issued a <a href=""https://www.sustainablebusiness.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/mp4ma_roadmap_-_final_1.pdf"">Marshall Plan for Middle America.</a> The plan deftly proposes to position the region for national and international competitiveness, and at the same time addresses regional economic and other disparities, by transitioning into a center for renewable energy infrastructure, and manufacturing and infrastructure innovations, among other proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so this politically influential region has emerged from the weight of 2020 and has articulated through these three documents a similarity of vision, intention, and determination of where this region wants to go, and must go. And while these are intended as roadmaps for a region, and one that too often has been left behind, therein are opportunities and ideas for the nation. But our climate justice and clean energy future must begin here in Appalachia, whose people, land and water have paid a dear price for powering the nation and world for almost two hundred years.</p>

<p>Finally, the alternative vision that can make a difference.</p>

"PA General Assembly Wraps Up Annual Budget, Punts on Stimulus",11/25/2020,"<p>Last week, the Pennsylvania General Assembly hammered out the final pieces of this year&rsquo;s state budget, which began in late May when the Legislature passed a five-month stopgap budget package. On a bipartisan basis, the Legislature passed the budget bill (SB 1350) and the fiscal code bill (HB 2536) and the Governor signed the legislation into law Monday. For a number of reasons, the package was very problematic and PennFuture urged opposition to both bills during their consideration by the General Assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only did the Legislature not act on completing the budget without cutting environmental and conservation funds, it sorely missed the mark on making key investments in recovery and protecting Pennsylvanians during the ongoing pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Senate Bill 1350 (Browne) - 2020-21FY Supplemental State Budget:</strong></u><br />
House vote: 104Y-97N<br />
Senate vote: 31Y-18N</p>

<p>While most of the environmental protection and conservation budget lines were approved with flat-funded appropriations from the 2019-20FY levels, a number of accounts do take significant hits. We understand that this year&rsquo;s budget is difficult given the roughly $5B structural deficit coupled with the hole caused by the pandemic-induced recession, but flat-funding our agencies is still felt as a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; due to being less than the &ldquo;cost to carry.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
	<li>For instance, this year&rsquo;s budget approves a 100% ($1,000) cut to the &ldquo;Great Lakes Restoration&rdquo; effort as a part of the PA Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources budget.</li>
	<li>Additionally, 38.5% of the account for &ldquo;Forest Management &amp; Processing&rdquo; ($2.5M) and most concerningly, almost 2% of the line for &ldquo;State Parks Operations&rdquo; ($985,000) was cut.</li>
</ul>

<p>Though the need is overwhelming and advocates have been pushing for increased funding for many years, the water and river basin commissions again take big cuts. With this final budget package (FY2020-21) they are funded at:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$127,000 for the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC)</li>
	<li>$119,000 for the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC)</li>
	<li>$13,000 for the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB)</li>
	<li>$40,000 for the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO) &amp;</li>
	<li>$175,000 for the Chesapeake Bay Commission.</li>
</ul>

<p>Long a legislative interest and sought after place to raid funding to plug other budget holes, the special, dedicated environmental and conservation funds were once again targeted. Though the Recycling Fund was gutted to the tune of $50M (nearly 50% of its total appropriation) and the Agricultural Conservation Easement Purchase Fund was hit, <strong>PennFuture, along with partners in the environmental and conservation community, saved the Environmental Stewardship Fund (Growing Greener) and Keystone Recreations, Parks, and Conservation Fund.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><u><strong>A Closer Look at the Agencies&rsquo; Funding Levels via SB 1350:</strong></u></p>

<p><strong>Department of Environmental Protection</strong><br />
General Government Operations: $8,729,000<br />
Environmental Program Mgmt.: $18, 452,000<br />
Chesapeake Bay Agricultural Source Abatement: $1,696,000<br />
Environmental Protection Operations: $54,215,000</p>

<p><strong>Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources</strong><br />

Park &amp; Forest Infrastructure Projects: $525,000</p>

<p><strong>What about code bills?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the appropriations bill and special fund shenanigans, the General Assembly often passes associated &ldquo;code bills&rdquo; that implement the budget across different areas. These code bills are often used to move nefarious pieces of legislation that, by themselves, wouldn&rsquo;t make it through the legislature. This fall, the legislature has only passed a fiscal code bill to accompany the budget bill. HB 2536 does hold a few problems and bad policy riders. Because of these, PennFuture urged opposition to the fiscal code.</p>

<p><u><strong>House Bill 2536 (James) - Fiscal Code:</strong></u><br />
House vote: 108Y-92N<br />
Senate vote: 33Y-16N</p>

<p><strong>Closing the Borders of Tier II in Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS)</strong></p>

<p>HB 2536 included language similar to the proposed SB1305 (Argall) that would close the &lsquo;borders&rsquo; for Tier II of the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS). This language is identical to legislation from 2017 that would close the &lsquo;borders&rsquo; for solar energy in the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards to help level the playing field for renewable energy and incentivize growth of the renewable energy industry in Pennsylvania, increasing the solar providers in the state. This provision slipped into the fiscal code bill is a giveaway to polluting waste-coal, which could lead to more burning of the coal refuse, dirtying Pennsylvania&rsquo;s air. It is yet another fossil fuel subsidy that the legislature has a storied history of doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Repeal of Act 54 Report</strong></p>

<p>HB 2536 also includes language that hamstrings the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s ability to spend monies and collect fees and penalties as put forth by reporting requirements in Act 54 of 1966, known as the Bituminous Mine Subsidence and Land Conservation Act. This will allow more companies in the mining industry to go without meeting accountability measures set by environmental legislation in the Commonwealth in the 1960s. We must keep these measures in place so that we do not add harm to the historical degradation and legacy pollution from the coal industry in Pennsylvania. No more orange water, acid mine drainage, dewatered streams, and abandoned mine lands. The industry must pay to clean up their own messes and the PA DEP must be well situated to act as the chief regulator and protector of our natural resources.</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps</strong><br />
For many of the issues impacting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment, the costs will only continue to increase the longer they go unabated. State budgets are the ultimate reflection of policy making priorities. Our state priorities are far out of order and need to be changed before the problems become intractable and the harm to our citizens grows more severe.</p>

<p>This fall, the state legislature and elected representatives in Washington balked at passing much-needed, further COVID relief to state and local governments. Where stimulus and recovery monies and large-scale efforts would have proved helpful, we now wait to see what the next administration, 117th Congress and new Pennsylvania General Assembly can accomplish in terms of stimulus and recovery.</p>

<p>PennFuture stands ready to urge lawmakers to make significant investments in green stimulus and recovery including making whole our environmental protection and conservation agencies, new money for supporting nature-based jobs, sustainable agriculture and small food producers, revamping our water infrastructure, significant build-outs in energy efficiency and renewable energy, and more. We will also endeavor to make sure Pennsylvania&rsquo;s stimulus and recovery initiatives are equitable and well serve all Pennsylvanians no matter their station.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve reached the end of this 2019-2020 legislative session in Harrisburg, but we are excited for the next chapter to begin soon. We&rsquo;ll continue to push forward good environmental and clean energy legislation and fight back against anti-environmental bills that are sure to come our way. We&rsquo;ll also keep fighting for a restored budget for our critical agencies. Be on the lookout for a legislative session wrap-up blog coming soon to break down what bills didn&rsquo;t make it across the finish line, which bad bills we&rsquo;ve vanquished, and what bills (good and bad) we&rsquo;re likely to see again in the new session.</p>

Confronting Reality: Pennsylvania Leaders Refuse to Acknowledge State of Petrochemical Industry,11/23/2020,"<p>In the United States&mdash;<o:p></o:p>the biggest fossil fuel producer in the world&mdash;Pennsylvania is second in shale gas production only to Texas. But even Texas is willing to admit something that many Pennsylvania leaders continue to deny: The shale gas and petrochemical industry is dying.</p>

<p>The latest evidence of this came earlier this week when <a href=""https://www.timesleaderonline.com/news/local-news/2020/11/ptt-delays-cracker-investment-decision-again/?fbclid=IwAR0KFIRLK-Oumi8CmONlI7Get-QEUgeCPox-RWpCcJmMZJo7DYiJAOfe4YA"">PTT Global Chemical announced it was indefinitely delaying</a> a final investment decision on a new petrochemical project in southeast Ohio, dealing yet another blow to the <a href=""https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/lies-damned-lies-and-economic-impact-studies/"">so-called Appalachian petrochemical renaissance</a> envisioned by industry leaders and politicians alike. Even the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County will face significant hurdles once it begins operation, directly undercutting the economic impact it was originally predicted to have on the local economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All this bodes poorly for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fracked gas industry. Record production has led to an overwhelming oversupply of fracked gas and depressed prices <a href=""https://www.mcall.com/news/pennsylvania/mc-nws-pa-fracking-gas-production-20200916-f36hsugi35a3rgdbijuhdii6ve-story.html"">below the break-even point for much of the past two years.</a> Petrochemical plants, which convert fracked gas to plastics, were meant to gobble up this excess gas and restore prices and profits.</p>

<p>But as plans to deliver on the promised petrochemical buildout come into question, so too has the future of fracked gas in Pennsylvania. Policymakers have tried to patch these unfavorable economics with subsidies and fracked gas-favoring policies, but the billions of taxpayer dollars they&rsquo;ve thrown at the industry has done little to close the gap.</p>

<p>These local examples are mirrored across the world. In a May 2020 article, McKinsey&rsquo;s Houston-based team delivered a sobering analysis to oil and gas proponents, describing the current bust as &ldquo;an unprecedented crisis for the [oil and gas] industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The immediate effects are already staggering[...],&rdquo; the authors write. &ldquo;Looking out beyond today&rsquo;s crisis toward the late 2030s, the macro-environment is set to become even more challenging.&rdquo;<br />
In fact, as Pennsylvania continues to ignore the signs of industry collapse, others in Houston are joining McKinsey in a more honest dissection of the harsh economic realities of the failing oil and gas industry. So, in the words of reporters at the Houston Chronicle, in the heartland of oil and gas, I share with you the following:</p>

<p>From a November 18 article by Paul Takahashi titled <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Oil-bankruptcies-rise-in-the-third-quarter-15736171.php?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Chron_FuelFix&amp;utm_term=business&amp;utm_content=briefing&amp;stn=nf&amp;sid=5f11e83b7afa2729ae52e362"">&ldquo;Oil bankruptcies rise in the third quarter:&rdquo;</a></p>

<ul>
	<li>A new wave of bankruptcies is sweeping the oil and gas industry after the coronavirus pandemic crushed global demand for crude and petroleum products such as gasoline and jet fuel. Unlike past downturns, oil and gas companies are under increased financial pressure after many investors pulled out of the sector in 2018 after years of underperformance.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Shale&rsquo;s debt-fueled expansion came to a juddering halt due to lower gasoline demand and oil prices, but also because of Wall Street&rsquo;s increasing reluctance to fund growth at any cost.</li>

<ul>

<ul>
	<li>Oil companies also are reorganizing their businesses and laying off thousands of employees to prepare for a future with fewer fossil fuels. BP plans to lay off 10,000 workers and Chevron plans to lay off 6,000 workers by the end of the year. Exxon, the Irving-based oil giant, said it does not have layoff plans, but has changed its performance review process to be more stringent.</li>

<p>From a September 15 article by James Osborne titled <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/As-pipeline-projects-cancel-future-falls-into-15567085.php"">&ldquo;As pipeline projects cancel, future falls into question:&rdquo;</a></p>

<ul>
	<li>For years, a small clique of investors has questioned the logic of putting money into oil and gas pipelines that take decades to pay off when climate change policy was pushing the energy sector away from fossil fuels. Banks and other institutions, however, largely continued to finance the multibillion-dollar projects, confident in projections by oil and gas companies that the so-called energy transition would take time and oil and natural gas would be needed for decades to come. But a rash of cancellations and delays of new pipelines, largely brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, raises questions of whether those skeptics&rsquo; warnings are starting to catch on and the cancellations reflect a newfound wariness among banks to back the projects in view of an uncertain future for fossil fuels.</li>
</ul>

<p>From a July 30 article by Paul Takahashi titled <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Oil-and-gas-employment-forecast-to-bottom-out-15446433.php"">&ldquo;Oil and gas production jobs in Texas could hit bottom this fall:&rdquo;</a></p>

<ul>
	<li>The oil and gas industry was contracting well before the coronavirus pandemic broke out in the U.S. and brought the economy to a screeching halt. Employment in oil and gas production, including oil-field services jobs, was recovering from the previous downturn of 2014-16, climbing back to 228,500 jobs in December 2018, the alliance said. But then, Wall Street investment soured on the sector after years of underperformance, and the number of operating rigs and employment fell throughout 2019.</li>
</ul>

<p>As these excerpts show, Texas is confronting a reality that Pennsylvania leaders&mdash;from journalists, to state and local representatives, to the industry itself&mdash;continue to deny. COVID-19 has accelerated a shift that was long underway: the phasing out of the oil and gas industry, as well as associated infrastructure including pipelines, refineries, and petrochemical complexes.</p>

<p>This is not short-term conjecture but a long-term reality based on industry underperformance, insurmountable debt, commodity oversupply, and a souring attitude to fossil fuels from investors and global regulators. Anyone who fails to disclose this reality is not telling you the full truth.</p>

<p>Despite all this, the favoritism we continue to show for shale gas in Pennsylvania is astounding: Billions of dollars in tax credits, exemptions from critical public health and environmental protections, and a deafening silence on the industry&rsquo;s economic failures, let alone it&rsquo;s failures to public health, the environment, and our climate.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, independent climate journalist Emily Atkin <a href=""https://heated.world/p/climate-news-trump-can-use-corrected"">reported on the failure of national election coverage</a> to include the cost of doing nothing on climate change. When it comes to climate change and to the failing economics of the fossil fuel industry, these silences are not politically neutral, but instead uphold a status quo that is already leading to catastrophic climate impacts.</p>

<p>To report, to regulate, to understand these issues, we must first be able to admit the truth. Only then will we be able to recognize how we are propping up a dangerous and failing industry.&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture Intervenes to Support FERC Jurisdiction over Wyalusing LNG Facility,11/3/2020,"<p>PennFuture recently joined with the Sierra Club in moving to intervene in and protesting the petition to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&ldquo;FERC&rdquo;) by the owner/operator of the Wyalusing LNG facility, seeking an order by FERC that the agency does not have jurisdiction to review and regulate the facility&#39;s&nbsp;construction and operation under the federal Natural Gas Act (&ldquo;NGA&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Over the past year, PennFuture has been engaged with local community members and organizations in tracking and opposing this liquified natural gas (&ldquo;LNG&rdquo;) facility on the Susquehanna River and the transport of LNG by rail or truck across our communities to the export facility in Gibbstown, NJ on the banks of the Delaware River.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be sure, the Wyalusing facility&rsquo;s operations are speculative and untested, and the ramifications of the operations of the project (including the proposed transport in &ldquo;bomb trains&rdquo;) could be devastating to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and the health and safety of our communities, including environmental justice communities. The safety of this proposed LNG project is unknown; the environmental impacts of this LNG project are unknown; whether this LNG project is required by public convenience and necessity is unknown.</p>

<p>To learn more about LNG, its dangers, and the Wyalusing facility, please check out our LNG Blog Series: <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">LNG Blog #1</a>, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-2-Bomb-Trains-Through-Pennsylvania"">LNG Blog #2</a>, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-3-Protect-Northern-PA"">LNG Blog #3</a>, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-4-Liquified-Natural-Gas-Should-Not-Become-the-New-Bomb-Trains-to-Threaten-Our-Communities"">LNG Blog #4</a>, and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-5-Public-opposition-grows-to-proposed-LNG-shipping-terminals"">LNG Blog #5</a>.</p>

<p>In our protest to FERC, PennFuture argued that FERC has jurisdiction under both Section 3 and Article 7 of the NGA. First, the Wyalusing LNG facility is a &ldquo;LNG terminal&rdquo; subject to FERC&rsquo;s jurisdiction under Section 3 of the NGA. Second, the facility is transporting gas in interstate commerce as well as exporting gas in foreign commerce and so is subject to FERC&rsquo;s jurisdiction under Section 7 of the NGA. FERC decision precedent does not argue otherwise, and if FERC were not to exercise jurisdiction it would create an unintended regulatory loophole under the NGA. Moreover, the proposed project is contrary to the public interest. Allowing the Wyalusing LNG facility to evade comprehensive FERC review risks the health of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s communities and environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intervening in this petition is just the first step in ensuring full federal review, oversight, and enforcement of the Wyalusing LNG facility and connected transport and export processes.&nbsp;</p>

An Election Day Wish,11/2/2020,"<p>For the past two years now, a good many of the blogs I’ve created land on the importance of voting – do we really need another one? There are a great many crucial and upcoming matters on the near-horizon for PennFuture that we can talk about here. Among them, Pennsylvania will begin hearings soon on joining and shaping the very important climate-pollution-reducing program called <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2019/09/25/Rob-Altenburg-Pennsylvania-should-join-the-Regional-Greenhouse-Gas-Initiative-but-for-the-right-reasons/stories/201909250048"">the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a> (RGGI). We also have <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/10/18/Deadline-looms-to-defuse-Pennsylvania-s-budget-time-bomb/stories/202010160144"">tough state budget conversations</a> coming right around the corner in mid-November. </p>

<p>But nothing has captured the focus of most Pennsylvanians like this election season. Election Day, November 3, 2020, is nearly here.</p>

<p>Since the lead-up to the primary, this election cycle has been characterized by adapting to new pandemic-induced realities and risks around how we cast our votes. Voters and would-be voters have received straightforward and basic information about new voting and registration formats, but from a bewildering array of sources. Many sources say the same thing but in differing ways. Multiple players and sources can be problematic and feed into another more ugly characteristic of this election, and that is the amount of  unreliable sources, intentional disinformation, subtle undermining, and outright lying to try to discredit voting, this imperfect but still best action we have to participate in our democracy.</p>

<p>We have all walked a very long path to this election. There is excitement, fatigue, anticipation, dread, and a sense of just wanting this election to be over as soon as possible. I must, for the time being, live in a frame of hope and trust that the American people will come through for democracy, for our environment and on the sides of justice, equity and prosperity for all. We must all embrace the likelihood that in order for every vote to be counted, it will take some time, and that means patience on all our parts.</p>

<p>While we wait, let’s reflect on the incredible volunteers, organizations and workers driving this election, on all sides. They are doing everything they can to facilitate access to voting participation. </p>

<p>PennFuture’s Democracy for All team has remained energetic, creative and focused, with their gaze toward communities of color. These communities, who in addition to the strength they are bringing to the Black Lives Matter movement, and in addition to the loss they endure – along with brown communities- as heavily impacted by this pandemic, must now navigate new voting “rules” that rightly create suspicion and distrust.</p>

<p>In the end, if the people come to believe that voting doesn’t matter, our democracy will dissolve, and with it, a key paradigm around which a statewide environmental advocacy organization like PennFuture has been built.  </p>

<p>The outcomes of this election hold high stakes for our environment, and for addressing and ending the injustice and inequity that plague so many of our fellow Pennsylvanians.</p>

<p>So given the possibility for disruption after the election, PennFuture will be weighing its options for engagement, should advocacy be needed. We may find our organization heading back to the courts, or engaging with various elected officials if they become involved in post-election interference, and supporting those that need our assistance. </p>

<p>We will keep you informed through <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/democracyedition"">The Bark</a>, <a href=""https://www.democracyforall-pennfuture.com/"">Democracy for All</a>, and the offerings of our partner <a href=""https://www.conservationpa.org/"">Conservation Voters of PA</a>. And we will be asking for your help in the advocacy we may need to pursue. Until then, stay positive, stay healthy and if you haven’t already, vote!</p>

Green and Complete Streets Programs are Good for Communities and the Environment,10/29/2020,"<p>Last week, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and Philadelphia Streets Department announced they will be funding and installing improvements along Cobbs Creek Parkway, and also initiating a process for a more comprehensive design. This welcomed announcement comes after months of pressure from community residents and <a href=""https://medium.com/@councilmemberjg/west-philadelphia-elected-officials-provide-update-on-cobbs-creek-parkway-pedestrian-safety-efforts-5d70151e7876"">elected leaders Jamie Gauthier, Anthony Hardy Williams, and Joanna McClinton.</a> As part of this new initiative, PennFuture is recommending investments in green and complete streets to address decades of neglect including the environmental injustices of the urban heat island effect, unequal access to green space, and stormwater pollution.</p>

<p>Cobbs Creek Parkway is located on the border of West and Southwest Philadelphia and is a main traffic corridor for the city. In August, the intersection of Cobbs Creek and Catherine Street was the site of the tragic and preventable death of 25-year-old Avante Reynolds, who left behind a 2-month old son. Her death has renewed calls for action to address the safety of the busy highway. Investing in a green and complete streets design of Cobbs Creek Parkway can increase safety, improve the environment, and address inequity in Philadelphia’s neighborhoods. </p>

<p>This hit and run along Cobbs Creek Parkway is not an isolated incident, as there have been 155 crashes there between 2012 and 2016. Residents have lobbied the city and state for decades to invest in safety improvements, but in the end only got small changes. One of the reasons, residents acknowledge, for the lack of investment <a href=""https://whyy.org/episodes/how-racism-fueled/"">is structural racism</a>. The 12-mile long Parkway sits between the Cobbs Creek Park - a park where communities play and recreate, and on the edge of one of Philadelphia’s largest Black neighborhoods that was subject to 20th century redlining. Last month <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-How-a-clean-water-program-is-addressing-equity-in-Philadelphia"">I blogged about how redlining in Philadelphia</a> caused environmental injustices, particularly for Black communities, and how PennFuture is working to address some of the harms. </p>

<p>One way we’re working to address some of those harms is through our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/keep-philly-green"">Keep Philly Green & Water Clean Campaign in Philadelphia</a>, which is aimed at supporting the Green City, Clean Waters program - Philadelphia’s Combined Sewer Overflow Long Term Control Plan Update. The program relies primarily on green stormwater infrastructure to reduce combined sewer overflows. The 25 year plan aims to construct 10,000 greened acres using green stormwater infrastructure tools like rain gardens, tree trenches, and curbed bumpouts. Green stormwater infrastructure refers to a nature-based solution to water quality issues that urban stormwater runoff causes and provides greater benefits than conventional stormwater solutions. The plan aims to reduce stormwater pollution from the combined sewer system by 85 percent.  </p>

<p>But rain gardens, tree trenches, and curbed bumpouts do more than just intercept and filter stormwater. They also increase access to green space for Philadelphians, particularly in neighborhoods that were redlined and experienced decades of divestment from city and state agencies. The same neighborhoods that, during hot summer days, experience up to a 22 degree temperature difference because of a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island effect. The social, economic, and environmental benefits of green stormwater infrastructure, when combined with other city resources, can increase investments back into historically neglected neighborhoods. </p>

<p>Streets make up about 40 percent of most cities’ impervious surfaces, and streets are more than just pathways for automobiles. In the case of Cobbs Creek Parkway, along with being a major traffic artery through the city, the road is used by cyclists, walkers and joggers, buses and trolley, and neighbors seeking to play and recreate in the park. The Cobbs Creek Community Environmental Education Center located along the parkway features meadows, forest areas, two creeks and a wetland. Cobbs Creek Park is a community resource of basketball courts, picnic tables, and walking trails. It is the home of Cobbs Creek Recreation Center, ballfields, a skating rink, and swimming pool. </p>

<p>But roads have also been used historically to divide communities and prevent particular segments of populations from accessing resources. In Cobbs Creek’s predominantly Black community, the parkway also divides the community from safely accessing this community amenity and green space. The busy street and limited intersections for safe crossing make the road dangerous for neighbors to cross.</p>

<p>In 2009 Mayor Nutter issued an executive order that ensured the City’s streets would be designed, built, and maintained as <a href=""https://www.philadelphiastreets.com/complete-streets/"">“Complete Streets”</a>. What this means is that the City’s streets would accommodate “all users of the transportation system, be they pedestrians, bicyclists, public transit users, or motor vehicle drivers.” The <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/media/20170914173121/Complete-Streets-Design-Handbook-2017.pdf"">Complete Streets Design Handbook</a> includes traffic and pedestrian accommodating elements as well as urban design tools like green stormwater infrastructure. Green infrastructure used in Complete Streets design can act as a traffic calming measure and community beautification tool that also makes the streets greener and safer for pedestrians and reduces stormwater pollution.</p>

<p>One example of this type of Complete Streets design is a green stormwater infrastructure project at <a href=""http://water.phila.gov/blog/berks-sedgley-ribbon-cutting"">Berks Street and Sedgley Avenue</a> in the neighborhood of Strawberry Mansion. The Water Department recently installed a scope of GSI elements, including a rain garden, subsurface trench, tree trenches and planters. But the construction was also able to include a number of safety improvements to reshape the infrastructure, <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/rain-garden-in-strawberry-mansion-holds-water-and-makes-students-safer/"">providing a safer, more beautiful route</a> for students who frequent the intersection on their way to school and the nearby park. New pedestrian crosswalks, additional parking, and upgrades to ADA ramps were all part of the system’s construction. The project also included <a href=""http://water.phila.gov/blog/everything-about-water-strawberry-mansion"">community participation and engagement</a> that allows residents to offer feedback. </p>

<p>The Philadelphia Water Department has already <a href=""http://water.phila.gov/blog/2019-in-review-part-3"">contributed meaningful significant investments</a> into Cobbs Creek Park. Parts of the Cobbs Creek itself are serviced by combined sewer overflow systems, meaning that when it rains or when snow melts, the runoff combines with household wastewater and the sewers discharge untreated wastewater into the creek. This is the problem that the water department is working to correct through the Green City, Clean Waters program. The green stormwater management tools capture the stormwater before it enters into the sewer systems, filtering the water and reducing the capacity entering the system, ultimately reducing the amount of untreated discharge into nearby waters. </p>

<p>This Spring the water department completed an installation of more than 25 stormwater management tools that collect runoff along Cobbs Creek Parkway from North of Market Street all the way down to Baltimore Avenue. The improvements keep about 372,000 gallons of stormwater out of local sewers during a 1-inch rainstorm. Features include close to 60 new trees, one basin, four bumpouts, 11 infiltration trenches, seven rain gardens and three tree trenches. These green improvements not only benefit the local waterways, but also benefit the community by providing traffic calming improvements, increasing green space, and beautifying the neighborhood.</p>

<p>However, other parts of the parkway are not within the combined sewer overflow area, but do experience significant flooding and stormwater related pollution. Unfortunately, those parts of the creek are outside the scope of the Green City, Clean Waters program. Without the focus of this program, Philadelphia must do more to ensure that all of the community receives similar benefits. The multiple community, pedestrian, vehicular, and environmental concerns require a comprehensive plan.</p>

<p>The announcement from PennDOT of its work to improve this area and consider a comprehensive design process is welcome progress to address the inequities. But the community’s voice must be included in the process to ensure that the improvements benefit not only traffic and stormwater issues, but community health and safety measures. Throughout the process PennFuture will work with residents, state and local agencies, and elected officials to elevate the importance of green and complete streets and bring environmental investments to long neglected communities.</p>

Setting the Record Straight About Fracking in Pennsylvania,10/26/2020,"<p>The issue of fracking in Pennsylvania has taken center stage this election season, with dozens of television news segments, newspaper articles and political commercials dedicated to the topic.&nbsp;With so much media saturation given to it, it should come as no surprise that some basic facts about fracking have been misrepresented, misconstrued or, in some cases, completely fabricated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For starters, while fracking has become politically toxic on the state and national level, <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/new-poll-shows-majority-of-pennsylvanians-oppose-fracking/Content?oid=17800496"">a majority of Pennsylvania voters actually oppose it</a>. This, as we will see, is no surprise given the mixed economic impact and severe consequences for social impacts, public health, environmental quality, and climate stability.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, fracking has been marketed to legislators and their constituents as an opportunity to turn around the fracked gas bust and create widespread economic opportunities. Part of the marketing ploy involves a consistent misrepresentation of the facts. The number of fracking jobs <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/10/09/trump-pounds-fracking-as-a-wedge-issue-in-pa-but-if-its-not-a-top-concern-for-voters-how-much-can-it-help/"">has been wildly inflated</a>, with industry jockeys citing numbers up to 35 times those provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get the records straight: The industry employs <a href=""https://www.vox.com/21529260/fracking-biden-trump-2020-presidential-debate-climate-change"">about 24,000 people</a> and contributes <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2020/10/21/An-American-success-story/stories/202009250047"">about $583 million</a> to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy annually. To put this number into perspective, there are 10 times as many Pennsylvania jobs <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Publication-A-Green-Stimulus-and-Recovery-Platform-for-Pennsylvania"">in outdoor tourism and recreation</a> with $29.1 billion in economic benefits, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Publication-A-Green-Stimulus-and-Recovery-Platform-for-Pennsylvania"">11 times as many in agriculture</a> with $135.7 billion in economic benefits,&nbsp;and <a href=""https://e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-pennsylvania-2020/"">3 times as many in energy efficiency</a>. To make matters worse, shale gas jobs&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/us/for-oil-workers-deadliest-danger-is-driving.html"">are often non-union jobs</a> with modest pay and no health benefits, despite the many occupational hazards that threaten the health and safety of these workers.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, many of the &ldquo;local&rdquo; jobs made available by the fracking industry go either unfilled or are outsourced, with the industry citing <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/articles/appalachian-energy-and-petrochemical-renaissance#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Energy,of%20its%20abundant%20energy%20resources."">&ldquo;a persistent misalignment of skills with needs&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;and local youth <a href=""https://www.rural.palegislature.us/documents/reports/Marcellus-Report-8-Economics.pdf"">expressing disinterest</a> in joining the migrant workforce. Perhaps to overcome this local shortage, but more importantly to cut costs at a time when prospects for the industry appear dim in light of climate change mitigation efforts, big oil companies are <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Shell-to-Cut-Up-to-9-000-Jobs-as-Virus-Forces-15608330.php"">restructuring for a leaner workforce</a>. Just last month, Shell announced that it will lay off 10 percent of its employees over the next two years.</p>

<p>With so few direct employment opportunities for Pennsylvania residents, most of the employment gains from shale gas development are attributed to &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; or &ldquo;salary-induced&rdquo; jobs. And herein we find the widely inflated job numbers, <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/letters/2020/10/13/Fact-checking-the-energy-secretary/stories/202010060118"">cited most recently by Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette</a>, that include everything from downstream plastics manufacturers to convenience and gas station workers, as well as other similarly <a href=""https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/sites/default/files/fracking_jobs_memo_final.pdf"">far-fetched &ldquo;salary-induced&rdquo; jobs</a>, many of which existed before the shale gas boom.</p>

<p>In essence, the industry creates a negligible percentage of Pennsylvania jobs, many of which are outsourced, while taking credit for a broad swath of jobs in other industries.&nbsp;What, then, is its actual impact on local communities?</p>

<p>The impact, it appears, is a mixed bag. The benefits are, on the whole, non-local, uneven, and short-term. Employment opportunities are limited, meaning that most of the increase in local taxable income has been driven by <a href=""https://www.rural.palegislature.us/documents/reports/Marcellus-Report-8-Economics.pdf"">increased rents and royalties</a> from those that lease their land to drillers. This means that most benefits accrue to the privileged few who own land, <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/2/025001"">plenty of whom are non-local themselves</a>. And wherever the income comes from, whether from employment or leased land, and wherever it goes, all of it is temporary. After drilling, <a href=""https://www.rural.palegislature.us/documents/reports/Marcellus-Report-8-Economics.pdf"">98 percent of shale gas development jobs dry up</a>, and rents and royalties dry up soon after.</p>

<p>But what about the so-called salary-induced jobs? Business activity has indeed increased in heavily fracked areas. However, the business activity occurs <a href=""https://www.rural.palegislature.us/documents/reports/Marcellus-Report-8-Economics.pdf"">primarily at big box stores</a> owned by non-locals. Meanwhile, locally owned businesses <a href=""https://www.rural.palegislature.us/documents/reports/Marcellus-Report-8-Economics.pdf"">have declined in heavily fracked counties</a>. In either case, the business activity &ndash; mostly driven by transient gas workers staying in hotels and eating out &ndash; can only last as long as the drilling does, at most a few years.</p>

<p>And these benefits do not come without harm. Empirical analyses have found that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s shale gas development has led to in the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2814147"">An influx of transient</a>, less educated, young, unmarried male workers with few social ties to the areas in which they temporarily settle</li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629619308513"">An increase in sex trafficking</a> and prostitution, sexually transmitted diseases, <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/ECONW-Costs_of_Fracking-May2019.pdf"">drug use, and drunk driving</a></li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.lycoming.edu/political-science/pdfs/marcellus-housing-report-2015.pdf"">More expensive rental housing</a>, degraded quality of housing units, and housing shortages, due to the influx of short-term, transient workers, and a related increase in homelessness</li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988316303590"">A decline in educational attainment</a> (PA was not a part of this study, but the association was found in all three study states &ndash; MO, WV, and ND)</li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.rff.org/publications/reports/the-accident-externality-from-trucking/"">An increase in truck traffic</a>, leading to noise pollution, stress, car accidents, and related fatalities</li>

</ul>

<p>Other studies have found that dependence on natural resources such as shale gas leads to <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08941920.2020.1728000?journalCode=usnr20"">deepening educational disparities</a>, <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/ECONW-Costs_of_Fracking-May2019.pdf"">less resilient and diverse economies</a>, <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014292106000614"">increased corruption</a>, and <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0928765510000485"">anemic economic growth</a>. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania residents living nearest to drilling <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FINAL-fracking-report-w.responses-with-page-number-V2.pdf"">have reported frequent nose bleeds</a>; chronic stress; the inability to sleep due to bright lights, noise, and vibrations through the night; intense stomach pains; and feelings of isolation and lack of control as property values drop and prevent homeowners from relocating. To make matters worse, those reaping the benefits of fracking (distant corporate offices, transient workers, and landowners) <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/2/025001"">are not the same as those most impacted</a> by its harms (low-income renters and fenceline residents).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, legislators have largely bought into the industry&rsquo;s economic development narrative, so much so that they were willing to subsidize its use with $2 billion in tax credits over the next 25 years. And while taxpayer dollars are pouring into the industry, <a href=""https://ieefa.org/ieefa-from-zero-to-fifty-global-financial-corporations-get-cracking-on-major-oil-gas-lending-exits/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=ieefa-from-zero-to-fifty-global-financial-corporations-get-cracking-on-major-oil-gas-lending-exits"">financial institutions are pulling out</a> because they recognize the many early signs of the fracking fallout: <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/shales-bust-shows-basis-of-boom-debt-debt-and-debt/2020/07/22/0e6ed98c-cc41-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html"">depressed prices</a>, <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-natural-gas-demand-peak/?srnd=green&amp;sref=piRJ9MA3"">peak gas demand</a>, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/shales-bust-shows-basis-of-boom-debt-debt-and-debt/2020/07/22/0e6ed98c-cc41-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html"">mounting debt</a>, <a href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/2020/10/15/bankruptcies-oil-gas-multi-billion-cleanup-bill-public?utm_source=DeSmog%20Weekly%20Newsletter"">record bankruptcies</a>, and <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Exxon-Mobil-Flags-Potential-Job-Cuts-in-Email-to-15666749.php"">industry-wide layoffs.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As aptly summarized <a href=""https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/4691da36-2e74-4c4c-99f0-19c3eee5ac9e/downloads/1d31iaaj6_122302.pdf?ver=1558223417346"">in a report by Pennsylvania nonprofit UrbanKind</a>, &ldquo;The benefits of fracking have not translated into widespread, long-term economic improvement.&rdquo; The very nature of fracking operations has ensured that this will continue to be true, and the long-term outlook of the industry only provides further evidence that our deepening reliance is more a liability than an asset.</p>

<p>Despite an abundance of evidence that the shale gas industry has failed our residents, Pennsylvania legislators lack the imagination to envision an economic future based on anything other than fossil fuels. In doing so, they write our state out of the clean energy future which most certainly lies ahead.</p>

<p>The age of fossil fuel dominance is over, and it is now time to listen to Pennsylvania residents demanding the reigning in of the fracking industry. We must redirect our precious state resources to industries that hold long-term economic promise and, beyond that, do not directly undermine public health, environmental protection, and climate stability.</p>

Clean Water Advocacy Forges Ahead Despite Pandemic,10/15/2020,"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has left its impact on all of us and continues to raise uncertainty at every corner, including in our clean water advocacy. Every year, in the spring, our clean water advocates from across the state travel to Harrisburg to educate elected officials on the importance of clean water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This spring, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we acted quickly with our partners to adapt the day-long event into a new socially distanced way of doing clean water advocacy. We created the first ever <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-partners-to-celebrate-PA-Clean-Water-Week"">PA Clean Water Week</a> and moved our meeting with legislators from the Capitol to the virtual, which now has become the norm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also looked to the first week of October to schedule an in-person Harrisburg event. However, six months later the pandemic still ensues. It turned out to be a good thing that we were already planning the first ever Fall Clean Water Education Day, because the General Assembly has to pass a fall supplemental budget. The &ldquo;annual&rdquo; budget passed by the General Assembly in June was for 5 months, allowing time for the state to react to the unfolding pandemic and its economic implications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is facing a nearly $5 billion revenue gap from last year and state legislators must pass a budget by the end of November to carry out this year&rsquo;s budget, which ends in June. With such a budget deficit, our clean water funding is in danger of serious cuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed, the Choose Clean Water Coalition, and partner organizations from western Pennsylvania met with our state legislators to talk about the importance of keeping funding for clean water in the Fall 2020 Supplemental Budget. In addition, we sent a letter with 38 signatories to Governor Wolf last week asking him to protect our clean water funding this fall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two years ago, clean water advocates <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/cleanwaterbriefingbook2019-01.pdf"">agreed on three priorities</a> for clean water funding.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Funding for the state&rsquo;s Natural Resources Agencies, such as DEP and DCNR</li>
	<li>Funding for the Interstate River Basin Commissions, such as DRBC and SRBC</li>
	<li>A Dedicated Source of Funding for Clean Water&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><u>Funding for the state&rsquo;s Natural Resources Agencies</u></p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) are tasked with several important roles related to clean water. Unfortunately, over the past couple decades they have witnessed significant budget cuts that impact their capacity. Since 2002, state funding for the DEP has been cut by nearly 40 percent, leading to a reduction of staff by 30 percent. And, General Fund support for DCNR has been slashed over the last 15 years, declining from $108.8 million in 2002-03 to a low of $14.5 million in 2014-15.</p>

<p>DEP is responsible for permitting activities that protect public health, such as drinking water and wastewater facilities. DEP is also responsible for permitting activities that may cause harm to our waterways, such as stormwater and construction site runoff. DEP also administers state and federal grant programs that put projects that protect our streams, such as the Environmental Stewardship Fund and Section 319 grants. Funding for DEP is essential for public health and clean water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DCNR oversees hundreds of programs and parks, greenways, open space, and natural areas, all which benefit our rivers and streams. Yet last year, the Pennsylvania Parks and Forests Foundation estimated that DCNR has a $1 billion infrastructure backlog due to a lack of state funding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Funding for DCNR is critical to the conservation of our waterways. Our public lands provide vast forested landscapes and natural infrastructure that benefit water quality. At its facilities, DCNR operates wastewater treatment systems as well as stormwater infrastructure. DCNR also administers the state&rsquo;s riparian forested buffer program for streamside trees.</p>

<p><u>Funding for the Interstate River Basin Commissions</u></p>

<p>Pennsylvania is part of five Interstate Basin Commissions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Delaware River Basin Commission&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Susquehanna River Basin Commission</li>
	<li>Interstate Commission for the Potomac River Basin</li>
	<li>Ohio River Valley Sanitation Commission</li>
	<li>Great Lakes Commission</li>
</ul>

<p>River Basin Commissions are agencies formed by interstate compact to serve state and federal government agencies that coordinate interstate waterway planning and management. The authority of each River Basin Commission varies but each may be responsible for overseeing water quality, flood control, wildlife, water flow, water withdrawals, aquatic flora, recreation, navigation, and industrial runoff in their respective basin. The health and prosperity of each river basin and its inhabitants relies on strong participation and supportive funding of member states in each River Basin Commission.</p>

<p><u>A Dedicated Source of Funding for Clean Water</u></p>

<p>The three leading sources of pollution into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways are (in descending order): runoff from agricultural lands, acid mine drainage from legacy coal mining, and stormwater runoff from developed surfaces. Because the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting system, established a mechanism for reducing pollution coming from industry and other types of facilities, much of the pollution that impacts our waterways is coming from nonpoint source pollution. To clean up this type of pollution, we need to put practices in place that keep the runoff from reaching our streams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A dedicated source of funding established for clean water projects would help farmers, local governments, conservation organizations, and others working across the Commonwealth to clean up our waterways and fund the projects necessary to do the job. Furthermore, the planning, design, construction, and long-term maintenance of clean water projects create and sustain employment opportunities.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<u>The Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program</u></p>

<p>In September 2020, <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1272"">Senator Yaw introduced SB 1272</a>, the Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program, or ACAP for short. This bill would provide funding assistance directly to farmers or landowners to implement conservation practices that protect or improve our waterways. ACAP would be overseen by the State Conservation Commission, however, decisions on funding projects and the application process would be handled at the local level by the County Conservation Districts. The ACAP program would provide funding to farmers statewide and funding to the counties would be proportional to the agricultural footprint of a county. The more farms, the more livestock and cropland, and the more impaired streams from agricultural sources, the more money a county would receive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The passage of ACAP is critical to improving our rivers and streams because it addresses Pennsylvania&rsquo;s leading source of stream impairment. Currently, ACAP sits in the Senate Agriculture &amp; Rural Affairs Committee and could make it to a vote in the full Senate this fall. SB 1272 proposes to create a program which is local, supported by farmers, and puts funding directly in the hands of farmers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Fertilizer Legislation</u></p>

<p>In addition to advocating for clean water funding in the budget, PennFuture is working to see SB 915 passed this fall. This bill would establish limits on fertilizers applied to grassy areas, such as lawns and turf. Establishing such limits would improve the health of our rivers and streams. The ground can only hold a limited amount of nutrients, or fertilizers. When grass is overfertilized beyond what can be absorbed by the soil, the excess will wash off into waterways or move down into the groundwater. Over 2,600 miles of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s streams are impaired due to excess nutrients.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Excess nutrients fuel plant and algae growth in our streams. When the algae die they can deplete the oxygen available to other life in the waterways, like fish and macroinvertebrates. Excess algae can also cloud the water, reducing the sunlight available to important vegetation that provide food, cover, and habitat for aquatic life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If passed, SB 915 will:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a level playing field for fertilizer companies across the state and protect local waters, moving towards one standard across the region and providing regional companies with similar market requirements to those in neighboring states.</li>
	<li>Limit how much nitrogen and phosphorus are applied to turf (grass).</li>
	<li>Establish a professional fertilizer applicator certification program, similar to pesticide applicators, that will ensure that professionals apply fertilizers at the proper rates, as established in this bill.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Develop an Agricultural and Homeowner Education Program to educate nonprofessional applicators on the proper rate of applying fertilizers.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Right now, this bill sits in the House Agriculture &amp; Rural Affairs Committee, which is led by a new chair, Representative Keller, from Perry County. It passed the Senate in late spring. With strong support behind the bill from many stakeholders, we hope to see this bill passed this fall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, there is no shortage of clean water advocacy needed this fall. Please stay tuned to our website, emails, and social media for updates on what you can do to help protect our waters.</p>

<p>Right now, <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/915alert"">you can follow this link asking your state Representative</a> to pass SB 915 and improve our waterways from excess nutrient pollution.&nbsp;</p>

Toxic Fracking Waste Becomes Mounting Problem for Downstream Communities,10/13/2020,"<p>We know the dangers of fracking operations &ndash; groundwater contamination, air quality issues, devastating health impacts &ndash; but what many might not realize is that the fracking industry is allowed to dispose of its wastes in landfills across Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, dangerous chemicals in fracking waste &ndash; such as radioactive materials &ndash; eventually make their way into Pennsylvania waters, threatening the health and safety of our communities and our streams.</p>

<p>The Marcellus Shale <a href=""http://vjel.vermontlaw.edu/files/2018/02/Geltman_FP-2.pdf"">is estimated to contain 10 to 100 parts per million (ppm) of uranium</a>, up to 33 times the national average. This unique geology means that rocks brought to the surface during Pennsylvania fracking operations likely have high levels of Radium-226. The industry calls this waste &ldquo;technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material&rdquo; (<a href=""https://www.epa.gov/radiation/technologically-enhanced-naturally-occurring-radioactive-materials-tenorm"">TENORM</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/radionuclides.pdf"">long-term implications of exposure to radium</a>, one of the radioactive chemicals found in fracking waste, communities are raising concerns. Clearly, greater scrutiny is needed &mdash; both of fracking operations and of the landfills that accept the industry&rsquo;s waste.</p>

<p>Although Pennsylvania landfills are not permitted to accept liquid waste, some 30 landfills in Pennsylvania and several in neighboring states accept drill cuttings from fracking sites. Pennsylvania landfills are required to screen drill cuttings to ensure they do not exceed maximum radioactivity levels. But what happens after the cuttings are admitted into the landfill?&nbsp;</p>

<p>When fracking waste combines with stormwater, the pool of leached water mixed with chemicals (&ldquo;leachate&rdquo;) may become a dangerously radioactive runoff, flowing into downstream treatment facilities or directly into nearby waterways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Landfills are required to treat leachate or somehow capture and transport it to other treatment facilities, but there are no requirements that landfills trace the leachate from fracking waste. This means that radioactive leachate may be threatening our waters without us knowing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>StateImpact Pennsylvania has found <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2019/09/11/how-did-fracking-contaminants-end-up-in-the-monongahela-river-a-loophole-in-the-law-might-be-to-blame/"">16 wastewater treatment plants take treated leachate from landfills</a>. Another 12 treatment plants are too small to be screened by DEP and instead, if they are at all taking action to treat or prevent the inflow of fracking leachate, do so voluntarily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public Herald <a href=""https://publicherald.org/pennsylvania-regulators-wont-say-where-66-of-landfill-leachate-w-radioactive-material-from-fracking-is-going-its-private/"">has also investigated these scenarios</a>, producing a map that <a href=""https://novarecollective.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=522c1a37d9f6430c8f05d6041b294af6"">shows the location of 30 landfills</a> likely to accept fracking waste and some 20 wastewater treatment plants that may be receiving the contaminated leachate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection declared <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=5815&amp;DocName=01%20PENNSYLVANIA%20DEPARTMENT%20OF%20ENVIRONMENTAL%20PROTECTION%20TENORM%20STUDY%20REPORT%20REV%201.PDF%20"">in a 2016 report that the public faced</a> &ldquo;little potential for radiation exposure&rdquo; from landfills receiving fracking waste. Defenders of the report later said any treatment plants that accept contaminated leachate <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2015/12/28/report-revives-debate-over-risks-of-radiation-from-drilling-waste/"">remove the radium</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the Westmoreland Sanitary Landfill, where the fracking industry deposited nearly 160,000 tons of drill cuttings, mud, and other fracking waste in 2018, has proven this was a faulty assumption and that the threat is real.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The landfill has been receiving fracking waste since 2010 and up until May 2019, leachate flowed downhill from the landfill, directly into the sewer, where it eventually made its way to the Belle Vernon Municipal Authority&rsquo;s treatment plant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authority reported that the leachate <a href=""http://www.paenvironmentdigest.com/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=49058&amp;SubjectID=83"">was killing bacteria intended to treat the wastewater</a>. Tests of the Monongahela River near the plant showed levels of radium at 8 picocuries per liter. The EPA standard for drinking water is 5.</p>

<p>Because of this highly contaminated leachate, the Authority cancelled its contract to treat the leachate from the landfill due to the fact that the leachate from the landfill had become untreatable and threated the water quality of the Monongahela. Since then, the landfill has been forced to truck its contaminated leachate to an out-of-state treatment facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The contaminated leachate also resulted in environmental litigation against the landfill and in February 2020, <a href=""https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/DEP_details.aspx?newsid=1313"">DEP issued a consent order with Westmoreland Sanitary Landfill,</a> charging the facility a $24,000 civil penalty and requiring actions to minimize leachate generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In May, the landfill <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2020/05/23/Westmoreland-County-landfill-seeks-approval-to-evaporate-contaminated-runoff/stories/202005220120"">announced plans to use an &ldquo;ultra-filtration&rdquo; system</a> to remove solids from the radium-rich leachate by evaporating it into the atmosphere &mdash; up to 45,000 gallons of leachate per day.&nbsp; PennFuture joined others in opposing this proposal citing the significant threat to human health and the environment from the resulting radon gases that are likely to be emitted through the evaporation process.</p>

<p>PennFuture argued that no approval should be issued unless and until DEP has sufficiently monitored, reviewed, considered, analyzed, and mitigated, if necessary, this threat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re continuing to monitor this matter as well as others to protect Pennsylvanians and our environment from the dangers &ndash; known and unknown &ndash; that the fracking and petrochemical industries pose.&nbsp;</p>

How a Clean Water Program is Addressing Equity in Philadelphia,10/5/2020,"<div>While testifying in front of <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Smith-Public-Testimony_200336_COVIDRecovery-1-.pdf"">Philadelphia City Council&rsquo;s Joint Committees on Finance and Commerce and Economic Development</a> about COVID-19 recovery strategies last week, I highlighted a strategy that Philadelphia can take to address the many interlocking crises the city is currently facing.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Whether it&rsquo;s the COVID-19 public health crisis, structural racism, economic downturn, or gun violence, one action can offer real solutions to them all: investing in green space. In particular, I sought to highlight how green space is addressing the structural inequality created by a practice known as redlining that black and brown neighborhoods were subject to during the 20th century.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Redlining was a practice that began in the 1930&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/redlining-what-is-history-mike-bloomberg-comments/"">where many banks in the U.S. denied mortgages to people,</a> mostly people of color in urban areas, preventing them from buying a home in certain neighborhoods or getting a loan to renovate their house. The practice was once backed by the U.S. government and occurred in many of the nation&rsquo;s largest cities with large minority populations.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>While the South had segregation and Jim Crow laws, the North had redlining. As part of the practice, financial firms, real estate agents and other parties demarcated geographic areas that were effectively off limits for issuing loans by literally using red ink to outline parts of the city. These areas were considered high risk of default. Riskier neighborhoods <a href=""https://whyy.org/segments/redlining-segregated-philadelphia/"">were predominantly Black and Latino</a>, but also recently immigrated European groups like Jews and Italians.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Redlining has had a devastating long-term impact on U.S. urban areas and Black people particularly. Redlining allowed for the systematic denial of various services by federal government agencies, local governments, as well as the private sector. It has also had <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/past-racist-redlining-practices-increased-climate-burden-on-minority-neighborhoods/"">a lasting environmental impact.</a> Redlined communities were often subject to air quality deterioration from urban highways, industrial plants and landfills. They are also more likely to experience extreme heats than other communities because of a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island effect.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The Urban Heat Island effect occurs in urbanized areas that experience higher temperatures than outlying neighborhoods because of a lack of green space and a high density in asphalt pavement and rooftops. The divestment from redlined neighborhoods also resulted in a lack of investment in green spaces from those same communities. In Philadelphia, these neighborhoods experience <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/philadelphia-heat-island-climate-change-hunting-park-20190724.html"">up to a 22 degree temperature difference</a> during hotter months of the year. These neighborhoods also have a greater amount of impervious surface that produces a larger amount of stormwater pollution.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In 2011 when Philadelphia implemented their Green City, Clean Waters plan, they did so recognizing the opportunities to reverse some of the historical divestment from Philadelphia&rsquo;s Black and Brown neighborhoods. Green City, Clean Waters is the City&rsquo;s Combined Sewer Overflow Compliance program. When Philadelphia first constructed its wastewater and stormwater system over 200 years ago, before enactment of the Clean Water Act, they relied on a combined sewer system model.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>While combined sewer systems were the standard wastewater/stormwater management practice during that time, with the increase in impervious surface, growth, and development, the sewer system can no longer withstand the amount of stormwater runoff entering the system. Traditionally, the solution is to invest in the construction of large tunnels, storage tanks, and wastewater treatment plant upgrades. The costs associated with the traditional approach were estimated to cost about $8-10 billion and would rely on large infrastructure companies that typically bring in high skilled labor from outside of the region to construct the infrastructure.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Green City, Clean Waters is a more cost effective alternative that is also bringing investment back to neighborhoods that often need it the most. The program relies on the implementation of green stormwater infrastructure - like rain gardens, tree trenches, and green roofs - to filter stormwater through plants, soil, and stones before it enters the combined sewer system. This water infrastructure investment is also creating green space and addressing the Urban Heat Island Effect.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Green City, Clean Waters <a href=""https://gsipartners.sbnphiladelphia.org/the-economic-social-and-environmental-case-for-green-city-clean-waters-an-update/"">provides approximately 1,000 local jobs annually</a> and creates a $4 million economic impact - creating local jobs and building a robust regional green economy. Research shows that access to green space <a href=""https://phys.org/news/2020-02-reveals-green-space-violent-crime.html"">reduces crime and blight</a>, increases opportunities to play and recreate, and <a href=""https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/translational/peph/webinars/green_spaces/index.cfm"">improves mental and physical health.</a>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Green stormwater infrastructure may not be able to solve the entirety of structural racism and its impact on Philadelphians, but investing in this innovative approach to stormwater management is one way the city is seeking to address the harm caused by racist housing policies.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PennFuture is a proud supporter of Green City, Clean Waters and the efforts the City of Philadelphia is taking to reinvest in historically neglected neighborhoods. Through it we are seeking to do our part in addressing racism and creating a healthier environment.</div>

An Admission and a Promise,10/1/2020,"<p>Angst and pain have been common themes for many of us in 2020, given the onset of a deadly pandemic interwoven with social unrest and a democracy that appears to be failing on multiple fronts. </p>

<p>To say that 2020 has been a year of tremendous upheaval and volatility is underselling it. This has been a year none of us will soon forget, and for good reason. </p>

<p>While this has been a difficult year for many of us, the fact remains that millions of people across the United States have been living with deep anxiety and frustration for far longer than just this calendar year. </p>

<p>For Black people, 2020 has been nothing more than the status quo, just another continuation of a long and systemic string of racial and environmental injustices perpetrated on entire segments of our population ad infinitum.</p>

<p>These are entire communities in our country that suffer on a daily basis, and have been subjugated for centuries. The racial unrest and tensions we’re seeing today are a direct result of being ignored, trampled upon and disregarded for entire lifetimes.</p>

<p>The United States is finally reckoning with the fact that black, indigenous, and other communities of color have been treated far different, and far worse, for far too long. </p>

<p>That reckoning is also happening at PennFuture, as we reflect internally on the role that we can play in ending racism. Since our inception in 1998, PennFuture has tried to advocate for every person who breathes air and drinks water in Pennsylvania, and that won’t change. </p>

<p>But, like many others, we’ve fallen short in our efforts to help build a truly equitable and just Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This is both an admission and a promise: an admission that the traditional environmental movement, including PennFuture, has largely remained silent on racial justice issues, and a promise that we will do better moving forward. We must do better moving forward. </p>

<p>The murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in May was the latest reminder that inaction and race-silent policies are no longer acceptable, but it’s not the only reminder. To that end, more than 1,000 people have been killed by police since 2013. Last year alone, <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2020-06-03/data-show-deaths-from-police-violence-disproportionately-affect-people-of-color"">54 percent of those who died</a> as a result of police violence were people of color.</p>

<p>So where do we go from here?</p>

<p>For starters, PennFuture created a new internal committee to explore these and other issues, and to outline the best path forward as we take this journey with a staff and board of directors of about 45 people.</p>

<p>Another step forward was to admit we needed help on this journey, so we are seeking expertise and guidance from outside experts and guides who will help shine a light on implicit biases and blind spots to help us transform PennFuture’s culture, and ensure we understand the operational and other practices that will make us a more welcoming and open organization to a greater diversity of individuals. </p>

<p>Finally, we decided to craft a heartfelt and meaningful statement that is meant to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

<p>This statement has gone through dozens of edits and revisions, and has been vetted by the entirety of PennFuture’s staff and board. We stand behind this statement, and it won’t simply be pasted on PennFuture’s website and forgotten. </p>

<p>Rather, this statement is a jumping-off point to a much larger internal discussion within PennFuture, the start of a long process to permanently transform the organization. That will not be quick or easy. Nor should it be. </p>

<p>If you’re interested in reading our solidarity statement,<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-releases-statement-showing-solidarity-with-Black-Lives-Matter-movement""> please click here</a>, or just continue reading. It is copied below for anyone who wishes to read it. </p>

<p>We plan on being forthright and honest as this process unfolds, and we appreciate your patience as we work through these delicate and imminently important issues. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size:16px;""><u><strong>PennFuture Solidarity Statement</strong></u></span></p>

<p>George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Darrell Banks. Tony McDade. Atatiana Jefferson. Nina Adams. Antwon Rose. Tamir Rice. Ricardo Giddings. Brandon Tate Brown: Ten Black lives stolen by police in recent years, among the more than 1,000 people that police have killed since 2013. Last year alone, 54 percent of those who died as a result of police violence were people of color. </p>

<p>These are lives cut short because of systemic racism in American society. The murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police is yet another reminder of this seemingly intractable racism, his dying words – “I can’t breathe” – literal and figurative assertions of generation after generation of suffocating injustices.</p>

<p>In the wake of George Floyd’s death, we have seen black communities protesting state-sanctioned police violence only to be met with tear gas, rubber bullets, and a militarized police force. PennFuture stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in the fight to end violence and all other manifestations of systemic racism. We do this in part because we recognize the connections between racism and the protection of clean air, water, and land. </p>

<p>Black, brown, and indigenous communities are disproportionately burdened by polluting refineries, contaminated water, and toxic dumping. This is environmental racism. Black children are twice as likely to have asthma as white children. This is environmental racism. Movements of black people in public parks and open spaces are policed and controlled. This is environmental racism. And environmental racism is systematically causing the premature death of black people and other people of color. </p>

<p>In the face of overwhelming evidence of environmental racism, the traditional environmental movement, including PennFuture, has largely remained silent on racial justice issues. That is, until recently. At PennFuture, we have begun the long process of actively incorporating anti-racist practices. With expert guidance, our team will begin to shine a light on implicit biases and blind spots to transform PennFuture from the inside out.</p>

<p>We grieve for the lives lost, the communities trampled, and the voices silenced by racism in this country. We are committed to uncovering the root causes of this suffering and repairing the harms after decades of silence. In solidarity with Black Lives Matter, we embrace an inclusive and equitable environmentalism that affirms all Pennsylvanians’ rights to a healthy environment. </p>

<p>In peace and solidarity, </p>

Creative Civic Engagement During the Pandemic,9/30/2020,"<p>The 2020 election is just about one month away. Many voters are highly engaged as the stakes are so high for the values we each hold personally dear for our families, our communities, state and country.</p>

<p>As an advocacy organization active with state and federal policy, in legislatures and the courts,&nbsp; PennFuture views participation in voting as strategic to the environmental outcomes we work toward. So we moved more intentionally into democracy work to ensure that this aspect of our democracy is optimized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want everyone who is eligible to vote to be registered to vote, and we work to be sure that those who are registered to vote are able to do so safely, free of intimidation and in as informed a way as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s Democracy for All program focuses on non-partisan voter registration, voter education, voter engagement and get-out-the vote work. It is aimed at individuals of color, millennials and single women, a group of voters sometimes referred to as the New American Majority or Rising American Electorate.</p>

<p>Last summer, when we were planning our non-partisan voter registration program, we envisioned a tried and true model that would be deploying canvassers into the field, armed with iPads or tablets, and electronically registering eligible individuals in person. COVID-19&nbsp;upended that model as our need to provide for the safety of our staff and contractors became a paramount consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We held out hope until the last possible minute to run an in-person program but the persistence of the pandemic and contagion of the virus made it too difficult.</p>

<p>Our team needed to get creative and pivot our tactics. Despite all of these restrictions and limitations, we are still out in Pennsylvania communities registering people to vote in the most important election in recent memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some highlights:</p>

	<li>The team <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/IMG_0781.jpg"">recently formed a voter registration caravan</a> that made its way through the Wyoming Valley, the Poconos and Lehigh Valley on a rainy Saturday. Attached to the vehicles were magnetic signs featuring bar codes that a viewer can aim her/his/its smart phone at and be directed to a voter registration website. The caravan <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/IMG_0779.jpg"">ended in Allentown</a> where it drove by a rally and march for Breonna Taylor.</li>
	<li>The team is also deploying texting and calling to promote voter registration. <a href=""https://www.democracyforall-pennfuture.com/register-2-vote"">October 19, 2020 is the last day to register to vote in the November 3, 2020 elections</a>. After that date the Democracy for All program will pivot to get-out-the-vote efforts.&nbsp;</li>

<p>PennFuture is dedicated to fighting for clean air, clean water and a healthy environment, and our Democracy for All program is equally dedicated to ensuring that disenfranchised communities in Pennsylvania make their voices heard by voting in all elections.</p>

<p>We are reminded of the words of the Honorable John Lewis,&nbsp; &quot;Voting and participating in the democratic process are key. The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no better way to change the present and forge a better future than by voting. Here&rsquo;s to hoping everyone who is eligible registers to vote, and there&rsquo;s no better time to register than right now.</p>

Fossil Fuel Polluters and Friends Ramp Up New Attack on Solar Energy in Pa.,9/29/2020,"<p>Fossil fuel polluters and their enablers in the legislature have been ramping up a new attack on solar energy in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Rep. Chris Dush, one of the most notorious climate deniers in the state&nbsp; House of Representatives, led this charge in a recent House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee meeting with a speech <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/repdush/videos/354190742292978/"">that was either intentionally dishonest or profoundly ignorant.</a></p>

<p>He began by claiming that coal is &ldquo;just compost&rdquo; and is &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; whereas solar panels make use of &ldquo;man-made chemical compounds&rdquo; that are toxic.</p>

<p>Right from the start we recognize the &ldquo;appeal to nature&rdquo; fallacy.&nbsp;As much as advertising tries to convince us that anything &ldquo;natural&rdquo; must be safe, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.&nbsp;Everyone knows not to go out and randomly pick mushrooms to eat, we call the plant &ldquo;poison&rdquo; ivy for a reason, and we rush to the hospital if we are bitten by a venomous snake or spider.&nbsp;It should also be no surprise to anyone that coal is one of the things the EPA <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home"">specifically recommends not putting on your compost pile.</a></p>

<p>Rep. Dush may call it &ldquo;compost,&rdquo; but coal can contain arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, cyanide, lead, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and a host of other toxic and radioactive chemicals. When burnt, it releases tons of cancer-causing fine particulates, precursors of ozone smog, the sulfur dioxide that leads to acid rain, and carbon pollution that contributes to climate change.&nbsp;Afterwards, we are left with vast amounts of toxic ash that must be disposed of.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the new pollution coal is responsible for every day, Pennsylvania is still struggling to cope with the result of decades of coal use.&nbsp;We have billions of tons of waste coal piles polluting our land and water and, as Rep. Dush even admits, a huge number of streams that were rendered effectively dead because of acid mine drainage.&nbsp;Of all people, our representatives should know the difference between compost and pollution.</p>

<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-98743cb3-7fff-b064-fc09-d48d133ff018""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><span style=""border:none;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:485px;height:365px;""><img height=""365"" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wZMJl4xdoYSz_FvTx5f0AfrxYH1UMg_-AFMYhyNYbvezcrpRrzY7WhfpE33HAkZrYpkHfjbHI6O3cJMusIS9wbyODg230_UshuYlUzh8c5OxxFJHbD6lyU_D9b0dOnNNmJNvjCmi"" style=""margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;"" width=""485"" /></span></span></span></p>

<p><em>Above: More than 45 tons of acid along with thousands of pounds of aluminum and manganese drain from the Jeddo Tunnel into the Little Nescopeck and into the Susquehanna River every day.</em></p>

<p>Fracked&nbsp;gas may contain fewer toxics and heavy metals as coal, but it&rsquo;s hardly safe either.&nbsp;We know waste from drilling operations contains toxic and radioactive material, but the scary part is what we don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;A 2018 report <a href=""https://www.pfpi.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PASecretFrackingChemicalsReportPFPI9.10.2018.pdf"">on the use of trade secret rules</a> to avoid disclosing the chemicals used in the drilling process noted that secret chemicals were used in more than half of the wells drilled.</p>

<p>In 2019, Trump&rsquo;s Environmental Protection Agency&nbsp;issued its recommendation <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-04/documents/management_of_exploration_development_and_production_wastes_4-23-19.pdf"">to exempt oil and gas waste from regulation</a> under the Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)&mdash;despite explicitly saying that exemption &ldquo;does not mean that these wastes cannot cause harm to human health.&rdquo; The rationale for this exemption included the claims that regulation could create &ldquo;delays for exploration and production operations&rdquo;, and perhaps more tellingly that &ldquo;the large waste volumes generated could severely strain capacity at existing Subtitle C facilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How large are these waste volumes?&nbsp;We know data from the PA Department of Environmental Protection indicates that in 2018 alone over 230,000 tons of waste from oil and gas operations was disposed of in Pennsylvania landfills. This included drill cutting, contaminated soil, spent lubricants, and drilling fluid waste along with other chemicals and radioactive materials. Of course, when Rep. Dush testified that he is &ldquo;not too far from a massive landfill&rdquo; and he doesn&rsquo;t want to see &ldquo;negative environmental impacts&rdquo; from disposing of solar panels, he made no mention of the existing waste problem from the natural gas industry.</p>

<p>In order to generate 230,000 tons of waste from solar panels we would need to throw away about seven times the number solar panels installed in Pennsylvania today&mdash;and repeat that again year after year.&nbsp;In reality panels can have an expected life of more than thirty years, so the actual number that are taken out of service in any one year is tiny.&nbsp;To even get close to the volume of waste created by fracking, we would need several hundred times the amount of solar as we have today and decide, for some reason, to recycle none of the panels when they are retired.</p>

<p>No energy source can ever be perfect, but from an environmental perspective solar is pretty good. More than 90 percent by weight of solar panels is glass, plastic, and aluminum, which is already recyclable and not considered hazardous waste.&nbsp;Everyone agrees that the small amount of other compounds like silver, tin, lead, and other trace compounds need to be either disposed of properly or recycled.&nbsp;Fortunately the rare elements also tend to be commercially valuable so there is a lot of <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-020-0645-2.epdf?sharing_token=gTbOszbDSFo3DPHaqB2oKtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OtL9QEzcgFMYa45OUzo4NruhWqFy6wgWcztDdWim4XS3hCVOCBhp4d3QDIeKJkRd1qE3jMWfn99b10OTnspoqOjZXZdVAs0r5jaR6vhHiEl_Yr8DM9BCYUFb15u73ruAc%3D"">interest and research in developing effective recycling technology.</a></p>

<p>Even with the appropriate technology in place, recycling can&rsquo;t be cost-effective unless there is a sufficient stream of material to process. This is one area where the long life span of solar systems creates a challenge.&nbsp;As the market for solar grows, so will the recycling businesses. But, instead of irresponsibly spreading fear and doubt while shilling for fossil fuels, our legislators could work to advance solar generation and, in doing so, welcome this new supporting industry to the state.</p>

"Trump's Energy Secretary Denies Human-Made Climate Change, Promotes Petrochemicals During Beaver County Visit",9/28/2020,"<p>As the election approaches, it seems national politics have converged on Southwestern Pennsylvania, each visiting politician equipped with a different sales pitch for opposing futures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette visited earlier this week, his vision was unambiguous. The Shell petrochemical complex in Beaver County, Brouillette said, is the &ldquo;future of the American economy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What his vision didn&rsquo;t include, however, was even a basic understanding of climate change. In response to questions about the scientific consensus of human-caused climate change, <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/09/21/trumps-energy-secretary-questions-mainstream-science-on-human-impacts-of-climate-change/"">he arrogantly responded that &ldquo;no one knows that.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>The secretary is right about one thing, though: A petrochemical future requires absolute climate denial. This is because the petrochemical industry <a href=""https://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/09/04/opinion/sorry-break-it-you-futures-not-plastics"">intends to double its carbon emisssions</a> just as other industries and sectors get serious about taking climate action.</p>

<p>According to Brouillette, it is unrealistic to even consider serious climate action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today in the marketplace, renewable power is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels and nuclear technology,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/story/news/2020/09/21/u-s-secretary-energy-beaver-county/5855131002/"">he told reporters</a>. &ldquo;No one wants to say that out loud because it sounds politically incorrect at times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead, his Department has taken an &ldquo;all of the above&rdquo; approach to energy development that, in practice, means climate denial, understating the potential of renewable technologies, and an all-out endorsement of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>As if having a climate change-denying energy secretary wasn&rsquo;t enough, Brouillette quickly showed that he lacks even a basic understanding of our economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The petrochemical industry that he touts as &ldquo;the future of the American economy&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/2020/04/16/oil-gas-petrochemical-financial-woes-pandemic-ciel-report"">was under extreme financial duress even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit</a>. It&rsquo;s an industry that <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fracked-Gas-and-Petrochemical-Industries-Jockeying-for-Stimulus-Recovery-Funds"">relies on taxpayer handouts merely to stay afloat</a>, an industry dependent upon <a href=""https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Big-Oils-Risky-Plastic-Bet-Could-Lead-To-400-Billion-In-Stranded-Assets.html"">a nearly impossible increase in plastics demand.</a> Faced with pending market oversupply, billions of dollars worth of petrochemical projects <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2020/07/13/petrochemical-projects-on-hold.html"">have already been abandoned or put on hold.</a></p>

<p>To obscure the ongoing failures of the fracked gas and petrochemical industry, Brouillette <a href=""https://triblive.com/opinion/dan-brouillette-and-peter-navarro-trumps-manufacturing-energy-revival-supports-pa-workers/"">grossly exaggerates the number of Pennsylvania oil and gas jobs</a>, using an <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/09/10/at-western-pa-gas-drilling-site-pence-talks-jobs-repeats-falsehoods-on-bidens-fracking-position/"">oft-repeated and debunked claim</a> that overstates the number by at least 600 percent. He then falsely claims that the petrochemical industry <a href=""https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/cracked-case-green-jobs-over-petrochemicals-pennsylvania"">would bring up to 100,000 new jobs to Pennsylvania.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the fact that the fossil fuel industry has been forced into a nationwide stagnation resulting <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/how-top-oil-companies-are-responding-to-the-price-shock-2020-3"">in layoffs</a>, <a href=""https://ieefa.org/sp-u-s-oil-and-gas-industry-distressed-debt-now-at-all-time-high/"">debt,</a> and <a href=""https://www.visualcapitalist.com/tracking-the-growing-wave-of-oil-gas-bankruptcies-in-2020/"">bankruptcy</a> has not deterred Brouillette&rsquo;s enthusiasm, even as the so-called &ldquo;energy companies&rdquo; increasingly turn towards non-energy products like plastics, fertilizers, and other chemicals for profit growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet Brouillette and his Department of Energy continue to promote the development of an Appalachian petrochemical hub, despite or perhaps because of the industry&#39;s continued struggle to get off the ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secretary Brouillette&rsquo;s personalized tour of the Shell Petrochemical Plant last week was in fact preceded <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/articles/appalachian-energy-and-petrochemical-renaissance"">by a June 2020 report</a> on the future of petrochemicals in Appalachia, stressing the necessity of maximizing public support for the industry. The report says that regional petrochemical growth requires the public sector to abandon its &ldquo;business-as-usual&rdquo; approach and embrace the industry with public (i.e. taxpayer) investment, supportive policies, and propaganda about the potential economic opportunity.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, this means <a href=""https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/shell-cracks-pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-tax-code#:~:text=The%20legislation%20did%20not%20name,what%20Shell%20plans%20to%20do."">a $1.65 billion tax break for Shell Petrochemicals</a>, a <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/07/14/Pennsylvania-petrochemical-tax-credit-fertilizer-dry-natural-gas-Marcellus-Utica-fracking/stories/202007140122"">$667.5 million tax break for qualifying petrochemical plants</a>, and a persistent misinformation campaign about <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/frack-check-trump-inflates-pennsylvania-fracking-job-figures-by-3500-percent/Content?oid=17937555"">the number of fracking jobs in the state.</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The competitive aspects of [the Shell Petrochemical Plant] is just enormous,&rdquo; he assured reporters last week, as his dystopian vision of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s future materialized before his eyes. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see competitors to Shell show up in the very near future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It goes to show that, regardless of the end product, Brouillette&rsquo;s Energy Department is more invested in fossil fuel exploitation than it is in securing a secure and sustainable energy supply for our country.</p>

LNG in PA Blog #5: Public opposition grows to proposed LNG shipping terminals,9/25/2020,"<p>Before New Fortress Energy announced their risky plan to ship millions of gallons of liquified natural gas across the state&rsquo;s rail lines, perhaps they should have consulted with the emergency responders who would have to clean up a spill or one of many other potential catastrophes the project could bring.</p>

<p>With no risk assessment, no public safety analysis and no environmental review of the potential hazards to communities along the possible LNG transport routes, a growing chorus of local officials are denouncing the New Fortress Energy plan and insisting that state regulators stop the scheme in its tracks.</p>

<p>Over the past month, resolutions opposing the local transportation of LNG by rail or truck were approved by <a href=""https://legistarweb-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/pdf/694747/Resolution-2020_Opposing_Transportation_of_Liquefied_Natural_Gas.pdf"">Scranton City Council</a> and <a href=""https://delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/copies_four_reso.pdf"">Clarks Summit Borough Council</a> in Lackawanna County, <a href=""https://delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/copies_four_reso.pdf"">Kutztown Borough Council</a> in Berks County, and the <a href=""https://delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/copies_four_reso.pdf"">Lehigh County Board of Commissioners</a>. Similar concern is being raised by four at-large members of <a href=""https://delawareriverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/letter from officials in Philly.pdf"">Philadelphia City Council</a> and a member of the Pennsylvania House representing Northeast Philadelphia, citing the overwhelming hazards to residents with no benefits.</p>

<p>In addition to denouncing the inherent risks of LNG ground transport, these resolutions and letters of opposition are requesting the Delaware River Basin Commission deny New Fortress Energy&rsquo;s permit to build an LNG shipping terminal. If approved, the Gibbstown, New Jersey terminal would be the last major hurdle for <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-4-Liquified-Natural-Gas-Should-Not-Become-the-New-Bomb-Trains-to-Threaten-Our-Communities"">so-called &ldquo;bomb trains&rdquo; to carry dangerous LNG</a> through unprepared communities from a proposed facility in Wyalusing, Bradford County.</p>

<p>PennFuture joined with over 120 other organizations in demanding that the DRBC, the multi-state regulatory agency tasked with protecting waters of the Delaware River, reject the permit that would allow LNG to be exported from an expanded Gibbstown facility.&nbsp; The DRBC also received more than 71,000 petition signatures to stop the project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clearly, public opposition is having an effect. Earlier this month, three of the state commissioners <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/business/philadelphia-lng-gibbstown-new-fortress-energy-port-drbc-fracking-trains-20200920.html"">voted to delay approval and to stay any further construction</a> until DRBC issues a final permit decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture welcomes the decision by the governors of Delaware, New Jersey and New York (Pennsylvania abstained) to take a &ldquo;careful look&rdquo; at the dangers of LNG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shipping LNG by rail or by train is dangerous on multiple levels. In addition to the risks of an accident during transport, LNG opens new markets to fracked gas, perpetuating the industry&rsquo;s disastrous environmental footprint throughout Pennsylvania. LNG production and distribution results in greater emissions, hazards and energy use by adding major steps to the supply chain between well heads and consumers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the region determines our energy future, neither the Wyalusing production facility or Gibbstown shipping terminal should be part of the path forward. DRBC and local and state leaders should listen to public concern and prevent these wrong-minded projects from moving ahead.</p>

Stonycreek River Restoration Shows Power of Conservation Efforts,9/16/2020,"<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: Melissa Reckner is one of 11 amazing women being honored during PennFuture&rsquo;s 2020 <strong>&ldquo;Women in Conservation&rdquo;</strong> event on Oct. 8. For more information, and for ticket info, <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/wic2020virtual/index.html"">please click this link now!</a>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Growing up along the Stonycreek River in northern Somerset County, I experienced a waterway that was orange, slimy, and largely devoid of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thirty years later, I can go back to those riverbanks and overlook a much cleaner Stonycreek<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>one that harbors a growing diversity of fish, attracts whitewater enthusiasts from over a dozen states, and is often heralded as a &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; success story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, this fairy tale is far from over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2018, I published the <a href=""https://conemaughvalleyconservancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SOW_FINALElectronic.pdf"">State of the Kiski-Conemaugh River Watershed: Community Shift</a>, a document that quantified changes in this 1,888 square-mile watershed, which includes the Stonycreek River. This document shows how water chemistry and fish assemblages have changed in this basin&rsquo;s major rivers and highlights the watershed organizations that work with local, state, and federal agencies to make streams healthier, net alkaline, diverse, and attractive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many people have commented how they did not think this could happen in their lifetime and proves that Mother Nature just needs a helping hand, which has come from countless professional and volunteer hours, millions of dollars, and dozens of projects.</p>

<p>While treatment systems have remediated a lot of Abandoned Mine Drainage (AMD)<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>once the number one source of pollution in Western Pennsylvania - these systems require routine maintenance and do have life spans that must be addressed before they fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flushing pipes, removing animal obstructions, replenishing compost and limestone, collecting samples, cutting vegetation, and similar chores are not necessarily fun tasks, but they are necessary in keeping these life-sustaining projects going. Even one day of failure could kill aquatic life, coat streams with iron and aluminum oxides, and ruin decades of work and restoration.</p>

<p>The work of ensuring this does not happen often falls to watershed associations, conservation districts, and similar organizations that don&rsquo;t necessarily have the funds, expertise, or staff to see to these tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Partnerships help alleviate the pressure, but many are in the same boat<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>trying to do a lot with a little and often with an aging volunteer base. And despite years of education and awareness, there is still a disconnect between those communities downstream<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>the ones receiving the benefits of labor completed in headwater streams with some contributors aligning their areas of interests to political, not geographic boundaries or grantors wanting to fund the new, hip project, when basic operations and maintenance are needed.</p>

<p>Watershed groups and similar organizations will continue to see to these tasks, while trying to be innovative, fresh, and creative, but they could use support through the gifting of individuals&rsquo; time, talents, and treasures. We all live in a watershed and there are many ways in which people may get involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>People are needed to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Serve on organizational boards so business may be conducted&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Generate enthusiasm and new ideas</li>
	<li>Assist with research, construction, or service projects</li>
	<li>Use their connections and solicit memberships and donations</li>
	<li>Write and manage grants &ndash; do the paperwork and spreadsheets!</li>
	<li>Maintain the group&rsquo;s social media presence&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Correspond with local and regional media</li>
	<li>Plan and help with events, like litter cleanups or recycling days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone has a skill set that can be beneficial to conservation organizations. No doubt, picking up litter, for example, is not the most fun, but working with a great group of people makes it more enjoyable and the feeling of satisfaction afterwards is very rewarding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not all work and no play! Celebrations are necessary to pause and promote reflection on hard-fought accomplishments, recognize the story this work is fashioning, strengthen the sense of comradery that comes from working with awesome people, and share the joy in knowing the world is a little better because a watershed group believed it could make a difference. They are also an opportunity to look to the future, theorizing ways our environment and people&rsquo;s connection to it could be stronger. Plus, you need days to reap the rewards of your work and restore your soul; maybe cast a line and do an informal &ldquo;fish survey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been blessed to work and volunteer with organizations that spearheaded restoration projects and initiatives that have brought life back to my Stonycreek<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>a river that I still call home<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>and many more waterways, and I&rsquo;m driven to see more stream miles restored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a couple significant tributaries to the Stonycreek, for instance, that have seemingly insurmountable pollution problems, but I think fairy tales can come true with hard work, passion, and persistence.</p>

"Despite roadblocks from Legislature, RGGI rulemaking process advances",9/15/2020,"<p>In February, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fallacy-Fiction-and-Falsehoods-Debunking-RGGI-Myths-Part-1"">PennFuture&nbsp;wrote a blog post</a> debunking a number of myths surrounding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s future participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). In the seven months since that time, we have some more modeling data and new insights into the benefits of RGGI, but the fossil fuel industry and their friends are still spreading many of the same myths, and sometimes outright lies, to kill the program before it starts.</p>

<p>Particularly in the Legislature, the bias is so blatant it would be comical if the issue was not so serious.&nbsp;Representative Daryl Metcalfe has held several hearings in the House Environmental Resources and Energy committee where he only invited notorious climate deniers, fossil fuel industry advocates, and anti-RGGI speakers to attend. Rep. Metcalf also angrily upbraided the committee&rsquo;s minority chair for pointing out the minority wasn&rsquo;t given the customary courtesy of inviting speakers or even making opening remarks.</p>

<p>The Senate followed this pattern by having a hearing that they pretended was about the impacts of RGGI on employment, but didn&rsquo;t invite any of the hundreds of employees from the Beaver Valley nuclear plant whose jobs have already been saved by RGGI.&nbsp;They also ignored the fact that RGGI is expected to result in a net increase of 27,000 Pennsylvania jobs and didn&rsquo;t talk to anyone from the industries that will see the most growth, they only talked to workers in a limited subset of the fossil fuel industry.</p>

<p>The Legislature didn&rsquo;t stop there.&nbsp;They have also pushed bills not just to limit the DEP&rsquo;s authority to adopt a cap-and-invest program, but also to stop practically any action at all to address the growing climate crisis.&nbsp;Fortunately, while these bills passed in the Legislature, they didn&rsquo;t garner the support of two-thirds of the legislature so it is doubtful proponents will garner enough votes to override Governor Wolf&rsquo;s expected veto.</p>

<p>Although the RGGI proposal has already received unprecedented scrutiny before external reviewers, advisory committees, the Legislature, and in the media, we constantly hear the refrain from the opposition that the people need to have their voice heard.&nbsp;As those making such claims should know, the Regulatory Review Act (RRA) has detailed requirements for just such public participation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact this was always a disingenuous claim intended to disrupt the process is clear. The Environmental Quality Board (EQB) was asked on September 15, 2020 to formally open a public 60-day public comment period and hold at least five public hearings on the proposed rule (both more than what is required under the RRA) and the opposition opposed doing so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, a majority of the EQB members did see the need to initiate the full public participation process and voted to formally propose the rule. With that vote the DEP can move forward and give everyone the opportunity to submit written comments or testify at one of several public hearings.&nbsp;These comments&mdash;along with responses provided by the DEP&mdash;will all become part of the official record as the package moves forward and will also be made available to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that, as much as the fossil fuel industry and their friends try, they cannot refute the fundamental truth that coal generation is failing in Pennsylvania and nationwide because it can&rsquo;t compete with cheaper alternatives&mdash;primarily natural gas but increasingly wind and solar energy as well. They may lie to workers and pretend that these coal jobs will be around for years to come, but their actions of the industry and those of their financiers speak louder than words. If they believed that coal could be competitive, we would see investments in new plants&mdash;we aren&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some may hope new technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) will make it possible to burn coal without emitting huge amounts of greenhouse gasses, but for all its potential benefits, CCS isn&rsquo;t going to make coal generation cheaper. Ignoring the facts and wishing things were different won&rsquo;t reverse the decline of coal generation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, we have the opportunity to invest in sustainable alternatives, which can happen by implementing a cap-and-invest program compatible with RGGI as the EQB&nbsp;has just proposed. As Senator Santarsiero pointed out at the EQB meeting, polls <a href=""https://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/new-pa-poll-72-of-pennsylvania-voters.html"">have repeatedly shown</a> that strong majorities of Pennsylvanian&rsquo;s support strong policies like these to promote clean air and cut carbon pollution.&nbsp;Now is the time for their voices to be heard.</p>

<p>The Legislature could, of course, play a constructive role in reducing carbon emissions, providing sustainable jobs for our workers, and supporting communities impacted by the inevitable closure of coal-fired power plants.&nbsp;Two bills have been introduced that would do just that&mdash;SB15 (Costa) in the Senate and HB 2856 (Comitta) in the House both take just such an approach.</p>

<p>PennFuture looks forward to championing both bills, and the ongoing rulemaking process surrounding the proposed cap-and-invest program in Pennsylvania.</p>

LNG in PA Blog #4: Liquified Natural Gas Should Not Become the New Bomb Trains to Threaten Our Communities,9/9/2020,"<p>Communities across Eastern Pennsylvania are at the center of a new debate over whether fracked gas and its byproducts, specifically liquified natural gas (LNG), can be safely produced and transported to new markets. As the LNG project in Bradford County moves ahead, the debate will morph into an experiment in freight design and fuel transport. Put simply, those who live along Pennsylvania&rsquo;s rail lines will be at risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following federal approval in July, the first bulk transport of LNG by rail will potentially travel from Wyalusing to an export terminal in Gloucester County, New Jersey, crossing through the Wyoming, Lehigh and Delaware valleys along the way.</p>

<p>On August 18, <a href=""https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/state-impact/press-publications/press-releases/lng-by-rail-challenge"">Pennsylvania joined 14 state attorney generals</a> to sue the federal government on grounds that shipping LNG by rail is absurdly dangerous. On the same day, <a href=""https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LNG-by-Rail-enviros-petition-for-review.pdf"">a coalition of environmental groups</a> likewise challenged the health and safety of the U.S. Department of Transportation&rsquo;s new LNG-by-rail regulations.</p>

<p>Petitioners argue LNG transport rules, finalized by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) on July 24, fail to offer sufficient public safety rules and lack evaluation of environmental impacts. Attorney General Josh Shapiro described LNG rail transport as &ldquo;extremely dangerous&rdquo; and potentially &ldquo;explosive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Transporting LNG would risk creating &ldquo;bomb trains,&rdquo; posing new hazards to communities and habitats along its path. Read PennFuture&rsquo;s previous articles <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">describing the&nbsp;basics of LNG</a> and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">detailing the threats posed by transporting LNG on rail.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PHMSA rule <a href=""https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=PHMSA-2018-0025-0480"">allows LNG to travel by rail in tanker cars</a> never before used to transport LNG. DOT-113 cars would need to add enhanced, thicker carbon steel outer tanks. These enhancements would make the cars heavier than almost any other freight. How these enhanced tanker cars would withstand a rail accident remains unknown.</p>

<p>Bomb trains would be subject to a new speed limit of up to 50 mph. Yet the limit would be voluntary. Federal Railroad Administration officials have noted tank cars are unlikely to survive impacts at even 30 mph.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=PHMSA-2018-0025-0078"">The National Transportation Safety Board</a> and <a href=""https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=PHMSA-2018-0025-0096"">the National Association of State Fire Marshals</a> have both objected to the PHMSA rule. PHMSA claims DOT-113 cars have a track record of transporting other cryogenic flammable materials. But these cars have experienced numerous failures while transporting other, less dangerous cargoes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A study by <a href=""https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/newsletterdl.aspx?id=460"">University of Wyoming professor Charles Mason</a>&mdash;paid for by the Charles Koch Foundation&mdash;acknowledges the danger of rail transport of crude oil. From 2010 to 2016, the study tracked 75 oil spill incidents. Although the spill rate has fallen in recent years, at its peak rail-related spills occurred once for every 1-2 million barrels (about 90 million gallons) shipped.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania LNG plant developer, New Fortress Energy, plans to ship 3.5 million gallons of LNG per day by either freight or truck. That&rsquo;s equivalent to three rail tank cars per day. Recently, <a href=""http://www.lrwy.net/index.php/latest-news"">Lehigh Railway announced a five-year lease</a> to TranZ, &ldquo;a bulk material handling company serving the needs of the energy industry,&rdquo; to operate a rail-truck transfer station in Wyalusing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exact route LNG trains would take is not yet public information, <a href=""https://www.delawareriverkeeper.org/ongoing-issues/lng-gibbstown-interactive-map"">but Delaware Riverkeeper Network maps out</a> two potential routes.</p>

<p>From the Wyalusing plant, Lehigh Railway would carry the bomb trains until the railway interchanges with the Reading &amp; Northern Railroad lines at Mehoopany in Wyoming County. From there, trains would likely travel alongside the Susquehanna River through Lackawanna and Luzerne counties, then south through Carbon, Schuylkill and Berks counties. Once arriving in Reading, cargo would travel along a Norfolk Southern line to Philadelphia or via Trenton. <a href=""https://gis.penndot.gov/BPR_pdf_files/MAPS/Statewide/parail.pdf"">See the Pennsylvania Railroad Map.</a></p>

<p>PennFuture fully supports this litigation aimed at protecting our communities and environment from the threat of bomb trains carrying the highly explosive LNG. We will be sure to update you with any information and will continue to do all we can to limit this threat from LNG in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

LNG in PA Blog #3: Protect Northern PA,9/3/2020,"<p><em>Editor&#39;s Note: This is the third installment of the LNG in PA blog series. The first blog answered the question, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">What is Liquefied Natural Gas?</a> and the second blog, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-2-Bomb-Trains-Through-Pennsylvania"">Bomb Trains Through Pennsylvania</a>, revealed the dangers of transporting LNG by rail.&nbsp;In this blog, guest writer and PennFuture board member Diana Dakey shares her experiences in the ongoing fight against the construction of a dry LNG facility in Bradford County, PA.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>In the second half of 2019, news slowly trickled out that a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) plant was permitted by DEP and received the necessary zoning conditions from Wyalusing Township in Bradford County, PA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People in surrounding counties who learned about the project argued the public was not consulted in the decision-making process to put up an industrial plant that will impact several counties and two states.&nbsp;Concerned people started researching the issue and formed a committee: Protect Northern PA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we considered what to call ourselves, we agreed that the concept of protection is key. If a massively dangerous project could (and did) get approved, what else might?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protect Northern PA realized that the threat is fracked-gas industrialization.&nbsp;There is a harmful feedback loop at play in Northern PA. Cheap and plentiful fracked gas attracts industrial promoters who want to process that gas.&nbsp;The fracking companies need to find new outlets for their gas. As Pennsylvania allows gas processing plants to be built, demand for fracking increases. The feedback loop is established.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A company called New Fortress Energy LLC, with a local subsidiary called Bradford County Real Estate Partners LLC, is poised to start building an LNG plant in the historic Browntown district of Wyalusing Township, between Route 6 and the Susquehanna River.&nbsp;Valuable historical resources are being lost. Browntown was the site of the Friedenshutten settlement of Moravians and Susquehannocks in the 1700s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why this project in this place?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The New Fortress Energy scheme claims to have a plan to make LNG from gas brought from local gathering lines and ship it out by rail and/or truck.&nbsp;One way to understand the impact that fracked gas is having on a region is to look at Act 13 payments.&nbsp;Also known as impact fees, Act 13 payments are distributed in part to communities affected by fracked gas.&nbsp;Act 13 payment reports show that this LNG project&nbsp;is situated among counties where there was high gas production in 2018 and 2019. It is also located near Norfolk Southern rail lines along the Susquehanna River.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you have been reading, there is an abundance of natural gas, the price is low, so how would gas producers and related industries make money? By exporting it!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>LNG is the export form of natural gas.&nbsp;By making a liquid out of a gas, the gas can be transported in containers. This is the form in which gas is moved around the globe.&nbsp;The New Fortress Energy scheme plans to move the LNG by tanker truck or rail from Wyalusing Township&nbsp;to a planned export port in Gibbstown, NJ, for export to foreign markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The current federal administration is promoting LNG exports, and a presidential executive order directed various federal agencies to expedite LNG export.&nbsp;Promoters of LNG exportation talk about &ldquo;energy independence.&rdquo;&nbsp;The irony is that LNG exporting, by creating more international demand, can actually drive up the price of gas for U.S. consumers and manufacturers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>But exporters can make money for their investors by locking in contracts overseas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Marcellus region is being colonized for resource extraction, and Pennsylvanians are exporting greenhouse gasses that exacerbate climate change.&nbsp; A &ldquo;resource curse,&rdquo; occurs where an economy becomes dependent on one industry.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not go there. Instead, let&rsquo;s control what happens to our communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Wyalusing plant, according to our calculation of figures New Fortress Energy told Wyalusing Township, will fill 350 tanker trucks per day, or 15 tanker trucks per hour, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.&nbsp;That is a harmful amount of traffic through Pennsylvania communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The LNG may move by rail. In December of 2019, a subsidiary of New Fortress Energy, called Energy Transport Solutions, received a special permit to transport LNG in&nbsp;rail cars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether by tanker truck or rail, the overland transport of this LNG will affect numerous counties and two states by the movement of highly flammable material.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But DEP permits did not look at the environmental harms caused by gas transport.&nbsp;One of the things in the recent Attorney General report that resonates with us is harms caused by truck traffic.&nbsp;DEP permitting does not look at truck traffic related to gas processing facilities or conduct area-wide assessments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another lasting impact the Bradford County LNG plant would have is the decades-long continuation of fracking that would have to occur to provide that gas feedstock.&nbsp;Fracking isn&rsquo;t just putting a pipe in the ground. The well pad needs to be constructed. Water needs be drawn from area rivers and streams.&nbsp;Sand needs to be brought in. Fracking waste needs to be taken to a disposal site; new disposal sites may be needed.&nbsp;Then, gas needs to be moved through gathering lines and pipelines to the LNG plant. A compressor station might be needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>How did this project get permitted?&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, that&rsquo;s easy. Fracking is a legal activity and there is a lot of gas here, with people angling to profit from its extraction and sale.&nbsp;We have a fragmented system of local government, where zoning is done at the municipality level. (Some counties have more county-wide planning than others.)&nbsp; For the Bradford County LNG plant, all it took was for township supervisors to approve conditional use zoning changes.&nbsp;Under the PA municipalities planning code, there is no requirement that one township consult with other municipalities to do this. And forget about consulting with other counties!</p>

<p>The other problem is that very few people are required to be informed about a project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Something called an Act 14 notice needs to be filed with the municipality where there will be earthmoving. It is for compliance with the NPDES permit &ndash; National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. DEP requires only that the Act 14 notice go to the &ldquo;host&rdquo; municipality and the county.&nbsp;Most counties simply file these notices because&nbsp;they have no mandate to advertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The New Fortress Energy plant received only two permits: for Air Quality and Site Disturbance. All other activities with the impacts that are ancillary to the LNG plant will be permitted separately to different companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unless your local press is on top of things, the only way to find out what projects are being proposed in your area, is to sign up for DEP&rsquo;s eNOTICES or read the weekly PA Bulletin.&nbsp; Even then, you will not see the relationships of the various parts of the project: such as pipelines, compressor stations, well pads, waste disposal sites, water withdraws, and sand importation.&nbsp;When you go to the DEP eFACTS website, there is no way to connect the dots to one industrial project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Projects are not only segmented at DEP, they are also segmented among other state agencies. For example, DEP does not coordinate with PennDOT. (Regardless, PennDOT cannot restrict anticipated volumes of traffic or trucks by type.). Pennsylvania has no agency coordinating siting of pipelines. It is all worked out between the pipeline company landmen and landowners. The Susquehanna River Basin Commission approves withdrawals of water for fracking and industrial use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the Protect Northern PA website there is information about how you can delve into publicly available sources of information.&nbsp;This lack of area-wide information and input is a major problem that Protect Northern PA wants to address.&nbsp;Public engagement is much needed, especially now that our legislature, wrongly, passed legislation to give tax incentives to petrochemical facilities to use northeastern PA&rsquo;s &ldquo;dry&rdquo; natural gas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protect Northern PA doesn&rsquo;t have all the answers, but we encourage the public to engage with us on how communities can build their defenses.&nbsp;Our website launched last month. <a href=""https://protectnorthernpa.org/"">Please check it out.</a>&nbsp;There is a place for individuals to sign up in order to stay in the loop or volunteer with our effort.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Protect Northern PA is an alliance of community members, environmental groups, civic organizations, and local businesses formed to critically examine potential air, water, public health, safety, and climate threats from the natural gas industry in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania. We share a concern that a gas-related industrial buildout will negatively and irreversibly change the environment and character of the region.</em></p>

Pennsylvania's Unions Must Look to the Future,9/2/2020,"<p>My maternal and paternal grandfathers were immigrants from Italy.&nbsp;Both worked in coal breakers in the anthracite region of northeast Pennsylvania, cracking and cleaning the raw coal that fueled America and the world.&nbsp;As members of the United Mineworkers of America (UMW), they faithfully paid their dues, and revered John L Lewis.</p>

<p>Both would have been appalled by what we&rsquo;re&nbsp;seeing today&mdash;Pennsylvania&rsquo;s unions willing to give up their hard-fought rights to a healthy workplace and healthy community for jobs.</p>

<p>My understanding of the diverse forces and players that make up the labor movement is gleaned from family stories told by grandfathers and uncles that were involved in the UMW. One told stories of being exploited by mine owners, but also by the unions themselves, especially around election day. Perhaps his illiteracy made him an easy target. Their history mimics the imperfect state history of labor unions, but even my&nbsp;family&rsquo;s fraught experience couldn&rsquo;t prepare me for the dualities of&nbsp;today&rsquo;s labor movement.</p>

<p>Last week, for the first time in its 14-year history, the Blue Green Alliance&mdash;a collaboration among national environmental and labor interests&mdash;<a href=""https://www.bluegreenalliance.org/the-latest/in-first-ever-presidential-endorsement-bluegreen-alliance-announces-support-for-joe-biden-for-president-and-kamala-harris-for-vice-president/"">endorsed Joe Biden</a> and Kamala Harris for President and Vice President.&nbsp;The alliance cited the campaign&rsquo;s plan to address climate change and create good-paying green jobs to rebuild the economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Independent of this joint endorsement, national unions made the same endorsement, including the United Steelworkers of America, United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters, International Union of Bricklayers, and the Utility Workers Union of America.</p>

<p>This union worldview is in stark comparison to what happened a month earlier in our state. The Pennsylvania Building Trades and AFL-CIO unions mounted an intense lobbying effort to win more than $670 million in subsidies to build four facilities that will turn fracked gas into fertilizers and other chemicals. The workers that will construct these facilities are guaranteed union-scale wages through a historic prevailing wage provision in the bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the effort is also supporting the expansion of hardcore chemical manufacturing into more rural parts of Pennsylvania that, to date, have enjoyed relatively toxic-free jobs until fracked gas drilling, pipelines&mdash;and now&mdash;chemical manufacturing was pushed into their backyards. Like the other petrochemical hubs in the United States, these facilities will soak communities and workers in toxics and exacerbate our climate system.</p>

<p>These actions by organized labor&mdash;a few weeks apart&mdash;are not only in competition with each other, but unsustainably opposed.</p>

<p>Despite decades of bitterly fought battles to win workers&rsquo; rights, elements of labor have lost some of its origin story and true north&mdash;that our workforce deserves and can have good paying jobs that don&rsquo;t destroy one&rsquo;s health or pollute their communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the flip side, other elements of labor embrace the opportunity to be part of building a 21st Century economy&mdash;one that is sustainable, equitable, and inclusive. PennFuture is proud to be part of an emerging collaboration to charter a new economic development future&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ReImagineAppalachia/posts/153365683049872"">called Reimagine Appalachia.</a> Their platform is bringing together worker rights, environmental, and justice concerns in ways I have not previously experienced in my decades of environmental work. This approach is having good results with a broad base of endorsements in hand. And we hope one day soon to have organized labor at the table to help shape this platform.</p>

<p>The sentiments expressed <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/commentary/we-shouldnt-have-to-choose-between-a-clean-environment-and-more-jobs-we-can-have-both-opinion/"">in a recent editorial by the principals of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO</a> does little to build bridges or strengthen any semblance of a possible blue green collaboration in this state. Actions speak louder than words and there was nothing inclusive about the &ldquo;bipartisan&rdquo; deal that these actors helped cut behind closed doors to expand petrochemical manufacturing, which the writers conveniently lump into their editorial&rsquo;s&nbsp;energy argument.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The viewpoints therein show a disconnect from the reality of climate change and what truly competitive workforces right now are focusing&nbsp;on: it is not fossil fuels, or an all of the above energy portfolio This is a body that is unprepared to make the really hard choices, but is choosing a climate-sane future really that hard to make?&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can have family-sustaining jobs and a good environment. They&rsquo;re not mutually exclusive. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s unions need to look to the future and not just its dirty past. As it stands now, many&nbsp;stand&nbsp;in direct opposition to what PennFuture and so many of our partners and allies embrace as the needed solutions to meet the climate crisis in a timely way, as guided by science: a break from fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The solutions must include devising an economy in Pennsylvania where labor leaders of the future will pursue work opportunities in sustainable sectors that are actually good for&nbsp;the environment.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Pennsylvania Continues to Miss Chesapeake Bay Commitments,8/26/2020,"<p>Despite recent planning efforts by the state and a renewed vigor in Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts, Pennsylvania continues to lag behind in its progress reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-07/documents/pa_2018_2019_2020_2021_final_milestone_evaluation.pdf"">released an evaluation of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s efforts</a> to reduce nitrogen, phosphorous and sediment pollution into the Chesapeake Bay Watershed by 2025. The evaluation found that, once again, Pennsylvania failed to meet its targets for the reporting period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The evaluation calls out several of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s major shortcomings, including a plan that falls short of nitrogen-reduction milestones by a whopping 9.8 million tons. In addition, 70 percent of developed land across the state continues to be located outside the jurisdiction of municipal stormwater programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that Pennsylvania has a long way to go.</p>

<p>One of the biggest hurdles in cleaning up our local waterways is the lack of a comprehensive funding strategy. <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/ChesapeakeBayOffice/WIPIII/FinalPlan/PA_Phase_3_WIP_Final.pdf"">Pennsylvania&rsquo;s cleanup plan identified</a> that the state has an annual funding gap of nearly $325 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunately not a surprise that Pennsylvania is failing to meet our Chesapeake Bay obligations. The General Assembly continues to attack environmental regulations and funding while failing to provide an adequate funding strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Pennsylvania has successfully reduced pollution from wastewater treatment plants within the Susquehanna and Potomac watersheds, nitrogen from agricultural runoff continues to account for more than 90 percent of the Bay&rsquo;s 9.8 million ton &ldquo;nitrogen gap.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due in large part to this high concentration of nitrogen pollution, the Bay&rsquo;s overall ecosystem health scored a C- <a href=""https://ecoreportcard.org/report-cards/chesapeake-bay/bay-health/"">in an annual assessment issued in May</a> by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than half of Pennsylvania flows into the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers empty directly into the Bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Poor water quality is not a problem uniquely found in the Bay. Upstream, one third of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s streams and rivers suffer from impaired water quality. <a href=""https://www.depgis.state.pa.us/2020_Integrated_Report/"">A draft report on the state&rsquo;s compliance</a> with the federal Clean Water Act finds that the number of impaired stream miles has grown by more than 5,500 miles over the past two years.</p>

<p>We need a new direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To lead the way, PennFuture will soon issue a detailed roadmap that outlines policy solutions and funding proposals to help Pennsylvania meet its pollution reduction goals. Our plan offers real and concrete solutions to bridge this funding gap, and offers practical solutions for state policymakers to put Pennsylvania back on track toward meeting our clean water goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Pennsylvania, without adequate funding,&nbsp;the path toward improving water quality in the Chesapeake Bay watershed remains murky, but we are hopeful that our roadmap will illuminate the best way forward. Be sure to stay tuned in the coming weeks when we unveil this new plan for clean water!</p>

Exploring Pennsylvania: Visiting All 121 State Parks in 303 Days,8/25/2020,"<p>Trevor Nordquist thinks every part of Pennsylvania offers something special and beautiful, and he should know: the 27-year-old just visited each of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 121 state parks in a span of 303 days!&nbsp;</p>

<p>From kayaking in <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/CodorusStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Codorus State Park</a> in southwestern York County and <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/BaldEagleStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Bald Eagle State Park</a> in Centre County, to biking in <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/MoraineStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Moraine State Park</a> in Butler County, to hiking in just about every park that offered trails, Nordquist has seen more of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s beauty in the last year than most of us experience in entire lifetimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Nordquist, a graduate student at Slippery Rock University in Butler County, first had to leave Pennsylvania to appreciate its beauty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Growing up in Pennsylvania, especially when I graduated high school, I wanted out of here,&rdquo; Nordquist recently told PennFuture. &ldquo;I never had an appreciation for this state like I should have.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nordquist&rsquo;s journey took him to Colorado as part of the AmeriCorps program, and it was there that he became &ldquo;obsessed with the outdoors.&rdquo; Given ten weeks to explore the state after his service ended, the Pennsylvania native set a goal to hike a &ldquo;Fourteener,&rdquo; or one of the 53&nbsp;mountain peaks in Colorado that exceed 14,000 feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After spending the summer of 2019 immersed in training and planning, Nordquist accomplished his goal by climbing Grays Peak in the Rocky Mountains right before coming home to Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The experience, he said, opened his eyes to the natural beauty in Pennsylvania he previously ignored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I returned, I realized that I never gave Pennsylvania any credit for also being beautiful, maybe even more beautiful than a majority of the country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I thought I should explore our state parks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what he did.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting on October 15, 2019 at <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/OilCreekStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Oil Creek State Park</a> in Venango County, Nordquist covered&nbsp;about 15,000 miles over the next year to see everything Pennsylvania has to offer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I loved every single park that I visited and I&rsquo;m going to start revisiting some beginning this weekend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought each park offered something special. The trails are very well maintained and clearly marked. I think Pennsylvania sets a great example for what a state parks system should look like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Specifically, Nordquist said he was &ldquo;blown away by the beauty&quot; of <a href=""https://pawilds.com/"">the Pennsylvania Wilds</a> area&nbsp;that includes <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/allegheny"">the Allegheny National Forest</a> and <a href=""https://visitpottertioga.com/explore/attractions/pennsylvania-grand-canyon/"">the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon</a>, among others, as well as the &ldquo;colonial feel&rdquo; of southern Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His favorite park was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Springs_State_Park"">Salt Springs State Park</a> in far northeastern Pennsylvania, a park that is home to hemlock trees that are over 500 years old and are among the largest trees in all of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calling it &ldquo;quant with numerous waterfalls and meadows full of wildflowers,&rdquo; Nordquist said it was the highlight of his trip. Not so much for <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/MarshCreekStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Marsh Creek State Park</a> in Chester County, he said, because it was jam-packed with visitors and didn&rsquo;t allow for much in the way of exploration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regardless, &ldquo;every part of this state offers us something special, and I hadn&rsquo;t realized that before,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, his journey took a very unexpected turn when the COVID-19 pandemic began unfolding in March. Lockdown orders sent residents outdoors and into state parks in unprecedented numbers, which isn&rsquo;t a bad thing on its face. But then came the enormous amounts of litter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw way too much trash,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Once COVID hit, everyone started to do more outside activities which is great, but they were not mindful of the environment. I started taking a bag with me and picked up after people. I think people think that there are people hired to clean up after them, so they aren&rsquo;t as mindful of their trash, but I really urge people to start cleaning up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another area of concern for Nordquist came when he was reflecting on his journey. Only once during the entire ordeal did he have to worry about driving in snow, which is typically a frequent occurrence during Pennsylvania winters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not common that we only experience one minor snowfall in any given year, and it really opened my eyes to the threat our world faces regarding climate change,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Climate change is a real threat.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nordquist finished his impressive feat in mid-August with a visit to <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/SusquehannockStatePark/Pages/default.aspx"">Susquehannock State Park</a> in Lancaster County. Now back home and able to reflect more intently on his journey, Nordquist said he hopes his experience inspires other Pennsylvanians to appreciate their homeland, but also to respect it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope native Pennsylvanians appreciate where they come from,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Pennsylvania is a great state. But I hope it also brings more awareness to being respectful to nature. I think we need to clean up after one another more. I would love to reach out to my local representatives and have an open discussion with them regarding the topic of environmental protection and my experience and how we can better the state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At PennFuture, we chose to tell Trevor&rsquo;s story for two reasons: it&rsquo;s an impressive story that highlights all of the beauty Pennsylvania has to offer, but it&rsquo;s also a cautionary tale about funding for our abundant state parks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now more than ever, it&rsquo;s crucial that our lawmakers maintain funding to these vital resources, especially because Pennsylvanians are flocking to our state parks in record numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, a contingent of lawmakers in Harrisburg have previously tried cutting funding for our parks, a move we could see again as the General Assembly works to bridge a significant budget deficit made even worse by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, a new bill has been introduced in Harrisburg<span style=""font-family:"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span><a href=""http://www.paenvironmentdigest.com/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=50782&amp;SubjectID="">House Bill 2806</a><span style=""font-family:"">&mdash;<o:p></o:p></span>that would remove the current ban on charging admission and parking fees at our state parks. PennFuture opposes this bill, and any bill that could restrict access to our parks and natural resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rest assured, PennFuture will be pushing back against this bill, as well as any attempts to gut funding for our parks and natural resources once budget discussions begin in the fall.&nbsp;</p>

REFUTED: CNX’s Eight Irrefutable Energy Truths Expose Industry Desperation,8/11/2020,"<p>Recently, CNX published a blog post called <a href=""https://www.cnx.com/newsroom/cnx-tra/news-post?ID=5"">&ldquo;Nine Irrefutable Energy Truths and a Critical Call to Action.&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;Reading the post then&mdash;which I highly suggest you do&mdash;my first reaction was to laugh. Was this a gag? It was so obviously absurd, it was hard to take it seriously at first. But, as I compose my response to the version <a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2020/08/eight-irrefutable-energy-truths-opinion.html"">adapted for Pennlive&rsquo;s Opinion section</a> just last week, the post no longer feels so funny.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As outlandish as it is, Nick DeIuliis&rsquo; opinion piece is a tiny part of a larger, highly sophisticated disinformation campaign that has infiltrated Pennsylvania&rsquo;s everyday reality. While DeIuliis seems to be grasping at straws, the not so funny truth is that these flaccid arguments are starting to gain traction with a public increasingly mistrustful of science. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re debunking these eight irrefutable energy &ldquo;truths&rdquo; with some truths of our own. The main difference: Our truths reflect reality.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #1: The Natural Gas Industry is Floundering</strong></u></p>

<p>As logic would tell you, price stress, oversupply, industry bankruptcy, and cancelled pipelines are indeed a sign of failure, despite CNX&rsquo;s bold claims otherwise. To make this claim, author and CNX Director and Chief Executive Officer Nick DeIuliis tells his readers that the good times are coming, comparing the rough start of the fracked gas industry to the early struggles of the information technology sector. Yet as the oil and gas sector flounders, information technology has continued to be the S&amp;P&rsquo;s best performing sector in the last decade. It shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that <a href=""https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500-energy-sector/#overview"">S&amp;P Energy</a>&mdash;made up of exclusively oil and gas companies&mdash;<a href=""https://ieefa.org/ieefa-update-oil-and-gas-stocks-place-dead-last-in-2019-again-despite-30-price-rise/"">comes dead last.</a></p>

<p>This is what failure looks like.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #2: The Era of Fossil Fuel Dominance is Ending</strong></u></p>

<p>Our society has run on fossil fuels for centuries, shifting from one technology to the next as we innovate and discover new pathways forward: From coal to oil and gas. Yet while fossil fuels have brought us a long way, their exploitation has come at a cost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fracked gas is no exception. <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/climate-risks-natural-gas?utm_campaign=tw&amp;utm_medium=tw&amp;utm_source=tw#:~:text=An%20estimated%20one%20to%20nine,replacing%20coal%20with%20natural%20gas."">Projected global warming emissions</a> from natural gas are on par with an energy mix dominated by coal, especially when we consider factors like methane leaks (a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide), increased energy demand over time, and the slow decline of carbon-neutral nuclear power. Worse still, fracked gas and associated petrochemical facilities threaten public health with <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2020/08/02/A-decade-of-water-woes-in-Butler-County/stories/202007310107"">contaminated water</a>, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/climate/gas-flares-premature-babies.html?surface=home-discovery-vi-prg&amp;fellback=false&amp;req_id=749127125&amp;algo=identity&amp;imp_id=983713178&amp;action=click&amp;module=Science%20%20Technology&amp;pgtype=Homepage"">premature births</a>, and <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-string-of-rare-cancer-cases-pennsylvania-investigates-potential-link-to-fracking-11576837802"">unexplained cancers</a>. Communities of color and low-income communities are especially impacted.</p>

<p>Luckily, we now have the technology to continue the progress of centuries prior while improving outcomes for public health, the environment, and justice. As we have done in the past, we will continue to innovate and move forward, to embrace life- and earth-preserving energy conservation and generation like solar and wind. Renewable energy is <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Coal-Outlook-2020_March-2020.pdf"">already forecasted to surpass coal</a> in electricity generation by this year&rsquo;s end and will continue its path forward over the coming decades.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #3: Renewables are Winning</strong></u></p>

<p>One challenge for the renewable energy transition is that our existing policies and infrastructure are built to serve the energy systems of the past. This legacy&mdash;of fossil fuel subsidies, of preference for large-scale over community energy generation, and of fossil fuel influence in politics&mdash;slows down the transition to renewables, but it cannot stop it. <a href=""https://www.c2es.org/content/renewable-energy/#:~:text=Renewable%20energy%20is%20the%20fastest,wind%20power%20(6.6%20percent)."">Renewable energy is growing faster</a> than any other energy source in the U.S. Part of the reason is that it&#39;s cheap: Just check out the Forbes article titled <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/06/15/renewable-energy-is-now-the-cheapest-option-even-without-subsidies/#1486c0475a6b"">&ldquo;Renewable Energy Is Now The Cheapest Option - Even Without Subsidies.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Despite this spectacular growth in the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition in the U.S., however, supportive policy is still needed. The necessity to shift to renewable energy is more than economical&mdash;it is a moral obligation. The subsidies propping up the flailing fossil fuel industry must be eliminated and replaced with subsidies that help us address the climate crisis, improve public health, and support home-grown jobs.</p>

<p>And, if you&rsquo;re curious about the greenhouse gas emissions of renewable energy from mining all the way to operation, <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/conference/2015/pdf/presentations/skone.pdf"">be sure to read this</a>.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a preview: Despite Nick DeIuliis&rsquo; claim, many honest analyses have been performed, and renewables outperform natural gas every time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #4: A Zero-Carbon Future is Coming</strong></u></p>

<p>According to an article from the Financial Times, <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/conference/2015/pdf/presentations/skone.pdf"">&ldquo;a&nbsp;zero-carbon future is both feasible and affordable.&rdquo;</a> While this may be difficult to imagine&mdash;even the production of renewable energy sources emit greenhouse gases from mining and transportation of materials&mdash;this future relies heavily on &ldquo;boosting the role of electricity.&rdquo; In this not so faraway future, mining equipment and vehicles for transportation will run on electricity powered by renewable energy.</p>

<p>One reason that CNX might want to sow doubt about this prospect is that <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2019/11/04/how-to-reach-us-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-decarbonizing-industry/#28baf9f27cb4"">reducing industry emissions</a>&mdash;67 percent of which come from natural gas, petroleum, chemicals, and plastics industries&mdash;will be absolutely critical. When Nick DeIuliis says that &ldquo;outrage should be directed at academia,&rdquo; what he really means is that undermining science is one of the few options fossil fuel industries have left.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #5: Petrochemicals are the Final Frontier for Fossil Fuel Survival</strong></u></p>

<p>The oil and gas industry is trying to leverage the pandemic to reaffirm its role in a world eager to move on, claiming over and over that &ldquo;plastic saves lives&rdquo;&mdash;from surgical gloves and face masks to ventilators. But what the industry isn&rsquo;t telling you is that 59 percent of polyethylene (the type of plastic that the Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County would produce) is actually used to create packaging like food and beverage containers. As prices for oil and gas plummet and alternatives like solar and wind become more competitive, fossil fuel executives are staking their bet on petrochemicals. But as the attractiveness of this industry grows, more companies are jumping on the bandwagon and creating a massive plastics oversupply. Their success, then, relies on you thinking that plastics&mdash;and a whole lot more of them&mdash;are essential.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #6: Commitment to Fossil Fuels Threatens Our Geopolitical Power</strong></u></p>

<p>Fossil fuels like natural gas exacerbate climate change and threaten environmental health domestically&mdash;but the impacts don&rsquo;t stop there. Our undying commitment to fossil fuels is embarrassing us on an international scale. When the United States decided to leave the Paris Climate Agreement, we not only relinquished our role as a global leader on climate change, but we undermined our reputation broadly.</p>

<p>If you need further evidence, look no further than the situation in which we currently find ourselves. Science denialism&mdash;which fuels our failed response to the climate crisis&mdash;is now hampering our response to another issue of international importance: coronavirus. Unless we start taking science seriously and responding to these crises with the urgency they demand, our reputation as a global leader will continue to falter.</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #7: A Diversified Economy Sustains the Middle Class</strong></u></p>

<p>Extractive industries have left Pennsylvanian&rsquo;s stranded without jobs time and time again. They set up monopolistic economies reliant upon their success. When profits dry up, companies abandon ship, leaving communities to clean up the health, environmental, and economic mess left in their wake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is no way to structure an economy. We need the long-term, life-sustaining jobs of the future, not the dirty jobs of our past. Increasingly, these jobs can be found in industries like energy efficiency, renewable energy, and nature-based small businesses. In fact, despite the fracked gas boom of the past decade, clean energy jobs actually employ twice as many people as the fossil fuel industry in Pennsylvania. The majority of these jobs are in construction and manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Irrefutable Truth #8: We Need Your Voice to Combat Industry Mistruths</strong></u></p>

<p>Nick DeIuliis&rsquo; mistruths reek of an industry desperate to stay afloat. It is clear that fossil fuel interests will stop at nothing to ensure their legacy of extracting profits continues for as long as possible, despite the consequences for public health, global warming, and environmental protection. Much of that fight is political. It takes place in our newspapers, our schools, and our capitol.</p>

<p>Just weeks ago, legislators passed a bill which provides $667 million dollars of tax breaks to the petrochemical and fertilizer industries over the next 25 years. Other legislation being considered includes enabling community solar, changing the definition of recycling to include harmful plastic incineration, and establishing more public health safeguards from fracked gas. These decisions will impact the immediate future, and their ramifications will be felt for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let industry mistruths dominate the conversation&mdash;talk to you legislator today.</p>

<p>Regardless, as fracked gas companies flounder in the past, we will continue to innovate and move forward, to embrace life and earth-preserving energy conservation and generation like solar and wind. Our very future depends on it.&nbsp;</p>

Senate Bill 15: A New Direction for Pennsylvania,7/30/2020,"<p>The energy industry across the nation is in transition, a fact that is particularly obvious in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; People once talked of &ldquo;king coal,&rdquo; but those days are long gone as new technologies make conventional steam coal plants&mdash;once the mainstay of &ldquo;baseload&rdquo; power&mdash;obsolete and far too expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Politicians like President Donald Trump claim that slashing protections for public health and the environment will bring coal back, but those are nothing but empty campaign promises. Despite an unprecedented number of environmental rollbacks and despite millions of taxpayer dollars wasted on his <a href=""https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-to-be-long-on-electricity-coal-closures-may-accelerate-8211-doe-official-58511969"">&ldquo;coalFirst&rdquo; initiative</a>, coal generation in Pennsylvania is one third what it was the day the President took office.</p>

<p>Ohio tried a different approach with HB6, a bill which charges ratepayers an extra $50 million per year to subsidize coal generation, guts standards for clean renewable generation, and subsidizes nuclear power. Despite praise from the fossil fuel industry at a recent committee hearing hosted by Pennsylvania state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, Ohio&rsquo;s plan is proving to be a spectacular failure. On the very day Rep. Metcalf and his guests were lauding Ohio&rsquo;s approach, Ohio&rsquo;s Speaker of the House was arrested by the FBI on racketeering and bribery charges related to the passage of HB6 and a move to repeal the subsidy program is gaining steam.</p>

<p>Far from coal making a comeback, the few remaining large coal plants in Pennsylvania are all near retirement. No one is investing money in new plants to replace them and many of the traditional coal operators <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063430425"">are fleeing the business</a>. It&rsquo;s long past the time that politicians face the facts. Rather than telling lies and making empty promises, they should focus on serious policies to assist the workers and communities that will be impacted when these plants inevitably close.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, our state leadership now faces an additional challenge in helping the state recover from the COVID-19 crisis. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Green-Stimulus-FINAL.pdf"">As PennFuture recently detailed in a report on the topic</a>, that needs to be a green recovery that does more than just fund traditional polluting sources and hoping benefits trickle down.</p>

<p><u><strong>There is a real plan to move Pennsylvania Forward</strong></u></p>

<p>Senator Costa and a number of co-sponsors have just introduced &ldquo;The Energy Transition and Recovery Act&rdquo; (SB15) that, if passed, would help guide the Commonwealth through the coming energy transition and support our workers and communities as we cut carbon emissions and other harmful pollution.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 15 recognizes that while Governor Wolf has the authority to create a RGGI program on his own though the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the legislature could work with the Governor to make that program more flexible and make a difference for workers and communities.</p>

<p>RGGI is a market-based program that works by creating a cap on carbon pollution from the electric generation industry. Each ton of allowable emissions under that cap is represented by a single allowance. Facilities can take action to lower their emissions, but if they are going to pollute they need to purchase sufficient allowances at auction. The price of those allowances is set by the market and the proceeds come back to Pennsylvania to be invested in various ways.</p>

<p>DEP is currently developing a RGGI program using the authority granted by the Air Pollution Control Act. Once that program becomes operational, the proceeds from the auction will be deposited into the Clean Air Fund and can be used to support the program itself or be invested in ways that reduce air pollution. That alone can do a lot of good, generating over $2 billion over the first decade of the program, but with the assistance of the Legislature the program could be much more flexible in how the proceeds are used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Particularly, it is important to provide support to workers and communities that will be impacted by the transition away from coal which is already happening regardless of RGGI.&nbsp; The right thing to do is help communities move away from a reliance on the dying coal industry and toward more prosperous economic activities, including&nbsp; modernizing their skill sets to be compatible with our 21st century economy and incentivizing new industries with long-term growth potential.</p>

<p>The DEP would implement the RGGI program in the same way, but investments of the net proceeds under SB15 would be guided by an energy transition plan. A quarter of the proceeds would still go to the Clean Air Fund, but the remainder would go into a newly created Energy Transition Fund and used for certain types of projects in key categories:</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 40px;"">35% &ndash; Programs to support workers and communities<br />
15% &ndash; Bill assistance for low-income customers<br />
20% &ndash; Weatherization assistance programs<br />
30% &ndash; Solar generation, energy efficiency, and energy demand reduction</p>

<p>While the legislation specifies the categories for funding and the broad goals of the program, the details of what projects are funded and where community support would be prioritized would be guided by an Energy Transition Plan. This plan will be developed by the state agencies involved in transition planning after an extensive public participation process that includes hearings in impacted communities and fossil fuel producing regions of the commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plan must also be approved by a board consisting of agency members, legislative appointees, and representatives of environmental justice areas, labor groups, clean energy companies, energy consuming industries, and others.</p>

<p><u><strong>With this bill, Pennsylvania will be an innovator</strong></u></p>

<p>All the existing RGGI states make investments in energy efficiency, and most also invest in renewable energy and energy bill assistance as well. That has proven to be a success.&nbsp; A recent independent report found that in the first 10 years of the program those investments returned over $5.4 billion in net benefits resulting from $3.2 billion in revenue generated by the RGGI program, producing 1.78 times the benefits compared to the monies invested.</p>

<p>While many of the programs deployed by RGGI states contain implicit job-creation benefits, especially in the areas of renewable energy development and weatherization, the SB15 plan builds on this foundation but goes even further by investing in education, outreach, and job training. Other RGGI states spend an average of just 2 percent on those areas, where this bill would devote 26.25 percent of total proceeds to these efforts. This bill also requires that, in making those investment decisions, the state seek meaningful input and consultation from environmental justice communities as well as labor groups.</p>

<p>This recognition that environmental justice is a key issue for any successful plan is part of a growing trend across states. New Jersey, Maryland, and New York have already taken steps in that direction, but Pennsylvania has the opportunity to show real leadership.</p>

<p>The conventional wisdom may be that the politics of the Pennsylvania Legislature and opposition from fossil-fuel interests will keep SB15 from getting any traction. If so, that will be a big loss for our workers and communities. We have an opportunity to innovate and grow a sustainable economy that will not only help our current recovery, it will keep Pennsylvania an energy leader in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

"PennFuture's ""Democracy for All"" Program At Work in Pennsylvania",7/30/2020,"<p>It is a fact that communities of color are disproportionately impacted by climate change and pollution, and that is not accidental.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Historically, the burden of polluting factories and industries has been placed directly on low-income communities and communities of color, which in turn exacerbates the impacts of climate change on these communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These communities not only shoulder outsized burdens from pollution and climate change, but they are often overlooked and underrepresented in all levels of our government and democracy. We steadfastly believe that the key to helping these communities fight for environmental justice is to maximize their power in our democracy.</p>

<p>Too often, environmental organizations just move pollution from one person&#39;s backyard to another&rsquo;s. To win this fight, we need to keep the chemicals and pollutants that cause asthma, cancer, and climate change out of Pennsylvania entirely, and we need to amplify the voices within our communities of color to accomplish that.</p>

<p>PennFuture has always focused on protecting our air, water, and land, and empowering all Pennsylvanians to build sustainable communities for future generations. Civic engagement can be the first step in that empowerment, which is why our Democracy For All&mdash;PennFuture program seeks to register many new voters in 2020, primarily in communities of color.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to the pandemic, we have had to get creative in how we engage and register new people of color. Not being out in the field has dampened the number of people we can physically register.&nbsp; Not to be deterred, we have gone digital! Our canvassers are all digitally focused on phone banking, texting, and relational texting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Area Directors, while managing the canvassers, will also be focusing on developing relationships with organizations. They will also be encouraging organizations and local events to utilize our tablets to register their members to register to vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our social media strategist will work to develop social media content for the newly formed civic engagement page, our Facebook and Instagram pages as well as creating online events. She will be working closely with PennFuture staff to make our reach as far as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My long term goal for Democracy for All is to be a program that continues to register new people to vote, educates people about the importance of voting, and empowers people to empower themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would like to introduce you to the Democracy for All team:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shavon Ferguson - Area Director for northeast Pennsylvania with a focus on Lackawanna, Schuylkill, Monroe, and Luzerne counties.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Josie Lopez - Area Director for southeast Pennsylvania with a focus on Northampton, Lehigh, Dauphin, and Berks counties.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Carrie Myers - Social Media Strategist with a focus on branding the Democracy for All - PennFuture name and engaging audiences on social media and other platforms.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Erlinda Aguiar - Quality Control/Quality Analyst will be making sure that we are compliant on all fronts and analyzing data to see how well we are digital engaging with targeted communities.&nbsp;</li>

A New Coalition for a Better Future,7/29/2020,"<p>As of July 23, 2020, it&rsquo;s official&mdash;Pennsylvania has a law that will award four lucky petrochemical or fertilizer manufacturing entities each $6.6 million a year in tax credits for 26 years to set up shop here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like the $1.65 billion subsidy the state handed Shell for its Beaver County cracker plant, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fracked gas industry will once again enjoy the largesse of Pennsylvania taxpayers. The fracked gas industry apparently needs $660 million of the public&rsquo;s help to optimize the use of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Marcellus shale gas into something beyond energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This handout will take its product into the climate-killing and health-risking realm of petrochemical, plastics and fertilizer manufacturing. Apparently the fracked gas industry can&rsquo;t succeed on the basis of significant private investments alone.</p>

<p>The legislation that made this all possible&mdash;<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-responds-to-passage-of-House-Bill-732"">HB 732</a>, which was originally crafted to help emergency responders and was amended to include the fracked gas industry tax credit&mdash;was a reworking of <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-Thirty-five-groups-rally-against-House-Bill-1100"">HB 1100</a>, which also provided a petrochemical subsidy, albeit an open-ended one. That legislation passed both chambers but the Governor vetoed it in March.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The petrochemical industry&rsquo;s friends in the state legislature never attempted to overturn that veto because the environmental community and our partners&mdash;with the help of many of you&mdash;mounted a textbook campaign to call attention to the corporate greed and cronyism that defined that bill. And when the Governor vetoed it, our coalition graciously said thank you, and never spiked the ball to celebrate the formidable victory that it was at the time.</p>

<p>In the end, the fight was among special interests in the state, and legislators chose to do the bidding of the building trade unions and the fracking industry, and not the bidding of mainstream interests that our diverse coalition of environmentalists, community, religious and other business leaders represented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This law picks winners&mdash;fracked gas, petrochemicals, fertilizers and plastics&mdash;and every other business and industry sector is by omission, a loser, and during a pandemic-induced recession where all sectors need help. As an example, what is the legislature and Governor doing to bolster agriculture and tourism, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s number one and number two industries, respectively?</p>

<p>The deal that became law was struck behind closed doors, by&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;probably mostly white men.&nbsp;I say &ldquo;probably&rdquo; because when environmental leaders like me were asked to be represented at the deal table, we were rejected. Possibly others asked to be part of the conversation and also denied.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can say with certainty that after the March 9, 2020 rally in the state capitol held by <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fighting-for-Our-Future"">the 35 groups represented in our HB 1100 coalition</a>, a counter rally was held.&nbsp;During that counter-rally, the proponents of taxpayer giveaways for the petrochemical industry reflected predominately white, male demographics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the most part, the legislators, industry, economic development and union faces that gathered this past Friday in northeast Pennsylvania to celebrate the Governor&rsquo;s signing of HB 732, media coverage revealed the same predominate demographics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And we should expect that the &ldquo;800&rdquo; temporary and &ldquo;150&rdquo; permanent jobs that each of the four subsidized petrochemical or fertilizer facilities is supposed to employ will also be mostly, and by a large margin, white and male.</p>

<p>Despite a textbook campaign against HB 1100, the interests of many, many Pennsylvanians who desire an economic break from fossil fuels were not represented at the HB 732 deal table. I am concerned that come 2022, when Pennsylvanians go to the polls to elect a new governor&mdash;possibly our last chance to seat a leader who is climate-aware and willing to lead all Pennsylvanians into a healthier, prosperous and climate-sane future&mdash;we&nbsp;may not be presented a diverse array of candidates.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>We fully appreciate that several early names of possible gubernatorial candidates may very well represent mainstream environmental interests, but no names of women or persons of color are in the rumor mill currently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>My points here and above should not be taken as anti-male, but we simply need more diversity in the legislature and higher offices in our state for things to change.&nbsp; Nor should this redux be taken as sour grapes over the significant loss this was for PennFuture&rsquo;s mission of clean air, water and a healthy climate. It is meant to be a cautionary reminder of how things still work in &ldquo;the People&rsquo;s House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For things to change, Pennsylvania needs a new coalition, and one powerful enough that legislators will forego the powerful payoff of campaign contributions that drive so much of this dysfunctional power dynamic.&nbsp;If we use Pennsylvania&rsquo;s primary election as a data point, we saw several races where powerful labor forces supported challengers to pro-environment incumbents&mdash;many women&mdash;and those challengers lost badly. The electorate is waking up to the dominant political paradigms here and fighting back, but many policymakers lag behind the wishes of Pennsylvanians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We must come together to forge a different economic road forward, with family sustaining jobs that protect and improve our environment. We must come together for a sane climate future. We must fight for a future state legislature where four-fifths of its members vote in favor of protecting our communities and the environment rather than in favor of a subsidy for an industry that will do exactly the opposite.&nbsp; We need a governor who is not reliant upon fracked gas and petrochemicals, and a legislature that is obligated to the electorate, not to powerful labor interests and greedy fossil fuel corporations who are wringing the entrepreneurial and competitive life out of the rest of us and our futures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s Democracy for All program is now fully engaged in non-partisan voter registration, voter engagement and get out the vote work.&nbsp; The people of color and their communities, single women and millennials this program is reaching out to may form the basis of this new coalition and help move Pennsylvania forward along a very different and green path.</p>

"PennFuture releases ""A Green Stimulus and Recovery Platform for Pennsylvania"" Report",7/28/2020,"<p>A rampant global health pandemic. A deep and rapid decline in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy that is nearly double that of the Great Recession of 2008. Rising racial inequality. Nearly 3 million Pennsylvanians seeking unemployment benefits since mid-March. Small businesses shuttered&mdash;some permanently&mdash;as Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy struggles to reopen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s abundantly clear that these are unprecedented times, and that our leaders in all levels of government will have to spend the next several years advancing economic and public health solutions that spur our economy towards recovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why PennFuture <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Green-Stimulus-FINAL.pdf"">released today a strategic roadmap</a> to guide our leaders to implement a green stimulus recovery plan for Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This 50-page report lays out specific policy recommendations that leverage Pennsylvania&rsquo;s growing nature-based, clean energy, and low-carbon industries to put people back to work and build a more resilient and sustainable economy.</p>

<p>The report has four overarching goals that guide each recommendation made within the document: safely restart Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy in a way that reduces pollution and is protective of human health, avoid state budget cuts that will harm our businesses and slow recovery, target short-term investments that provide family-sustaining wages, and advance long-term investments to support sustainable infrastructure and industries that contribute to resilient, clean and profitable communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All told, PennFuture&rsquo;s policy platform is estimated to amount to $2.8 billion in investments, which would preserve or create as many as 389,000 jobs in the Commonwealth, including nearly 37,200 shovel-ready jobs, while also reducing pollution, promoting our natural resources, and advancing public health.</p>

<p>There is evidence to back up the necessity of our green stimulus and recovery platform.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/publications/wpapers/workingpaper20-02.pdf"">a recent study from Oxford University</a> that analyzed 700 separate stimulus policies from the Great Recession, projects that focus dually on economic recovery and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions deliver higher returns on government spending both in the short and long term.</p>

<p>Our leaders also cannot turn to industry to jumpstart this recovery. Carbon dioxide emissions <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-green-stimulus-clean-energy-future/"">skyrocketed by 5.1 percent in 2009</a> when America&rsquo;s economy finally started to bounce back from the Great Recession. It is indisputable that Pennsylvania, similar to the rest of the world, is at a critical juncture where we must make concerted and dedicated efforts to drastically cut our carbon footprint immediately.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is at an inflection point. We either pursue old and tired methods of recovery that rely on slashing budgets and public sector jobs, or we chart a new direction that creates a new and sustainable economy while serving the dual purpose of addressing the climate crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The choice is ours, and the chance to emerge from this historic challenge as better, cleaner, more resilient Pennsylvania is at our fingertips. Here&rsquo;s to hoping our elected officials are listening.&nbsp;</p>

A New Voice in the Fight Against Petrochemicals,7/16/2020,"<p>As the petrochemical industry rears its ugly head in Pennsylvania, PennFuture is building organizational capacity to deliver a counter narrative focused on the environment, health, and economic future of our state. I am joining PennFuture in this stead under the title of Policy Analyst.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was first drawn into the fight against petrochemicals about three years ago while working in Pittsburgh at the Group Against Smog and Pollution (GASP) as a Communications and Education Specialist. I was doing outreach at an event in Pittsburgh, speaking to community members about Shell&rsquo;s petrochemical project in Beaver County&mdash;colloquially referred to as a &ldquo;cracker plant&rdquo;&mdash;when a community member recalled the sweet smell of cookies that once emanated from the Nabisco Plant in East Liberty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem so dangerous,&rdquo; he told me.</p>

<p>As I packed up my tabling materials later that day, his comment haunted me. How many other community members had misinterpreted the word &ldquo;cracker&rdquo;? Did they understand that Shell was hoping to cook up 1.6 million tons of plastic each year, not cookies? That the industry hoped to replicate Louisiana&rsquo;s toxic &ldquo;Cancer Alley&rdquo; right here in Pennsylvania? That each taxpayer had personally subsidized the buildout by an average of $397 worth of tax credits? What seemed like a small, innocent misunderstanding came to exemplify the true forces that we were up against: the industry&rsquo;s overwhelming presence in our political system, and their disquieting silence everywhere else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These worries continued to plague me during my time with Pennsylvania Resources Council, where I worked as a Zero Waste Specialist to reduce waste through recycling and composting programs. I watched mountains of trash form over the course of just a few hours as I informed yet another resident that, no, their Starbucks cup was not recyclable, nor was their plastic lid or plastic straw. I came to understand that, despite what the petrochemical industry would have you believe, this problem was bigger than any individual, and our well-intentioned attempts at recycling were not going to solve it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While my heart is in Pittsburgh and my eyes and ears are on Pennsylvania&rsquo;s petrochemical interests, I am currently writing to you from New Haven, Connecticut. I left Pittsburgh two years ago to attend the Yale School of the Environment. While here, I&rsquo;ve layered a deeper understanding of environmental justice on top of my growing expertise in communications, regional air quality issues, and policy analysis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Environmental justice lies at the core of my value system, and all of my work is filtered through that lens. I bring these concerns&mdash;those of distributional impacts on economy, environment and health; generational impacts on our youth, of which I consider myself included; and procedural impacts resulting from unjust power relations between industry and individuals&mdash;to my role as Policy Analyst.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I am joining a committed team of staff members&mdash;PennFuture&rsquo;s DEIJ (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice) Committee&mdash;to help further environmental justice within the organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a Master&rsquo;s of Environmental Management from the Yale School of Forestry and a Bachelor&rsquo;s of Science in Environmental Science from the University of Florida. I also have an almost 3-year old brother, a less adorable 30-year old brother, and a lovely cast of family and friends supporting me in both South Florida and Pittsburgh. I hope to relocate to Pittsburgh as soon as it is safe to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a strange time to be making big life changes and yet, here I am, in the middle of the pandemic, joining PennFuture in a fight that will determine Pennsylvania&rsquo;s future&mdash;as well as the stability of our global climate and the long-term efficacy of the fossil fuel industry&mdash;for generations to come. There is no place I would rather be. So, to the board, my fellow co-workers, and anyone who supports PennFuture&rsquo;s work and mission: I am so grateful to have joined the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Together, let&rsquo;s chart a path for Pennsylvania that includes a clean energy economy and a healthy environment, not petrochemicals, plastics and dirty energy.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Pipeline's Cancellation Shows Importance of Renewables in Pennsylvania,7/8/2020,"<p>In a major win for the environment, Dominion Energy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. announced Sunday that they will not be moving forward with their Atlantic Coast fracked gas pipeline. The <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/05/dominion-duke-cancel-atlantic-coast-pipeline-legal-uncertainty/5380949002/"">companies said increased costs and delays</a> as well as &ldquo;legal uncertainty&rdquo; made the project untenable. The pipeline&rsquo;s demise ends the threat it posed to the water, air, and soil of the communities through which it would have passed.</p>

<p>The pipeline was controversial from its inception in 2014. Environmentalists and local landowners opposed the 600-mile project, which would have crossed the Appalachian Trail and carried fracked gas from West Virginia to North Carolina. In its path was the predominantly African-American community of Union Hill, Virginia.</p>

<p>The Sierra Club, the Virginia State Conference of NAACP Branches, and the Kairos Center for Religions, Rights, and Social Justice, among others, joined a suit brought by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Friends of Buckingham to stop the pipeline&rsquo;s construction.</p>

<p>In January, a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously found that Virginia&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Quality <a href=""https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/pipeline-station.pdf"">had failed to adequately consider</a> the pipeline&rsquo;s potential effects on Union Hill citizens. The 4th Circuit also agreed that Virginia had failed to consider zero-emission turbines as an alternative to the pipeline developers&rsquo; use of gas-fired turbines in a compressor station.</p>

<p>For developers Duke and Dominion, that ruling was only the latest in a string of legal headaches: the pipeline&rsquo;s Endangered Species Act permit, right of way across the Blue Ridge Parkway, and water permit verifications <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060119601"">had all already been invalidated</a> by the 4th Circuit in 2018.</p>

<p>But last month, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-1584_igdj.pdf"">sided with the energy companies</a> and overturned another 4th Circuit decision that prevented the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from granting the pipeline a special use permit for a segment of pipeline that crossed the Appalachian National Scenic Trail on federal land.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the environment and the affected communities, the pipeline developers&rsquo; Supreme Court victory wasn&rsquo;t enough to justify moving forward on the project. The pipeline still lacked many other permits, and <a href=""https://www.southernenvironment.org/news-and-press/news-feed/atlantic-coast-pipeline-problems-persist-despite-supreme-court-decision"">evidence suggested that the project</a> would only add unnecessary fossil fuel capacity to the grid. Duke and Dominion <a href=""https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/dominion-energy-and-duke-energy-cancel-the-atlantic-coast-pipeline"">said in a statement</a> that ongoing &ldquo;litigation risk,&rdquo; including recent adverse rulings in other districts, made the project &ldquo;no longer a prudent use of shareholder capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like Virginia, Pennsylvania has witnessed rapid growth in its gas industry over the past decade because of fracking. The industry has long touted itself as both a jobs creator and an environmentally friendly alternative to coal-fired energy generation.</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s true that fracked gas has lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal, extraction through fracking <a href=""https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-other-important-greenhouse-gas"">also results in the leakage of methane</a>, a greenhouse gas with a <a href=""https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-other-important-greenhouse-gas"">heat-trapping potential 84 times higher</a> than that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. And recent research has concluded that methane emissions from oil and gas production have been underestimated <a href=""https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2020/02/19/Scientists-greatly-underestimating-methane-emitted-by-humans/6531582130062/"">by as much as 40 percent</a>. That means that fracked gas is little better than coal when it comes to slowing climate change and in fact, it may be worse.</p>

<p>In addition, fracking can <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/environmental-impacts-natural-gas#references"">result in the release of toxic and hazardous air pollutants</a> regulated by the EPA due to their ability to cause cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, and other health complications.</p>

<p>Finally, fracking can also <a href=""https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/issues/fracking/environmental-impacts-water/"">threaten local water resources</a>, especially in areas where water is already scarce. The toxic chemicals used in fracking fluid are stored in open pits that have been linked to animal deaths and negative health consequences in humans. And fracking liquid, flammable gas, or methane itself <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/article/federal-report-appears-to-undercut-epa-assurances-water-safety-pennsylvania"">often contaminates local water sources</a>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, in Pennsylvania, the Attorney General has been coming down hard not only on the industry but also the state Department of Environmental Protection for failing to operate safely (<a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/press-releases/ag-shapiro-pa-fracking-company-pleads-to-criminal-conviction-in-43rd-statewide-grand-jury-investigation/"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/press-releases/ag-shapiro-and-43rd-statewide-grand-jury-file-criminal-charges-against-nepa-fracking-company/"">here</a>) and for <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/press-releases/43rd-statewide-grand-jury-finds-pennsylvania-failed-to-protect-citizens-during-fracking-boom/"">failing to protect our communities</a> and our environment from the harmful impacts of fracking.</p>

Food &amp; Water Watch <a href=""https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/news/fracking-industrys-phony-jobs-numbers"">recently found that the American Petroleum Institute</a>, a leading oil and fracking trade group, &ldquo;promotes extremely misleading claims about the number of Americans working in the fracking industry&rdquo; in &ldquo;a clear attempt to defend the economically struggling industry that is linked to air, water, and climate pollution.&rdquo; API has claimed, for instance, that half a million jobs in Pennsylvania would be at risk if fracking were banned in the state. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, on the other hand, counts only 26,000 fracking jobs in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The industry has contracted significantly in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Even before the pandemic, North American fracking firms were in a precarious position: their <a href=""https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/CGEPReserveBaseLendingAndTheOutlookForShaleOilAndGasFinance.pdf"">net debt exploded</a> from $50 billion in 2005 to $200 billion in 2015. After the COVID-19 outbreak began, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/energy-environment/pennsylvania-shale-gas-fracking.html"">Chevron suggested it might sell </a>its Appalachian shale assets, the bulk of which are in Pennsylvania. And Chesapeake Energy<span id=""docs-internal-guid-91bed888-7fff-4e7b-ca45-a3c01629191f""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">&mdash;</span></span>once the second-largest fracked gas producer in the U.S. and a pioneer in the fracking boom<span id=""docs-internal-guid-91bed888-7fff-4e7b-ca45-a3c01629191f""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">&mdash;</span></span><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/28/business/chesapeake-energy-bankruptcy/index.html"">filed for bankruptcy last month</a>.</p>

<p>The better option for Pennsylvania is to invest in clean, renewable energy. Unlike fracked gas and other fossil fuels, solar and wind power are not subject to the same sorts of supply and production issues that lead to volatile market fluctuations. As a result, <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/benefits-renewable-energy-use"">renewable energy prices can remain stable</a> over time. This is good news for consumers, who can then depend upon predictable electricity costs.</p>

<p>In addition, jobs in solar and wind are growing, while jobs in the fossil fuel industry are not. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that over the next decade, <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm"">the two fastest-growing jobs</a> in the U.S. are solar photovoltaic installer and wind turbine service technician. As far back as 2016, the solar power industry alone employed <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/for-us-jobs-creation-renewables-are-a-better-bet-than-coal"">twice as many people</a> as the coal, oil, and gas industries combined did.</p>

<p>And finally, the pure economics of renewables make them the obvious choice for developing new generating capacity. Solar and wind energy generation <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/04/climate-change-coal-now-more-expensive-than-wind-solar-energy/1277637001/"">are already competitive with fracked gas</a> in many parts of the country. This math is the primary reason <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/business/energy-environment/coronavirus-oil-wind-solar-energy.html"">why the use of renewables has grown</a> despite the Trump administration&rsquo;s tariffs on solar cells and panels, and its withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania needs <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/clean-energy"">more clean energy jobs</a><span id=""docs-internal-guid-91bed888-7fff-4e7b-ca45-a3c01629191f""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">&mdash;</span></span>jobs that support Pennsylvania&rsquo;s communities and safeguard its wildlife and natural resources. What&rsquo;s more, the only major impediment to a total transition toward renewables has been largely attenuated by better and more affordable utility-scale storage options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The COVID-19 epidemic offers us <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-COVID-19-A-Green-Recovery"">an unprecedented opportunity</a> to rethink the way we use and generate energy. Let&rsquo;s make the most of it.</p>

"PennFuture Joins Forces with Businesses and Community Members to Launch the ""Pledge to Defend Our Pocono Waters"" Campaign",7/6/2020,"<p>Recreation areas across Pennsylvania are experiencing unprecedented number of visitors. When I first left my house following quarantine, I felt like a trout fry emerging from the gravel. I was so eager to follow the sunlight, stretch my fins and find some escape from anxieties of the COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Observers note that by June the condition of many trails appeared as though they already received as much foot traffic as usually experienced by the end of the summer season. As restrictions are lifted, outfitters are experiencing a flood of interest for water-based activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Across Pennsylvania our outdoor spaces are so important for the health of our residents, the social fabric of our communities and the economic vitality of our small businesses and commercial corridors. This is especially true when considering the role of clean waters to the Poconos Mountain region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To help ensure local leaders recognize the importance of Exceptional Value streams during this time of economic recovery, PennFuture is participating in a new campaign led by <a href=""http://www.ourpoconowaters.org/"">Our Pocono Waters</a>.&nbsp;<br />
A partnership of businesses, clean water advocates and outdoor recreation enthusiasts, Our Pocono Waters is launching a new pledge campaign to demonstrate the broad base of support for clean water protections. <a href=""https://youtu.be/wT2Cb0CtMzM"">Check out the ad airing this summer</a> on WNEP, the most watched station in Northeastern Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Partners who have stepped up to pledge to defend the region&rsquo;s waterways include outfitters, breweries and other small business leaders, as well as fishing, conservation and environmental groups.&nbsp;<br />
If you find yourself valuing clean waters and outdoor recreation now more than ever, please consider joining the pledge campaign. Pledge to defend stream protections. Then share how you and your family enjoy the clean waters of the Pocono Mountains region. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/ourpoconowaters/index.html"">Pledge to defend Our Pocono Waters</a>.</p>

<p>While only 2 percent&nbsp;of Pennsylvania streams are Exceptional Value &mdash; the classification granted to the cleanest streams with highest quality of water &mdash; <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/EV-one-pager-FINAL-7.26.18.pdf"">80 percent&nbsp;are located in the Poconos Mountain region</a>, primarily within Monroe, Pike and Wayne counties. These include many headwaters to the upper and middle sections of the Delaware River. Exceptional Value streams support some of the country&rsquo;s premiere wild trout populations, offering recreational benefits, natural beauty and other important ecosystem services.</p>

<p>Outdoor recreation and other tourism activities continue to drive the economy of the Pocono Mountains region. Exceptional Value streams are at the heart of what makes the region such a tourism destination.</p>

<p>The Our Pocono Waters campaign has previously called on local officials to publicly support the ability for the PA Department of Environmental Protection and Environmental Quality Board to safeguard Pocono streams through appropriate Exceptional Value designations. The 2018 campaign collected more than 3,300 petition signatures from across the Poconos community.</p>

<p>This time around, Our Pocono Waters is featuring voices of the community who most stand to benefit from continued Exceptional Value protections. <a href=""https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCWXXvnYjfkMH4sj2H2u0IVQ/videos/upload?filter=%5B%5D&amp;sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D"">Watch some of the videos</a> we received so far.</p>

PennFuture Secures Two Legal Victories in One Week,7/1/2020,"<p>At PennFuture, we take great pride in being Pennsylvania&rsquo;s watchdog for clean air, pure water and a healthy environment. We approach our work through multiple facets, one of which involves flexing our legal muscle and protecting our environment through litigation in local, state and federal courts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the course of our 22-year history, PennFuture has achieved significant and meaningful legal victories and, just this week, we received word that two cases had been resolved in our favor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first victory, <a href=""https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/AlleghenyDefenseProjectetalvFERCDocketNo1701098DCCirMar232017Cour/5?1593554996"">handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit</a>, involved the use of so-called &ldquo;tolling orders&rdquo; by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Tolling orders allow an agency or court to pause or delay the running of time to take action that is set forth in a statute. Put simply, for many years FERC used these tolling orders to indefinitely delay reviewing complaints from property owners who wished to protect their property from fracked gas and pipeline development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, FERC used tolling orders in 99 percent of the cases between 2009 and 2017 in which property owners, organizations, and other aggrieved parties asked for rehearings of FERC decisions involving pipeline projects. Until the rehearing request was finally decided upon, the parties were prevented from challenging FERC&rsquo;s decision in court.</p>

<p>Most concerningly, even as these parties were blocked from having their day in court, pipeline companies could rely on the decisions to condemn private property and begin construction, resulting in irreparable harm to property and the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankfully, the D.C. Circuit on Tuesday ruled that FERC cannot indefinitely delay the review of these complaints. This decision gives landowners, environmental groups, and environmental justice communities who are disproportionately burdened by pipeline infrastructure back our right to challenge FERC&rsquo;s decisions before the irreparable harm from pipeline construction can occur.</p>

<p>PennFuture, which was represented by EarthJustice in this case, was just one of several entities that submitted an amici curiae (&ldquo;friend of the court&rdquo;) brief in the case challenging the illegal use of these tolling order , and we are thankful for the court&rsquo;s ruling. To read more about this case, <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2020/06/federal-appeals-court-stops-fercs.html"">click here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second legal victory, <a href=""https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/01_Enviro_Complaint_04-15-2019.pdf"">handed down by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California</a>, involved a case where PennFuture and other organizations, again represented by EarthJustice, sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to properly regulate coke ovens like those found at U.S. Steel&rsquo;s plant outside of Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2005, the EPA publicly acknowledged that carcinogenic emissions from coke ovens destroy air quality and cause devastating health complications, yet the agency also admitted it wasn&rsquo;t sure that its regulations were protecting communities located near these coke plants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No new rules or regulations have come forth from the EPA in the 15 years since that admission, and this lawsuit demanded that EPA finally take action and craft regulations that protect citizens who live near these dangerous plants. In response to our lawsuit, EPA conceded liability and admitted that they had failed to establish three of the necessary standards to protect human health and the environment as alleged in our lawsuit. The court set a 30-month deadline for the EPA to act on these rules, which is a significant victory for public health.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both of these court decisions are significant victories for citizens across America whose rights to clean air and clean water have been denied for far too long. These decisions are also further evidence that PennFuture will not stand idly by as corporate polluters and our federal government trample on our rights solely in the name of profits.&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture’s Legal Internship Program Helps to Train and Inspire the Next Generation of Environmental Lawyers in Pennsylvania,6/30/2020,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past 20 years, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognized that we need to be more involved with cultivating the legal talent that will continue to support our mission. Our attorneys have a long history of mentoring legal interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This year, with the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haus Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor law students interested in making a difference for our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting the State as well as to further their potential careers in environmental law.</p>

<p>Speaking from personal experience, the ability of law students to have meaningful legal internships at non-profit organizations is often compromised by the need to financially support oneself while attending law school. We hope that over the coming years, our ability to provide a paid legal internship opportunity will allow for a greater diversity of students and flexibility to be a part of PennFuture and the non-profit environmental law community in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This summer, we have a fantastic group of law students for our inaugural internship class, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We&rsquo;ve asked our summer legal interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</p>

<p><strong>Megan Rulli, a rising second-year law student at Penn State Dickinson School of Law. Ms. Rulli is working&nbsp;on a variety of legal matters impacting our water resources across the state.</strong></p>

<p>I come to environmental law after a decade in the world of small-scale, sustainable agriculture. I&rsquo;ve switched to a career in law in order to understand and shape environmental policy.&nbsp;PennFuture is an organization that is working on many levels to make the change I believe necessary to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment for future generations.&nbsp;I feel lucky to be part of a group of people that organizes communities at the grass roots level, works with decision makers to implement meaningful environmental policy, and makes strategic legal challenges that protect the earth and result in long term change.</p>

<p>I first became interested in law as an environmental activist in college, where I saw the power of law as a tool for change. While as students we held meetings and dreamed of change, lawyers were able to enter rooms with decision makers and get things done.&nbsp;I hope to do the same in my legal career.&nbsp;This summer I have the pleasure of seeing the legal standards that protect the environment in action and of participating in campaigns that ensure those standards have teeth.&nbsp;Like farming, law is both challenging and rewarding, and I am excited to take my first steps in this field with PennFuture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Timothy Wolff, a rising third-year law evening student at the University of Maryland, Francis King Carey School of Law. Mr. Wolff is working with Rob Altenburg on energy and climate issues, including PA&rsquo;s Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) plan.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I grew up on a rural Columbia County dairy farm.&nbsp; Tucked among the state&#39;s rolling hills and close to natural treasures like Ricketts Glen State Park, I developed a deep appreciation for the area&#39;s scenic beauty.&nbsp;After college, I spent several years working for a renewable energy company in Lebanon County.&nbsp;Our work not only added badly-needed jobs to the region and produced environmental benefits, but strengthened the balance sheets of our customers&#39; farms and rural small businesses.</p>

<p>I care about environmental issues because having a world that can continually provide food, housing, and resources in the quantities necessary to sustain our communities while population continues to climb is huge challenge that affects everyone.&nbsp;Invention and transformation are hallmarks of the American economy, and I feel that there is a great deal of opportunity to both move us towards a sustainable path while promoting economic prosperity.</p>

<p><strong>Richard Marcil, a rising third-year law student at Widener Law School. Mr. Marcil is working with both me and Rob on matters ranging from developing the federal policy initiative for the Reimagine Appalachia collaboration to researching energy and climate issues for our Energy Center.</strong></p>

<p>Everyone has a right to clean air, water, and soil. Environmental law is the toolbox with which we protect these rights. But environmental law does more than just safeguard human health and wellness. It also protects animals, their habitats, and ecosystems. It ensures we can grow healthy food in a sustainable manner. And it helps us secure economic prosperity. At a time when climate change is accelerating and federal regulators are rolling back environmental rules and enforcement efforts, the work PennFuture is doing to fight for these rights and benefits is more vital now than ever.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team is dedicated to restoring and protecting our environment and communities, to protecting our right to clean air and pure water, and to moving Pennsylvania toward a clean energy future. I thank our amazing staff and legal interns for their great work, and also our members for your continued support. We can&rsquo;t do this without you!&nbsp;</p>

At the Bottom of a Steep Learning Curve,6/19/2020,"<p>Since the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police in late May, we have witnessed an ignition of individual, communal and global action against racism, injustice and inequality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>People are mobilized in anger and in peace, hearts and minds are active and anguished, and consciences are toiling. Aligned institutions, organizations and businesses are grappling with responsibility, and endeavoring to respond and support.</p>

<p>And so it is at PennFuture. My thinking about what the diversity work implanted throughout our 2019 strategic plan would look like has been thoroughly upended.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s overly simplistic to say that I anticipated a great deal of our effort would play out the way it has been described in trainings we&rsquo;ve been exposed to&mdash;fairly prescriptive pathways and a lot of checking of boxes. I had anticipated that organizational culture would need to be explored, and assessed, and eventually transformed.</p>

<p>But I did not grasp, until now, and because of now, the extent to which the work must begin with conversations about racism, bigotry and hatred. These conversations have always been part of the diversity curriculum&nbsp;but now stand at the front of a long line of issues we must work our way through in an aspiration to be an inclusive, diverse, fair and just organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I knew a path to diversity would be painful and difficult, but I thought it might be a collective pain and discomfort, and now am figuring out the discomfort will be felt personally and deeply. But it will never be commensurate to the pain and hurt America has laid on communities of color since the birth of this country and right up to today.</p>

<p>Over the last weeks, the PennFuture staff that I work with has responded so admirably, and with so much bravery and leadership. The environmental community wants to be a leader in helping solve racism and prejudice, but do we really have a clue to how that can happen?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe we do, and I believe that knowledge at PennFuture resides with our younger and newer staff members who bring diversity and fresh ideas to the table, but also deeply personal experiences that have shaped their worldviews and perspectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These individuals have stood up with a generosity of spirit, with clear words and thoughts and with an insistence that they be heard within the organization. They are pushing our organization forward. They have expectations and desires for the future and realize we are in a moment when the time to assert them is ripe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This team wants our organization to be an ally to the marginalized people of our state, to find new partners, to understand from them how we can use our privilege and access and resources and yes, expertise, in service to these impacted communities and the issues they prioritize. Will it always be possible for us to help? Probably not, but we must figure out some mechanisms and programs to contribute.</p>

<p>On Monday, June 1, after the first weekend of justice actions took place throughout the state, PennFuture <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-issues-statement-in-reaction-to-recent-events"">offered a brief statement of solidarity</a> for the justice activists and their calls for change.&nbsp;Since the next day, June 2, was Election Day, we included our hopes that everyone who is eligible to vote is registered to vote, and voting regularly as one pathway to that change. In fact, that is one goal of PennFuture&rsquo;s new Democracy for All program, which reaches out to communities of color and provides civic engagement opportunities.</p>

<p>We grasp that the same dynamics of power that have perpetuated racism also have systematically manipulated the people&rsquo;s ability to engage with, and have faith in, our elections and civic opportunities.&nbsp;But I hope we do not give up on our democracy or the American flag as a symbol of our dreams and vision for the future.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve shared some early thoughts here but to say more would immediately put me back in a place where I think I know something I really don&rsquo;t, which is what the road to diversity will look like for PennFuture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will have contributions to make to that future, along with many others here. It is within my ability and control to say with certainty the matter will not be relegated to the back burner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"Fracked Gas, Petrochemical Industries Continue to Overpromise and Underdeliver for Pennsylvanians",6/18/2020,"<p>A core tenant of our mission at PennFuture is working to secure a better and brighter future for all Pennsylvanians, and a large part of that mission is protecting our basic rights to clean air and pure water.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a significant threat to those rights has emerged in the form of the fracked gas and petrochemical industries, which are trying to further entrench and intertwine themselves into our political landscape and economy.</p>

<p>The industries attempt to woo our small and mid-sized communities with promises of revitalization and economic prosperity, all while promising to be stringent and responsible protectors of our shared environment and natural resources.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re lying. These claims aren&rsquo;t hard to debunk: in the last week alone, four news stories have been published that expose the financial realities of fracked gas and petrochemicals, as well as those industries&rsquo; complete disregard for the health of Pennsylvanians and our environment.</p>

<p>The first story concerns a group of economists, engineers, policy analysts and former policymakers who banded together <a href=""https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200615/cracker-plant-wonrsquot-bring-petrochemical-jobs-boom-to-ohio-experts-warn"">to issue a letter to the governors of Pennsylvania</a>, Ohio, and West Virginia , stressing that a reliance on petrochemicals for prosperity is both dangerous and badly misguided.</p>

<p>The authors&mdash;among them prominent officials like former Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Secretary John Hanger, Executive Director of West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy Ted Boettner, and Carnegie Mellon University Associate Professor of Economics Nicholas Z. Muller&mdash;told the governors that they &ldquo;risk squandering hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds in pursuit of a vision that will not materialize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That vision won&rsquo;t materialize largely because it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly unprofitable. Market conditions are extremely unfavorable as the price of plastic is plummeting, combined with an oversaturation of fracked gas and petrochemical plants that are far outpacing demand.</p>

<p>Simply put, the dream of an Appalachian petrochemical hub is dissipating quickly, but some of our elected officials and policymakers are hesitant to let go and pursue more viable strategies and sound economic development policies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for residents in Beaver County, the decision to cater to the petrochemical industry has already been made, and another report issued last week is showing the folly of that decision.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://insideclimatenews.org/news/03062020/shell-plastics-plant-pittsburgh-coronavirus"">Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns</a> that Shell&rsquo;s massive plastics factory on the banks of the Ohio River won&rsquo;t be nearly as profitable as once thought due to a combination of poor market conditions and the fact that Shell will be making fewer plastics because of global oversupply.</p>

<p>That all spells bad news for a community that was previously decimated by the collapse of the domestic steel industry, and a community that took Shell at its word when the company promised prosperity and economic revitalization.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that a less profitable plastics plant means fewer jobs and far less impact on the local and regional economy. It is also further proof that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s lawmakers in 2012 shouldn&rsquo;t have offered a massive $1.6 billion tax break to lure Shell to Pennsylvania in the first place.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that these industries are not delivering on promises made to Pennsylvanians, but it&rsquo;s even worse that they are also destroying our environment and natural resources in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To that end, Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced on Friday that his office <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/post/range-resources-pleads-no-contest-environmental-crimes-southwest-pa-well-sites#stream/0"">had secured a criminal conviction against Range Resources</a>, one of the largest fracking companies operating in Pennsylvania, for environmental crimes at two separate sites in Washington County.</p>

<p>Specifically, Range Resources pleaded no contest to several environmental crimes after a two-year investigation found the company so heavily polluted a family&rsquo;s drinking water supply that it was rendered &ldquo;dangerous and unsuitable for consumption.&rdquo; In a separate incident, the company so heavily polluted a field in Washington County that 100 trees and 12,000 square feet of soil had to be removed.</p>

<p>As if those environmental crimes aren&rsquo;t enough, the attorney general proved that the company knowingly covered up issues that ultimately led to the contamination of the drinking water supply.</p>

<p>Finally, the attorney general on Monday <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/press-releases/ag-shapiro-and-43rd-statewide-grand-jury-file-criminal-charges-against-nepa-fracking-company/"">announced similar environmental crimes</a> against Cabot Oil and Gas after the company contaminated well water in Dimock, Susquehanna County. In one instance, a landowner held a match to a jug that contained water used for drinking and bathing, and the water caught fire.</p>

<p>Water set ablaze. More than 100 trees permanently removed. A family&rsquo;s drinking supply permanently contaminated. These are very real and very serious incidents, but they are far from the only incidents.</p>

<p>Is the promise of jobs worth the environmental degradation and sickness that accompanies them? Should our elected leaders continue to believe these companies when they promise a better and brighter future?</p>

<p>Keep in mind, these industries beg for and often receive enormous subsidies and tax breaks from our elected officials, and still continue to fail financially even as taxpayers foot the bill. They consistently and purposefully overpromise and underdeliver, then pack up and leave our communities in far worse shape after extracting our resources and destroying our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Time and again we&rsquo;ve been shown the true nature of these industries, both financially and environmentally. It&rsquo;s time we start listening.</p>

<p>Amidst the impacts of the COVID-19 public health crisis, we have seen a significant decline in emissions of air pollution both nationally and in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; As our communities begin the journey to recovery, and emissions rise, we have a duty and an opportunity to protect Pennsylvanians&mdash;especially those that are substantially more vulnerable to COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.</p>

<p>There is no silver bullet to address air pollution. In Pennsylvania, one possible path is a three-pronged approach that includes modernizing and extending our antiquated Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS), strengthening our Act 129 energy efficiency law, and joining our neighbors throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) currently being considered in Harrisburg. With these changes, we can finally begin to bring our energy economy into the 21st century.</p>

<p>A report by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers <a href=""https://www.yorkdispatch.com/story/news/local/2020/02/13/pa-leads-nation-premature-deaths-due-air-pollution-study-finds/4749624002/"">published in February concluded that Pennsylvania</a> leads the lower 48 in premature death rate per capita from air pollution.&nbsp; We paid for this nefarious designation with 4,800 preventable deaths in 2018.&nbsp;While the study recognized cross-border air pollution impacts, it found that Pennsylvanians are largely doing this to ourselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As tragic as this is, this year may be worse&mdash;a Harvard study <a href=""https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/air-pollution-linked-with-higher-covid-19-death-rates/"">recently found that exposure to air pollution</a>, particularly small particulate matter (2.5) dramatically increased the likelihood that those infected with COVID-19 would die.</p>

<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/"">projects an 11 percent decline</a> in energy-related CO2 emissions this year due to stay-at-home orders across the nation. However, that is not a sustainable reduction and emissions are expected to jump 5 percent once we fully reopen.&nbsp;After the Great Recession in 2009, the benefits gained from temporary emission reductions began to quickly evaporate.&nbsp;Nationally, emissions from the energy sector <a href=""https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/"">declined by 7.2 percent in 2009</a> only to rebound by 3.6 percent the following year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those numbers were even larger in Pennsylvania&mdash;we experienced <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/analysis/pdf/table1.pdf"">a massive 9.4 percent reduction</a> but then a 4.9 percent rise in 2010. Our sluggish economy played a role in the 2009 &ndash; 2010 net reduction, yet the dramatic shift towards less-carbon-intensive energy sources was due primarily to the federal American Recovery &amp; Reinvestment Act and the state Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Commonwealth&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.pennaeps.com/"">Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act of 2004</a> requires that by 2021, 8 percent of electricity consumed in Pennsylvania originate from &rdquo;Tier 1&rdquo; renewable sources, with one-half of one percent of that coming from solar power, and 10 percent from &ldquo;Tier 2&rdquo; sources, which sadly includes electric generation from dirty waste coal and other non-renewable sources.&nbsp; Once an aggressive standard 15 years ago, Harrisburg has allowed Pennsylvania to fall woefully behind as our neighbors in Maryland, New Jersey, and New York:<span id=""docs-internal-guid-7ffb90da-7fff-5aed-0fd1-9d99a6c035c5""></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our neighbors have outworked us to become leaders in the clean energy revolution. Significantly, our AEPS requirement plateaus after 2021&mdash;stifling the Commonwealth&rsquo;s momentum of success.&nbsp; Even <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-virginia-renewables/virginia-passes-bill-to-achieve-100-carbon-free-power-by-2045-idUSKBN20T2OF"">Virginia recently committed itself in March</a> to be 100 percent carbon free by 2045. All the while we Pennsylvanians have seen other states with less land and less natural potential for renewables zoom past us.</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2010/geo/state-area.html"">Pennsylvania has 6 times more land</a> and receives <a href=""https://neo.ne.gov/programs/stats/pdf/201_solar_leadership.pdf"">more solar radiance</a> than New Jersey, yet the Garden State <a href=""https://www.seia.org/states-map"">has 3,180 MW of installed solar PV</a> versus 491 MW in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; It is time for the General Assembly to once again spur renewable development and put Pennsylvania on equal footing with our neighbors.</p>

<p>Compounding the issue of our outdated AEPS is the imminent catastrophe heading our way as federal tax credits for renewables will be eliminated, or dramatically reduced, over the next 18 months.&nbsp; The fossil fuel industry <a href=""https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/policy-digests/ending-fossil-fuel-tax-subsidies"">benefits from tax breaks permanently</a> written into the tax code, yet credits for renewables are provided for only a few years, if that long.&nbsp;Two renewable energy sub-sectors are at the top of the expected job growth list over the next decade (keep reading) according to the U.S. Department of Labor.&nbsp; Why should we build roadblocks to progress?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding energy efficiency measures, the Commonwealth <a href=""http://www.puc.state.pa.us/filing_resources/issues_laws_regulations/act_129_information.aspx"">implemented Act 129 in 2008</a>.&nbsp;This enactment created the Energy Efficiency &amp; Conservation (EE&amp;C) Program that has spurred utility rebates for purchasing energy efficient goods.&nbsp;Since its implementation, Act 129 <a href=""https://www.aceee.org/white-paper/lifting-the-cap-040419"">has generated over $6.4 billion in net consumer benefits</a> through the deployment of efficiency measures throughout Pennsylvania. In fact, the program requires not only that targets be cost-effective, but also makes that determination with a very restrictive test that does not even consider health and environmental benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this program <a href=""https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pa-jobs-040419.pdf"">achieved a modest 0.8 percent annual decline</a> in energy consumption across the state, just as with the AEPS, Harrisburg has failed to keep pace with our neighbors leading the charge.&nbsp;New Jersey (1.5 percent), New York (2 percent), and Maryland (2 percent) have all realized&nbsp;the benefits their states recognize with more aggressive efficiency standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Expanding the EE&amp;C Program is perhaps the lowest hanging fruit in Pennsylvania to reduce emissions.&nbsp;The program <a href=""http://www.puc.pa.gov/pcdocs/1656474.pdf"">could easily be doubled or tripled</a> at no net cost to ratepayers. Unfortunately, the program contains an arbitrary investment cap that is prohibiting the Commonwealth and its ratepayers from capturing the full potential of Act 129.&nbsp;The success stories of our neighboring states demonstrates what we are capable of if we get serious about energy efficiency.</p>

<p>On the horizon is <a href=""https://www.rggi.org/"">the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a>, a cooperative effort of 11 Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states that establishes an annual CO2 emissions limit for most power plants and the cap decreases annually by 2.5 percent.&nbsp; Governor Wolf <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/executive-order-2019-07-commonwealth-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change-through-electric-sector-emissions-reductions/"">has issued an Executive Order</a> directing the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to craft draft regulations under the authority granted by the General Assembly in the Air Pollution Control Act (APCA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The initiative provides a market-based solution allowing for pollution credits to be sold, ensuring that CO2 reductions occur from the most cost-effective sources and providing long-term market certainty to stimulate renewable energy deployment.&nbsp;Because the U.S. Congress has been unable to advance a RGGI-like proposal at the national level, states grew tired of waiting on Washington and instead took action to protect their citizens and modernize their economies and energy infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Proceeds from the credits would be reinvested through Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Clean Air Fund to further reduce air pollution by deploying energy efficiency and renewable energy, among other things. These investments have a significant multiplier effect, rippling through the states&rsquo; economies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2017, <a href=""https://www.rggi.org/sites/default/files/Uploads/Proceeds/RGGI_Proceeds_Report_2017.pdf"">RGGI states invested $315 million</a> from the sale of pollution allowances that abated 8,300,000 tons of CO2 emissions by avoiding a whopping 13.9 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, or the <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/units-and-calculators/"">equivalent of over 187,885,000 gallons</a> of gasoline.&nbsp;CO2 emissions from RGGI states have been reduced by 50 percent since 2005, not to mention the reductions of mercury, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter.&nbsp;All of this has taken place as the gross domestic product (GDP) of RGGI states continues to grow faster than the national average.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The size of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s generation sector is comparable to those plants that currently fall under the RGGI umbrella, so it is reasonable to conclude that similar benefits are likely.&nbsp;In 2022, the Commonwealth <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Air/AirQuality/AQPortalFiles/Advisory%20Committees/Air%20Quality%20Technical%20Advisory%20Committee/2020/5-7-20/AQTAC%20PA%20CO2%20Budget%20Trading%20Program.pdf"">has proposed limiting CO2 emissions</a> to 78 million tons, roughly equal to the 74 million ton adjusted limit for the combined RGGI states this year.&nbsp;In Pennsylvania the program is expected to generate $320 million in 2022 that will be reinvested in the state to promote renewable energy, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas abatement, direct bill assistance, and workforce training among other things.&nbsp;</p>

<p>RGGI&rsquo;s 2017 environmental achievements discussed in the preceding paragraph would likely be similar to the benefits Pennsylvania would realize in 2022.&nbsp;After 2022, CO2 emission limits are decreased by approximately 2.5 million tons annually until 2030 when the limit reaches 58 million tons, or 25 percent below 2005 levels.&nbsp;Innovation and smart policies both clean our air and energize our economy as our country continues to speed away from coal.&nbsp;Virginia commitmented to RGGI this year, and now it is time for Pennsylvania to step up to the plate too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many people still think Pennsylvania is powered by coal, but that simply is no longer true. Coal&rsquo;s role has been dramatically reduced because of the transition to natural gas generation.&nbsp; At the beginning of the gas boom, in 2004, <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/mark-szybist/will-pas-coal-plants-survive-if-pa-rejects-rggi#:~:text=The%20Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Environmental,Greenhouse%20Gas%20Initiative%20(RGGI)."">Pennsylvania generated 55 percent of our electricity</a> from coal. Fast-forward 15 years to 2019 and coal accounted for only 17 percent of electric generation.&nbsp; Natural gas during the same period increased from 5 percent to 43 percent of our electric generation portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2019 Pennsylvania&rsquo;s largest coal plant, the Bruce Mansfield Plant operated by First Energy in Beaver County, <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2019/08/12/states-largest-coal-fired-power-plant-to-shutter-early/#:~:text=Bruce%20Mansfield%20Power%20Plant%2C%20for,people%20work%20at%20the%20plant."">retired&nbsp;two years earlier than expected</a> after losing $90 million in 2017 and projecting a $104 million loss in 2018.&nbsp;Only five large coal plants remain in the Commonwealth, and they are also all nearing retirement.&nbsp;Simply put, coal-fired generation is not cost-competitive.&nbsp;It is on its way out and it is not coming back.&nbsp;We must now look forward, not back, and smooth the natural transition away from coal to cleaner renewable sources with programs like RGGI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we continually fight for cleaner energy, we also must be mindful of those impacted by this inevitable change and assist in the transition.&nbsp;The good news is that green jobs are here.&nbsp;Pennsylvania had <a href=""https://e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-pennsylvania-2019/"">90,000 green energy jobs in 2018</a>, up from 57,000 in 2014, ranking 11th nationally.&nbsp;In fact, the industry in Pennsylvania swelled 5 times faster than overall job growth in the state. The 2019 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER) found that <a href=""https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-jobs-in-renewable-energy-energy-efficiency-and-resilience-2019"">the energy efficiency sector had the highest job growth</a> in the entire energy industry, posting 5.37 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that&mdash;across the entire U.S. economy&mdash;solar PV and wind energy jobs <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm"">are expected to grow at the fastest rate</a> over the next decade.&nbsp;Renewable energy supports 855,000 jobs in our country, and USEER cited a lack of skilled workforce as the central constraint to growth. There is a clearly burgeoning&nbsp; job market starving for trained labor.&nbsp;Let us bridge the gap by joining RGGI and helping to train those affected by our natural shift away from coal instead of just leaving them out in the cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout modern history, environmental initiatives have played a prominent role in bringing our economy back and preparing America to march forward, more resilient than before.&nbsp;As part of the New Deal, <a href=""https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/civilian-conservation-corps"">FDR created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)</a> in 1933 during the Great Depression. Also known as &ldquo;Roosevelt&rsquo;s Tree Army,&rdquo; over 3 million Americans worked on environmental projects in the decade that followed.&nbsp;More recently, at the height of The Great Recession in 2009, the <a href=""https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/25/fact-sheet-recovery-act-made-largest-single-investment-clean-energy"">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act spearheaded</a> the clean energy revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are once again afforded an opportunity to move Pennsylvania forward while promoting economic revitalization, protecting those with increased susceptibility to COVID-19, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, smoothing labor&rsquo;s transition away from coal-fired generation, and bringing our energy infrastructure into the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The way in which we can achieve this tomorrow is by finally updating the Commonwealth&rsquo;s AEPS and EE&amp;C Program to align with our neighbors, and utilizing the market-based RGGI to reduce CO2 emissions and reinvest the Initiative&rsquo;s proceeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is once again time to step forward.</p>

",Climate; Energy; Environment,"Timothy Wolff, Legal Intern"
Pennsylvania’s House Environmental Committee Approves Bill Removing DEP’s Authority to Enact Carbon Reduction Program,6/9/2020,"<p>On June 9, the House Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committee, chaired by Representative Daryl Metcalfe (Butler), met to consider House Bill 2025 (Struzzi). Instead of passing critical climate legislation that would curb Pennsylvania&rsquo;s carbon emission pollution and combat the air quality challenges of our Commonwealth, Metcalfe&rsquo;s committee approved legislation that would usurp authority from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to enact a carbon reduction program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture is adamantly opposed to HB 2025 and frustrated with the legislators who voted to advance the bill to the full House floor for consideration.</p>

<p>Despite being in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and battling an illness that aggressively attacks the respiratory system, the House Environmental Committee saw it necessary to spend time today in the People&rsquo;s House peddling mistruths and conflating serious environmental policy with a suite of fables about &ldquo;Tinkerbell outfits and unicorns,&rdquo; communism, troubling disdain for &ldquo;Dictator Wolf&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Chinese virus,&rdquo; and vegetable gardening techniques. Following what has become a pattern for this Committee, today&rsquo;s proceedings were absurd, dangerous and far afield of the behavior of credible elected officials.</p>

<p>The truth is that Governor Tom Wolf&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/executive-order-2019-07-commonwealth-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change-through-electric-sector-emissions-reductions/"">Executive Order 2019-07</a> instructed the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Model-shows-RGGI-would-reduce-pollution-by-180-million-tons"">develop a cap-and-invest program</a> to control carbon pollution from power plants in Pennsylvania that aligns with the RGGI. And that&rsquo;s exactly what the current rule package does. Instead of letting power plants dump carbon pollution into our air for free, they will have to pay a price that is determined through an auction. In addition, millions of dollars in proceeds from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s participation in RGGI could and should be reinvested in our communities via air quality projects.</p>

<p>The truth is that joining RGGI would allow Pennsylvania to make crucial dents in its carbon pollution while simultaneously raising millions of dollars in the process. RGGI states <a href=""https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/01/power-plant-emissions-down-47-percent-under-the-regional-greenhouse-gas-initiative/"">have reduced their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 47 percent</a>, outpacing the rest of the nation by 90 percent. Scientists and economists <a href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/what-economists-say-about-carbon-pricing/"">both agree that carbon pricing</a> is one of the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Further, reducing air pollution would save hundreds of lives, tens of thousands of hours of lost work, lead to strong net job creation, and result in an overall total of $5.7 billion dollars in benefits.</p>

<p>Utilizing the &ldquo;polluter-pays&rdquo; principle is a meaningful way of combating this pollution. Rather than subsidizing the cost of pollution for dirty plants, we would monetize the costs of that pollution and let the market make better-informed choices about what power to buy. The ten RGGI states <a href=""https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">have seen $1.4 billion in net economic benefits</a> from 2015 to 2017. By linking Pennsylvania&rsquo;s air quality program with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Commonwealth could bring in as much as $350-500 million annually.</p>

<p>It was made clear today by Chairman Metcalfe&rsquo;s own revelation that attacking RGGI is nothing more than another attempt to undermine Governor Wolf. In his own words, Metcalfe said that &ldquo;impeachment is the only way to stop him.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s increasingly evident that this is a part of a grander scheme, and one that has shown for a long time to be anti-science and anti-reason.These games convey that the House leadership is not interested in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s&rsquo; clean air and financial growth, but instead solely focused on protecting their polluter friends.</p>

<p>Thankfully, environmental champions on the House Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committee stood up and put facts on record in the committee room, which is shuttered to the public.</p>

<p>Rep. Leanne Krueger (Delaware) rightfully made the case that the &ldquo;power for the Governor to join compacts [for Pennsylvania] is clearly in the Constitution,&rdquo; and argued that, &ldquo;we have a constitutional [duty] to protect clean air and pure water for all Pennsylvanians.&rdquo; Minority Chairman Greg Vitali (Delaware) added that, &ldquo;Pennsylvania clearly has authority to regulate carbon based on the [state&rsquo;s] Air Quality Control Act.&rdquo; Rep. Mary Isaacson (Philadelphia) showed that transitions and reinvestment in our communities is essential and that jobs spurred by Pennsylvania joining RGGI could be a great source of family-sustaining jobs for our workers.</p>

<p>Perhaps most compelling were the arguments put forward passionately by Rep. Danielle Friel Otten (Chester) who said that &ldquo;protecting our environment is truly about protecting the health and safety of Pennsylvanians.&rdquo; She mentioned that the leading cause of congenital heart disease and asthma in children is air pollution. Rep. Otten mentioned that joining RGGI has many benefits and that &ldquo;we can use money from RGGI to reinvest in environmental justice communities and communities of color who are disproportionately impacted by the industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We wholly agree, and at the end of the day, as Rep. Otten succinctly and powerfully posited, &ldquo;when we&rsquo;re not protecting our children, seniors, and vulnerable populations, we&rsquo;re not upholding our constitutional duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PennFuture will continue to oppose this cavalier legislation and its companion bill in the Senate&mdash;SB 950 (Pittman)&mdash;and will continue to advocate for the advancement of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s RGGI rulemaking package, which will bring about significant reduction to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s carbon pollution along with increased economic benefits.</p>
",Climate; Energy; Environment,"Ezra P. Thrush, Senior Director of Government Affairs"
Looking in the Rearview Mirror,6/8/2020,"<p>In all honesty, by 1994 after six years leading two environmental movements&mdash;the PA Rainforest Action Committee and Central PA Earth Day Committee&mdash;I became disillusioned that the 20th anniversary of Earth Day would reignite&nbsp;action from Washington to address the threat of global warming, as it was referred to then. For the next 10 years my activism took the form of writing, publishing and studying this country&rsquo;s history of environmental irresponsibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2004, John Hanger&mdash;the first Executive Director of PennFuture&mdash;asked me to join the Board of Directors of the organization. At the time, their motto was &ldquo;Every environmental victory is an economic success.&rdquo; Bingo! I found my tribe.</p>

<p>PennFuture has always, even from inception, been highly respected within Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental community. Where it had tremendous impact was in the halls of the Capitol. Those were &lsquo;good times&rsquo; for the environment.</p>

<p>We had the ear of Governor Ed Rendell, who had faith in Hanger and PennFuture. There was more balance in the legislature. DEP and DCNR were doing good work and our Energy Center was busy paving inroads for alternatives and throughout those years, our funding from Heinz and Pew Foundations remained strong. In sum, the staff of PennFuture were laying the foundation of what would become a distinguished environmental organization in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>By 2008 we were celebrating our 10th anniversary with Vice President Al Gore in attendance to support us. Mr. Gore describe PennFuture as &ldquo;the only statewide environmental organization in the country with a three-tier focus of policy, legal and energy work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were riding high on successes until the chessboard pieces shifted. Hanger moved onto head DEP, Gov. Tom Corbett replaced Rendell, and the Marcellus Shale created new environmental challenges while gaining more influence on policy.</p>

<p>At the same time, PennFuture was going through what seemed like a revolving door of leadership. In hindsight, these were the most challenging years for the board. I give credit to the leadership of Chair David Lane for guiding the organization through several years of executive searches. For both the staff and the board members, it was our commitment to PennFuture&rsquo;s mission as &ldquo;the watchdogs of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment&rdquo; that we refreshed our efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By 2014, I moved into the Chair&rsquo;s shoes and we were again searching for an Executive Director. In 2015 PennFuture was fortunate to hire Larry Schweiger who had recently stepped down from the National Wildlife Federation. To be frank, we felt we hit payday. And it turns out we did.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Larry brought new ideas and opened doors for the organization. It was Larry&rsquo;s leadership that began the conversation to partner with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, which has strengthened our policy and advocacy work and expanded PennFuture&rsquo;s influence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Larry insisted he hire Jacquelyn Bonomo as his chief operating officer. Jacqui came with decades of environmental leadership and discipline, and she brought structure to the organization and always had an ear for my input, which made working with her one of the highlights of my tenure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Jacqui became President/CEO in 2017 and hired Matt Stepp as chief operating officer, they began restructuring PennFuture to meet the political, environmental, financial and personnel challenges of the time. This was hard work that required serious communication, organization and action. Throughout, the board was there to guide and support this transition.</p>

<p>During my time with PennFuture, I have witnessed the organization being transformed into a highly organized, focused and impressive instrument for change. Our reach throughout Pennsylvania has expanded beyond anything I could have imagined 16 years ago when I joined the board.</p>

<p>I leave PF confident and grateful. Confident that the executives are clear, dedicated and driven leaders. Grateful that climate change is now a main focus of PennFuture and grateful for my fellow board members who have always taken their position seriously and when needed, rolled up their sleeves, put in the time and got the work done with the understanding they are the caretakers of this important organization.</p>

<p><u><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Though she wouldn&rsquo;t admit it, Char Magaro was working on climate change issues long before anyone else was really aware of it. Her activism on this issue, and others, emanates from her early work advocating for rainforest protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, Char allowed PennFuture to use her restaurants for fundraisers and other events. We always knew that our guests would feel welcomed and really appreciate Char&rsquo;s high standards and hospitality.</p>

<p>Char was key to the success of PennFuture&rsquo;s 10th anniversary gala. She conceived the look and the style of the event so that it rose to fit the stellar line of speakers including Al Gore, Rebecca Rimmel of Pew Charitable Trusts, and Teresa Heinz of The Heinz Endowments. It was elegant, coordinated and it ran smoothly because of Char&rsquo;s attention to detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Char was essential in the transition and recruitment of PennFuture&rsquo;s CEOs, often a time consuming process, not once but twice. Hours of meetings and interviews were involved in this process.&nbsp;Char had great influence on the board, many times offering a point of view which was unique and creative. She blended well with all of the different personalities and thought big picture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For 16 years Char been a significant part of the life of PennFuture, as we have been part of her life.&nbsp; She has supported us financially, offered wise guidance, floated many ideas, led the board ably as chair, and has been an inspiration and friend to many of us.</p>

Trump Administration Rolls Back Air Protections from Fossil Fuel Plants,6/5/2020,"<p>Recently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency rolled back protections under the federal Mercury Air Toxics Standards regulations for both coal refuse plants and oil- and gas-fired plants.</p>

<p>The MATS for coal-and oil-fired electric generating units (EGUs) were promulgated by EPA on February 16, 2012.&nbsp; MATS established acid gas hazardous air pollutant emission standards for all coal-fired power plants.</p>

<p>If you live in Cambria or Venango County and want to help us fight against increased air pollution in your community, please contact PennFuture&rsquo;s Vice President of Legal &amp; Policy, Abigail Jones, by Friday, June 12. She can be reached at&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:jones@pennfuture.org"">jones@pennfuture.org</a> or by calling 570-216-3313.</p>

<p><u>Coal Refuse Plants</u></p>

<p>On April 15, EPA finalized a subcategory for plants, which would impact six EGUs that burn waste coal from other coal mining operations and use the ashes of mine reclamation projects. Four of those units (at three plants) are located in Pennsylvania: Scrubgrass Generating Company (Kennerdell, PA); Colver Power Project (Colver, PA); and Ebensburg Power (Ebensburg, PA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem with this new subcategory is that it allows for more acid gas pollution from these plants. But, these plants were already meeting or certified to EPA that they would meet the acid gas emission limits set under the MATS, indicating that a subcategory that allows these facilities to pollute more is unjustified for the safe and continued operation of these plants.</p>

<p><u>Oil and Gas Fired Plants</u></p>

<p>On May 22,&nbsp;EPA issued an about-face regarding its 2016 decision that it is &ldquo;appropriate and necessary&rdquo; to regulate hazardous air pollutants from oil-and gas-fired EGUs under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA now claims that it is not appropriate and necessary to regulate emission these air toxics because the costs outweigh the benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EPA&rsquo;s reversal of its prior determination, however, is based upon fundamental legal errors, flawed reasoning (including the failure to consider all benefits from the regulation), and is unauthorized under the CAA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In April 2019, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Comments-of-Environmental-Public-Health-and-Civil-Rights-Orgs_.pdf"">PennFuture joined others in submitting comments</a> in opposition to both the proposed subcategory rule and EPA&rsquo;s revised &ldquo;appropriate and necessary&rdquo; finding in April 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both of these rollbacks have the potential to negatively impact our air quality in Pennsylvania. Our communities have already been plagued by the onslaught of cuts by the Trump Administration to the fundamental protections of our water quality and environment, and now the EPA is working hard to cut much needed protections to our air quality. We cannot let these unsupported and illegal rollbacks stand.&nbsp; PennFuture will fight for our right to clean air and pure water in Pennsylvania.</p>

"PennFuture Launches the Our Water, Our Future Campaign to Unify Erie Around Clean Water Goals",6/4/2020,"<p>After years of careful and intentional planning, PennFuture recently opened a new office in Erie. We initially envisioned an opening that included an office in downtown Erie, a press conference with local media, and a meet-and-greet opportunity for community members to connect with PennFuture leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like every other organization, our best laid plans evaporated in mid-March with the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic that would completely shut down Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy and our ability to travel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of a new office space or the benefit of in-person introductions and conversations, I started my new role as a Campaign Manager for Clean Water virtually with many emails that began &ldquo;I am writing to introduce myself&hellip; I&rsquo;d love to set up a Zoom meeting with you.&rdquo; Not exactly how we envisioned PennFuture&rsquo;s entry into Erie, of course.</p>

<p>I was worried about being able to connect with people and organizations remotely, but I have been incredibly surprised by the positive responses I have received. I have met remotely with dozens of people in northwestern Pennsylvania and beyond through Zoom and phone calls. From citizens and non-profit organizations to government agencies and others, I have been amazed by the breadth of work being done and passion for protecting our water resources. I have also seen the need for that work and its importance to be communicated to a broader audience.</p>

<p>Erie is the fifth PennFuture office to open in Pennsylvania. We now cover all four corners of the state in addition to our strong presence in Harrisburg. By expanding into Erie with the &ldquo;Our Water, Our Future&rdquo; campaign, PennFuture seeks to increase and amplify the voices for the environment and citizens of Erie by developing a coalition of existing organizations dedicated to protecting our most important asset: our water.</p>

<p>The initial goal for PennFuture in Erie is to bring together organizations to develop a Common Agenda for Clean Water Advocacy. The process for developing this agenda has been taking shape with COVID-19, economic struggles, racial inequality, and social unrest in the background.</p>

<p>As I sit meeting with people at my computer to discuss this very specific goal, the world is changing outside my window. It would be na&iuml;ve to think that this endeavor will not be impacted by this changing world. But now more than ever people need to organize and stand up for what is right. It is right to stand against inequality and injustice. It is right to stand up for environmental protection. The two are not mutually exclusive and both are intimately connected with our mental and physical wellbeing.</p>

<p>The intersection between inequality, injustice, and environmental protection is well illustrated by the situation with Erie Coke Corporation. For decades this plant, which sits directly on Presque Isle Bay, continued operations despite routinely skirting environmental regulations. Coal and contaminated waste water escaped into the nearby waterways and emissions with benzene and toluene above DEP action levels were regularly spewed into the air. The community surrounding Erie Coke has a 49 percent poverty rate and its population is 54 percent minority. Clearly an injustice was occurring that was disproportionately born by people who were already disenfranchised.</p>

<p>Citizen activists banded together to demand justice for all of Erie, but especially for the community directly surrounding the plant. They formed a group called Hold Erie Coke Accountable (HECA) and asked citizens to share their experiences. Through these actions, HECA raised awareness of the injustices of Erie Coke and eventually, continuous pressure from citizens and the City of Erie led to the plant&rsquo;s closure.</p>

<p>By unifying around a common goal, citizens and decision makers earned a huge win for Erie and accomplished a step in the right direction to defend the citizens living closest to the plant. I hope to build off of this success on a broader scale and bring people together to continuously protect our water resources, and in doing so, protect our citizens and preserve resources for future generations.</p>

<p>In a time filled with great uncertainty and fear, bringing people together for a positive common goal of protecting water resources has offered me solace and purpose. I look forward to working with the passionate people of Northwest Pennsylvania to advocate for the clean water that our lives and livelihoods depend on.&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture partners with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania on new field organizing program,6/2/2020,"<p>PennFuture has long believed that grassroots engagement is a key part of fulfilling our mission to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s air, water, and land.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To that end, we work to educate community members and inspire volunteers to take action to help protect our environment. We do this through a variety of engaging opportunities, from educational forums to writing Letters to the Editor, contacting our legislators and plenty of actions in between.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, we have built up an <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFutures-Advocates-for-Conservation-and-the-Environment-ACE-Program"">Advocates for Conservation and the Environment (ACE) program</a>, which organizes teams of non-partisan volunteers to educate state and federal legislators about conservation and environmental issues. How can our elected officials vote the right way without knowing the background of the issues?</p>

<p>This year we are excited to announce that we have started a new phase in this important work by creating a joint field program that will work in tandem with our strategic partners at <a href=""https://www.conservationpa.org/"">Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania (CVPA)</a>. The colleagues of the Field Team will build on the great work of both organizations to empower the residents of Pennsylvania to use their voices to advocate for sustainable policies.</p>

<p>The PennFuture and CVPA Field Team aims to make it easy for people to get involved in environmental advocacy. Equally important, we want to connect with the local groups to lift up local voices and help to highlight the work they are doing. Finally, PennFuture and Conservation Voters of PA are two distinct organizations with diverse staff expertise, which allows for great flexibility and varying opportunities for our volunteers.</p>

<p>Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic has required our new field program to reevaluate our initial plans. We were proud to pivot quickly and offer a virtual way to honor the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day through our first joint project:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Thirty-Days-of-Action"">the Act For Our Earth Challenge</a>. We offered one quick meaningful daily action that folks could take right from home; check out the <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/earthday2020"">Archive </a>of actions and join us. Earth Day should be every day, after all!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Field Team will continue to offer virtual programming and opportunities to get involved this year. We will keep a keen eye on how our elected officials are prioritizing our environment amidst this public health crisis. One of our first priorities was watching closely as state legislators <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Pennsylvania-General-Assembly-Punts-on-State-Budget-Passes-Stop-Gap-Measure-with-Level-Funding-for-Environmental-and-Conservation-Priorities"">debated and passed a short-term budget last week</a> that holds steady funding for environmental and conservation agencies and programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To break it down for our members, we&rsquo;re hosting <a href=""https://secure.everyaction.com/K02pzgwvsEiNQJjusicDLw2"">a&nbsp;state budget overview webinar this Thursday, June 4th</a>. Our PennFuture and Conservation Voters of PA policy experts will dive into how the budget process unfolds and how the decisions they&rsquo;ve made will affect our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re incredibly excited about the opportunities we can now provide our members and the strength that our joint Field Team will no doubt add to our vital environmental movement. We know that we won&rsquo;t achieve our goals of a pro-environment Pennsylvania without a strong grassroots movement of residents calling upon our elected officials to vote the right way.&nbsp;</p>

"Pennsylvania General Assembly Punts on State Budget, Passes Stopgap Measure with Level Funding for Environmental and Conservation Priorities",6/1/2020,"<p>Late last week, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a five-month stopgap budget package to fund most of the state government through November 2020. While the state’s education funding has been appropriated for a full year, all other lines, including conservation and environmental protection, were largely funded at flat levels from the current 2019-2020 fiscal year. </p>

<p>PennFuture recognizes this stopgap budget is necessary because of the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, but we are nonetheless pleased that the plan holds steady funding for environmental and conservation agencies that protect our natural resources. Now is not the time to slash funding or otherwise undermine the work being done by these critical agencies, which work every day on behalf of the millions of Pennsylvanians who cherish clean air, pure water and a healthy environment. In addition, it's imperative that our state government makes real and meaningful investments on behalf of our environment as the legislative session moves forward this year.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Five-Month Spending Plan</u></strong></p>

<p>The $25.8 billion spending plan of the budget package was moved by the general fund appropriations bill called House Bill 2387 (Saylor). The legislation unfortunately called for cutting essential funding to the river basin commissions that do critical water quality and quantity work, protecting and restoring our Commonwealth’s rivers and streams. Thankfully, this year’s budget bill did not call for raiding special or dedicated environmental and conservation funds that are restricted and statutorily set aside for conservation projects.</p>

<p>The House and Senate will have to return to the appropriations work in Harrisburg after the November 3, 2020 election for a ‘sine die’—or ‘lame-duck’—legislative session to hammer out a supplemental appropriations bill for the remainder of the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Pennsylvania hasn’t seen a sine die session for almost 15 years and proponents of “good government” are rightfully concerned; legislators voting on the supplemental budget may be retiring or may have been defeated, but would still retain their seats for this session. Because of this and the projected $5.2 billion budget shortfall for this and next fiscal years, climbing out of this hole for funding will be a challenge. Filling this hole and even moving Pennsylvania to adequate investment levels for conservation and environmental protection will be a steep climb. </p>

<p>Some Members of the legislature will call for draconian cuts to these resources agencies and will try to move austerity measures like gutting our dedicated funds, such as the Environmental Stewardship Fund, Keystone Recreation, Parks, and Conservation Fund, and more. We must remember that these areas are not fluff that we can cut indiscriminately, but these are core functions of our state government. We must protect these funds and move to invest more in these agencies that have been cut more than 40 percent since 2002.</p>

<p><u><strong>What About Code Bills?</strong></u></p>

<p>In addition to the appropriations bill, the General Assembly often passes associated “code bills” that implement the budget across different areas. These code bills are often used to move nefarious pieces of legislation that, by themselves, wouldn’t make it through the legislature.</p>

<p>This year we tracked and analyzed an administrative code bill and two fiscal code bills that were a part of the budget package. First was the administrative code bill called Senate Bill 1027 (Gordner). For the most part, SB 1027 was ‘clean’ of bad policy riders, but did include a requirement for the Governor and his administration to notify the legislature when regulations would be suspended (temporary or otherwise) along with the normal processes already in place. This may create increased work and bureaucracy for an already underfunded and understaffed agency.</p>

<p>What’s more, we typically see a fiscal code bill accompany the state budget bill to direct and implement the spending plan. Due to COVID-19, this year we had an additional fiscal code bill—House Bill 2510 (Turzai)—moving federal dollars that have been spent to Harrisburg per the CARES Act from earlier this spring for response efforts. Even more troubling was the passage of the regular fiscal code bill—House Bill 1083 (Sankey)—which we called on the legislature to oppose its passage.</p>

<p>HB 1083 contains a shell-game of moving money from the personal income tax (PIT) revenue to support the Environmental Stewardship Fund (ESF/’Growing Greener’); for the last few years we have seen transfers of money from the Oil and Gas Lease Fund to the Environmental Stewardship Fund, via the Marcellus Legacy Fund, but that move was blocked per the fiscal code of the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most concerning provision slipped into HB 1083 and approved by the General Assembly and signed into law by Governor Wolf is a dangerous paragraph extending ‘preemption’ language for another 12 months OR until six months after the expiration of Governor Wolf’s March 6, 2020 disaster declaration and any renewals, whichever is later.</p>

<p>The bill explicitly says that it “prohibits the General Assembly or a local government from enacting or enforcing a law relating to the use, disposition, sale, or prohibition or restriction of single-use plastics.” Another giveaway to the plastics and petrochemical industry from our legislative leadership; it’s also another thumb in the eye of local governments and environmental advocates trying to move forward sound policy and solutions for their communities.</p>

<p>We appreciate the work of our environmental champions on this issue in the legislature, especially Leader Costa and Minority Appropriations Chairman Hughes in the Senate and Minority Environmental Resources Chairman Vitali and Minority Appropriations Chairman Bradford in the House.  </p>

<p><u><strong>Budget Advocacy is Critical</strong></u></p>

<p>This year’s budget week was full of drama, and the budget process in Pennsylvania still isn’t anything close to transparent or inviting of public participation and input outside of a small circle of insiders and leaders in the “Peoples’ House.” Despite the pandemic restrictions put in place this year, PennFuture has remained a leader for the environmental community in the trenches of this year’s budget fight and worked hard to keep up environmental investments and keep out bad policy. Budget advocacy, it’s true, took a different form this time around, but our mission remained to ensure Pennsylvania’s budget is a ‘moral document’ and a values statement. </p>

<p>It’s been said, often tongue-in-cheek, that if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu. We will continue to make sure the voices of the environmental and conservation advocates are at the table as we wrap up legislative session in Harrisburg this spring and as we piece together the second half of our Commonwealth’s budget package in the fall.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fighting-for-Our-Future"">More than 100 people turned out</a> to encourage Gov.&nbsp;Wolf&rsquo;s veto of House Bill 1100, which would have provided ridiculous incentives and billions in taxpayer subsidies to lure more petrochemical plants to Pennsylvania.&nbsp;We&rsquo;re very glad to say that the Governor did veto the bill, though the Legislature could still mount an attempt to override that veto. We are proud to have packed the room during the rally, but it&rsquo;s obvious that more people would have attended if not for fears about the coronavirus pandemic, which was just starting to spread in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>A week later on March 16,&nbsp;all PennFuture staff were working from home, and all PennFuture events had been either cancelled or postponed. It was up to us to improvise and find a way to still do our important work virtually, in accordance with quarantine and stay-at-home orders implemented in mid-March.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our first effort at working within the new normal was partnering with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania. In that partnership, we were able to successfully pivot the in-person Earth Day events we had planned <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Thirty-Days-of-Action"">into a 30-Day Challenge online</a> to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day virtually.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other events were left in limbo, including our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Event-PennFutures-Sixth-Annual-Celebrating-Women-in-Conservation-Awards"">6th Annual Women in Conservation Awards Dinner</a>. It was to be held on April 30th at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, and we were really looking forward to it! Each year, PennFuture honors the accomplishments of exceptional women conservationists in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The awards are designed to encourage continuing excellence in conservation and to forge a stronger network of exceptional women working to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment. Each year the event moves to a different part of the state to honor these women: this year to Southwest Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>With a list like this it would have been a night to remember. Having it at the National Aviary would have made it unforgettable. The Aviary is a bird-lover&rsquo;s treasure. Two years ago PennFuture hosted a fundraising party there to honor our retiring president Larry Schweiger. A bald eagle greeted our guests across from the check-in table. Cocktails were had with flamingos. Along with the amazing food and beverages served in view of the penguin exhibit, we also had visits to our dinner tables by an owl and a falcon. Combine that with family and friends coming together to celebrate these women&mdash;live events don&rsquo;t get much better than that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We knew we had to postpone it. At first we thought we could schedule it for June, but quickly realized even that would be too soon. Now, we hope we can have the event safely at the Aviary on October 8th but know that it may not be possible to have a live event at all this year. Later this summer, if we determine we can still have the event live, we&rsquo;ll be sure to let everyone know and make tickets available for purchase. If instead we have to host a virtual event, we&rsquo;ll do so with enthusiasm and hope that you can join us in safely honoring these women, in whatever way we can.</p>

<p>The Women in Conservation event is a fundraising event for PennFuture. The funds it brings in from our generous sponsors and from tickets sales provide unrestricted support for our environmental watchdog work. Not having the event makes it more difficult for us to do this work.</p>

<p>Most of PennFuture&rsquo;s funds come from grants which are restricted to very specific projects which are planned out months, if not years, in advance. Unrestricted funds from events and from individual donors allow us to have the flexibility we need to respond to environmental threats in real time. For example, if not for the generosity of a handful of concerned donors this spring, we would not have been able to quickly organize the March rally against HB1100 and create the successful publicity campaign around it. Unrestricted dollars make a difference.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I want to give a special shout out to the corporate sponsors of the 2020 Women in Conservation Dinner who have stayed with us in their support during these difficult times. Thank you to NextEra Energy Resources, Signature Financial, MaherDuessel, and CLA (CliftonLarsonAllen)! If you are affiliated with a company that is interested in joining them in sponsoring the 2020 Women in Conservation Awards, please let us know.</p>

<p>Though it has been difficult for us, and all charities, to change and postpone our fundraising events, there has been some good news this spring for the nonprofit world. <strong>The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provides three new incentives for donors to contribute to their favorite charities this year:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>There is now a $300 above-the-line ($600 for couples!) charitable income tax deduction. What this means is that if you make a donation in 2020, and don&rsquo;t itemize on your 2020 taxes, then you can now give $300 to charity and get a full $300 tax break in addition to the standard deduction. That&rsquo;s right, your donation today is 100% deductible. There&rsquo;s never been an incentive like this before to give to the causes you care about!</li>
	<li>If you do itemize, then there is a benefit for you too! The new law allows for cash contributions to qualified charities such as PennFuture to be deducted up to 100% of your adjusted gross income for 2020. Ordinarily, the income tax charitable deduction for cash gifts is limited to 60% of your income. This 100% limit allows you to reduce your 2020 federal income tax to zero. Your charitable deductions in 2020 cannot exceed 100% of your income, but you may be able to carry unused charitable deductions forward to future years. Please check with your financial advisors to determine whether the 100% deduction makes sense for your specific circumstances.</li>
	<li>IRA donations:&nbsp; For 2020, there will be no mandatory distributions from retirement accounts (whatever the age of the owner), thus allowing those accounts to recover. The minimum age for making a tax-free transfer from an IRA to a charity remains at 70&frac12;, and the annual limit remains at $100,000. However, since cash gifts are deductible in 2020 to the extent of adjusted gross income (100%), a person could withdraw and then contribute a larger amount&mdash;with the deduction offsetting the taxable withdrawal. Again, please check with your financial advisor regarding this.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>We know that right now making a charitable donation may be the last thing on your mind, and perhaps something not even possible to consider. The pandemic has created unfortunate and worrisome economic conditions. If you or your family have been adversely impacted by workplace closures or furloughs, you have our deepest sympathies. We are thinking of you and hope to hear from you when things get better.</p>

<p>However, if you are in a position to make a donation to PennFuture, or to any other charity you care about this year, then because of the CARES Act it may be one of the most economically advantageous times to do so. Think of it as a stimulus donation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are difficult, unprecedented, and unpredictable times we are living in. Nothing can be done as it was before. Before we do anything we now first think &ldquo;how can I do this safely?&rdquo; And if we can&rsquo;t do it safely then how do we &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; and change our expectations so that we can be safe? It requires determination and flexibility to stay successful. And it requires trust and hope to make it worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture is determined to be your environmental watchdog regardless of the challenging circumstances, and we are very grateful for the trust you have given us to support this work.&nbsp;<br />
We hope to see you at the National Aviary in October to celebrate the 2020 Women in Conservation honorees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stay safe!</p>

Pennsylvania Legislators Send Deregulatory Bill to Wolf’s Desk,5/15/2020,"<p>What was for the most part a quiet week in Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania State Senate and House of Representatives met for a few days to continue to move a suite of bills to reopen different sectors of businesses and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy. Both chambers also continued to move code bills preparing for the state&rsquo;s budget season, in earnest, with the House moving nine appropriations bills for varying boards, commissions, and agencies.</p>

<p>Equally concerning is that the legislative leadership at the State Capitol is still using the cover of the COVID-19 public health crisis to move deregulatory bills. Instead of increasing protections for Pennsylvanians, members of the General Assembly used this opportunity to approve blocking numerous environmental regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On May 13, the State Senate met to amend and move Senate Bill 327 out of the Senate Rules Committee and push a concurrence vote before the entire Senate before heading back to the House. The bill received a party-line vote with a few members pushing back against the provision blocking regulations.</p>

<p>SB 327 seeks to undermine the regulatory authority of our agencies&mdash;environmental and other&mdash;that are tasked with safeguarding Pennsylvanians&rsquo; public health. This legislation would stop any proposed or final-form environmental regulation from being finalized until at least 90 days after the March 6th COVID-19 emergency declaration by the Governor is terminated. Specifically, this could drastically impact the ability for state agencies to continue their work protecting Pennsylvanians. This bill jettisons Pennsylvanians&rsquo; rights to environmental protection for what could be many months, and this is simply unacceptable.</p>

<p>Further, SB 327 moves to unnecessarily lengthen the regulatory review process and could delay implementation of regulations that are critical to keeping us safe. It is irresponsible to indefinitely abandon work that aims to keep our air and water clean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This bill would affect: a proposed regulation setting water quality standards for harmful neurotoxin manganese; a proposed regulation establishing cleanup standards for PFAS water contamination; a final regulation to reduce deaths related to air pollution by reducing sulfur in heating oil; a proposed regulation redesignating the water quality protection for over 40 streams; a proposed carbon dioxide reduction program, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The legislation puts in jeopardy hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government that aids in our state regulatory agencies&rsquo; ability to do their jobs. SB 327 may very well cause our Commonwealth to abdicate primacy and its own administration of federal programs and could result in the federal government taking over these programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankfully, Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny) spoke up in defense against SB 327. He made the case that this legislation would impact &ldquo;many regulations proposed by our agencies&hellip;[which] now will be tolled or stopped. Some of the most important regulations are environmental ones...we need to proceed with them.&rdquo; Leader Costa continued to advocate for moving these critical protections forward, getting public comment, and advancing the process for Pennsylvania to link its carbon emissions reduction program to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which would bring millions of dollars in proceeds to the Commonwealth that could be used for clean air projects and be reinvested in our workers, infrastructure, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We thank Senator Costa for his comments supporting transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Due to the blocking of regulations in SB 327, Costa argued, &ldquo;this bill is inappropriate to move forward at this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On May 14th, in a surprise voting session that was called by Speaker Turzai the evening prior, the House leadership called up Senate Bill 327 for concurrence&mdash;the final vote in the House chamber before being sent to the Governor for his consideration. After robust debate and defense from environmental champions in the Legislature, SB 327 was approved by the House by a largely party-line vote (108-94). We appreciate Representative Todd Stephens (R-Montgomery) who joined the House Democratic caucus in opposing this bill in the final vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rep. Kevin Boyle (D-Montgomery/Philadelphia) rose to speak against SB 327 during the floor debate and said that the bill was troubling and he urged a &lsquo;no&rsquo; vote because it &ldquo;suspends all new regulations during the entire duration of the emergency COVID-19 declaration.&rdquo; He continued to share that, &ldquo;Harvard University said that our current emergency could last until 2022&hellip;[Boyle] couldn&rsquo;t help but think [SB 327] was more about a deregulatory agenda instead of COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We also appreciate the salient remarks from House Environmental Resources Minority Chair Rep. Greg Vitali (D-Delaware) and House Minority Leader Frank Dermody (D-Allegheny) who posited that SB 327 would cause &ldquo;huge problems for the environment and will cost the Commonwealth millions of dollars in funding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before calling for a final vote to move the bill to Governor Wolf, House Majority Leader Rep. Bryan Cutler (R-Lancaster) made the troubling comment that &ldquo;if the Governor can suspend our economy, we can suspend regulations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are thankful that Governor Wolf has already committed to vetoing Senate Bill 327 when he receives the legislation and we are grateful for those in Harrisburg who continue to fight&mdash;even during this pandemic&mdash;against all the attacks on our protections and funding to keep our air and water clean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We continue to work as your watchdogs in the halls of Harrisburg and take that duty seriously.</p>

It’s Time to Move the RGGI Rulemaking Process Forward,5/14/2020,"<p>It&rsquo;s been a little over seven months since Governor Tom Wolf&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/executive-order-2019-07-commonwealth-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change-through-electric-sector-emissions-reductions/"">Executive Order 2019-07</a> which instructed the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to develop a cap-and-invest program to control carbon pollution from power plants in Pennsylvania that aligns with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).</p>

<p>The concept of this rule is simple. Instead of letting power plants dump carbon pollution in our air for free, they will have to pay a price that is determined through an auction.&nbsp;Not only will that encourage more innovation in reducing emissions, but the money can be re-invested to further reduce air pollution.&nbsp;This has been very successful with the rest of the 10&nbsp;RGGI states seeing benefits of <a href=""https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">$1.4 billion in net economic benefits</a> from 2015 to 2017.</p>

<p>Having to pay to pollute isn&rsquo;t popular with polluters, and their friends began the attacks right away.&nbsp;The chronically ill-informed Rep. Metcalfe (R-Butler) went so far as to declare that the Governor&rsquo;s plan was illegal on the very day of the Executive Order&mdash;well before the actual plan was even written.&nbsp;Since then, the opposition has put a little more effort in their talking points, but the level of misinformation is still pretty high.</p>

<p>One common line of attack has been that the DEP is developing this program without the &ldquo;robust public outreach&rdquo; the governor promised&mdash;this couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth.&nbsp;As a member of <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Air/BAQ/AdvisoryGroups/Air-Quality-Technical-Advisory-Committee/Pages/default.aspx"">DEP&rsquo;s Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee</a> (AQTAC) I&rsquo;ve had a front row seat as the first drafts of the regulatory language were developed,&nbsp;but our meetings are always open to the public and always invite public comment either in person or in writing.&nbsp;More importantly, DEP has listened to the comments and responded by both making changes to their proposal and releasing more detailed information.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s true DEP hasn&rsquo;t adopted every suggestion (<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-DEP-is-Asking-Us-to-Pick-Up-the-Bill-for-Waste-CoalAgain"">mine included</a>), but they are still in the early stages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Developing a regulation in Pennsylvania is a slow process guided by a law known as the Regulatory Review Act, <a href=""http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/resources/docs/Regulatory_Review_Process_Manual.PDF"">detailed in a 48 page manual</a> for those who want to dig deeper.&nbsp;This requires a formal public comment period and review by the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, the Legislature, and the Attorney General among other steps.&nbsp;When this is pointed out, opponents fall back on their second claim that this is just the &ldquo;bare minimum&rdquo; and therefore still not &ldquo;robust&rdquo; enough.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course that is also a lie.&nbsp;The law doesn&rsquo;t require that DEP go through the AQTAC review process, by doing that alone they are already doing more than the minimum. In fact, while some have raised concerns that COVID-19 would make transparency in regulatory development more difficult, virtual meetings are turning out to be a success.&nbsp;At its peak, our last AQTAC meeting had more than 200 attendees&mdash;far more than the capacity of our normal meeting room.</p>

<p>Public participation is a very important part of any rulemaking process. There are certainly voices that need to be heard and concerns that must be addressed to make sure the final rule is the best it can be, but I can say with confidence that the corporate complainers aren&rsquo;t interested in a better rule.&nbsp;They want to kill this rulemaking process by whatever means necessary and saying outreach hasn&rsquo;t been robust enough is nothing more than a convenient soundbite. How do we know this is true? The same people who are doing the complaining are also trying to stop the DEP&#39;s rulemaking process before the formal public comment period even starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next week, on May 19th, the DEP <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/CitizensAdvisoryCouncil/Meetings/Pages/default.aspx"">is going to make a presentation</a> to the Citizens Advisory Council (CAC) and ask them to recommend that the package be sent to the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) for consideration.&nbsp;If approved by the EQB, the DEP will then open the formal public comment period and start the public participation process in earnest.</p>

<p>The opposition are sure to make their voices heard at the meeting. They may complain about the lack of outreach, but that&rsquo;s just a cover for their real ask of a gift for polluters.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s important that the people be heard as well, and that is what CAC should recommend.&nbsp;Unfortunately, that isn&rsquo;t a sure thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are enough representatives on CAC tied to polluting interests that the &ldquo;Citizens&rdquo; Advisory Council could actually recommend not moving forward with the public comment period and, therefore, not giving any other citizens a voice in the matter. We need to let them know that opening a public comment period on the rule is the right thing to do.&nbsp;If you want your voice heard at the meeting, you can contact Keith Salador at ksalador@pa.gov or (717) 787-8171 to get on the list to testify.</p>

The Colors of a Pandemic,5/13/2020,"<p>I&rsquo;m writing this from southern Luzerne County, where I&rsquo;ve been working since March 16 when the whole of PennFuture&rsquo;s team went to a work-from-home policy to help us safely ride out this phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am grateful for those elected officials, community volunteers, and every frontline worker who is playing a part to help us weather this horrendous virus that has upended our communities, country and the world. I wish safety and good health to all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pain of loss and disruption caused by this virus is felt everywhere. But our Earth is breathing again, even as human lungs are under viral attack. The air is notably cleaner, lost hues are making it back into our sunrises and sunsets. The blue of our skies is amplified and crystal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wildlife is liberated as people hunker down. Songbirds are back and occupying new locales made quieter from the lack of traffic. They can hear each other sing to prospective mates, no longer drowned out by motors and jake brakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>All that seems to be coming to an end. The people of the United States have found a way to let an insidious and indiscriminate killer like COVID-19 fracture us even further. The red, white and blue of the American flag has not emerged as the true colors of this national emergency as it did after the September 11, 2001 attacks. We&rsquo;ve not found a unity symbol of &ldquo;alone but together,&rdquo; at least not in my community.</p>

<p>Three weeks ago, we marked the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day, which was April 22, 1970.&nbsp;From the people&rsquo;s struggles against the Vietnam War, racism and poverty, alarms went up around a growing ecological crisis:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The unsustainable expansion of humans into all corners of, and habitats on, planet Earth;</li>
	<li>Pollution-induced profits increasingly lording over the welfare of the people; and</li>
	<li>Poisoning of our air, water and atmosphere.</li>
</ul>

<p>The emerging science and data of the COVID-19 pandemic is telling us that our inability to address the ecological and social issues of the last 50 years is driving the worst attributes of this virus&rsquo; origins and helping define many of its victims&mdash;the black, the brown, and the unhealthy, all made more vulnerable because of weaknesses in the natural systems that sustain life, most notably the air we breathe, the quality of the places we live and the kind of food we eat. And the virus is illuminating the weaknesses in the economic drivers in which we&rsquo;ve invested for decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We expect a different normal going forward. We understand that how we generate income, socialize, educate, recreate and coexist as communities will change and must change given the extent to which the past bad decisions and poor investments made, and &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve elected have gotten us to this moment in time. We must not fail in re-shaping these basic aspects of our future, having been given an unforeseen opportunity in the form of a horrible pandemic that is crushing every normal we know.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We must reinvent our society through the lens of equality and sustainability. But Pennsylvania has many Achilles Heels in regard to our ability to re-create a future where authentic resiliency of our economy, our environment and our people takes the lead. We have opposition here to livable wages; we have unions that are resistant to change, entrenched in old industries and mindsets; we have centuries of reliance on fossil fuel industries that have created jobs at the expense of workers&rsquo; health and the environment; diverse voices are suppressed in our civic systems and disparate viewpoints are suppressed in deliberative government bodies; and now, we have politicized a pandemic making bridging these dynamics&mdash;and so many others&mdash;an even&nbsp; harder undertaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But we have an unprecedented opportunity before us and cannot be deterred by these unflattering attributes of our state: The federal government has the capacity and power to create stimulus funding and programs that must salvage our tattered small businesses; create commensurate employment opportunities for workers and sectors where job loss is projected to be permanent or semi-permanent; and create jobs and training for the hardest hit, including our 2020 high school and college graduates and less skilled individuals. We must make a just and progressive mark on these funds and programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture has an important perspective to bring to the stimulus and recovery discussions, in the form of ideas for programs, projects and funding that can drive a rebuilding of our state centered on sustainability and equity. We will be sharing that soon.</p>

<p>The other opportunity is that we are in an election year, and it is critical that every eligible voter exercises their right to vote. Please vote for individuals who have articulated an unambiguous commitment to a very, very different future for Pennsylvania and our country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Senator Gaylord Nelson&mdash;the father of Earth Day&mdash;called for &quot;a new national coalition whose objective is to put quality for human life on a par with Gross National Product.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plainly said and still direly needed today. Let&rsquo;s activate and do our parts to ensure that our recovery leads to a green future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get it right this time around, beginning with our home state of Pennsylvania.</p>

PennFuture Releases Updated Stream Redesignation Handbook: A Step-by-Step Guide for Local Stream Protection Efforts,5/11/2020,"<p>Across the state, local conservation and watershed groups are recognizing the superior water quality of their streams and are engaging in the process to upgrade stream protections. To support these grassroots efforts, PennFuture has released an updated version of our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PF_StreamHandbook2019_web_2.10.20.pdf"">Stream Redesignation Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>This 82-page manual serves as a guide for those looking to protect and maintain local stream quality by walking through the various steps of the official regulatory process, explaining the information needed for the petition, and recommending ways to garner support for the redesignation petition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This can be a complicated process, so let&rsquo;s first take some time to explain the terminology and processes of state regulations currently in place.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is blessed with more than 86,000 miles of streams, and the quality of these waters is protected through Pennsylvania&rsquo;s water quality standards, which include a &ldquo;designated use&rdquo; for each and every surface water.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uses&rdquo; include classifications like aquatic life, recreation, and special protection waters.</p>

<p>Fewer than 5 percent of our waters, however, are designated as special protection waters<span mso-fareast-language:="""" mso-fareast-theme-font:="""" new="""" style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"" times="""">&mdash;</span>either High Quality (HQ) or Exceptional Value (EV)<span mso-fareast-language:="""" mso-fareast-theme-font:="""" new="""" style=""font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"" times="""">&mdash;</span>which recognizes the most outstanding water quality in the state and confers the strongest protections. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Designated uses can be thought of as water quality goals of the state, and in some cases, they do not reflect the actual better water quality of a stream or stream segment. In those cases, it is appropriate to petition the PA Department of Environmental Protection to &ldquo;redesignate,&rdquo; or upgrade, the designated use of the stream so that more stringent protections will be in place to protect and maintain the better water quality. Check out Our Pocono Waters&rsquo; webinar <a href=""https://youtu.be/DBWr4aFUvgM"">&ldquo;Intro to Clean Streams Regulations in PA&rdquo;</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Our newly revised Stream Redesignation Handbook is the definitive guide for wading through the redesignation process in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In addition to promoting strong water quality regulations, PennFuture also monitors and opposes any efforts to undermine clean water protections, and so our Handbook also provides guidance on how to fight proposed rollbacks of designated use protections</p>

<p>Our state&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection should be swiftly acting on opportunities to upgrade the quality of our streams, expanding healthy fisheries, and areas where we can safely enjoy a summer swim. Successful efforts to increase stream protections include the redesignation of lower French Creek and Beaver Run in Chester County and Swiftwater Creek in Monroe County from HQ to EV.</p>

<p>Finally, these designations are not barriers to development. Antidegradation regulations still allow activities to be permitted in both HQ and EV watersheds, provided the discharges protect existing water quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, developments approved in the upper French Creek watershed following EV designation include the French Creek Golf Course Community in Warwick and East &amp; West Nantmeal Townships, as well as the Weatherstone development by Hankin Group in West Vincent Township. And in Monroe County, Kalahari Resort &amp; Conventions was built and the Poconos Springs Entertainment Village is being proposed along the banks of the EV Swiftwater Creek.</p>

<p>Upgrading stream protections is important to our environment and also our communities and local economies.&nbsp;The process to upgrade stream designations in Pennsylvania does not have to be confusing or overwhelming with PennFuture&rsquo;s Stream Redesignation Handbook as a guide.</p>

U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Attempts to Restrict the Clean Water Act’s Protections For Discharges Through Groundwater,5/7/2020,"<p>Last month, the Supreme Court of the United States issued arguably <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-260_5i36.pdf"">its most important Clean Water Act decision</a> in the past decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issue in the case of <em>County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund</em> was whether the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) requires a permit when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters by a nonpoint source, which in this case is&nbsp;groundwater.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ultimately held that a permit is required if the addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the &ldquo;functional equivalent&rdquo; of a direct discharge from the point source into navigable waters. While issuing no bright-line rule, the Supreme Court identified several factors for courts to consider when applying this functional equivalent standard in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is much to unpack in this decision, so a quick overview of the CWA requirements and definitions is helpful.</p>

<p>Section 301 of the CWA requires a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for the discharge of any pollutant from a point source into a waterbody.</p>

<ul>
	<li>&ldquo;Pollutant&rdquo; is defined by the CWA to include things like solid waste, heat, sewage, chemical wastes, and biological wastes.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Point source&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance...from which pollutants are or may be discharged,&rdquo; including for example, any &ldquo;container,&rdquo; &ldquo;pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, or conduit,&rdquo; or &ldquo;well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Discharge of a pollutant&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters [including the territorial seas] from any point source.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>And while there&rsquo;s been much controversy lately over the Trump Administration&rsquo;s limiting of the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States,&rdquo; there is no argument that groundwater is not covered by the CWA. Rather, Congress left primary responsibility for groundwater protections to the individual states. For example, in Pennsylvania, our Clean Streams law explicitly includes groundwater in the definition of &ldquo;waters of the Commonwealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So back to Maui. In 2012, several environmental groups filed a CWA citizen suit in federal district court arguing that the County of Maui&rsquo;s wastewater reclamation facility&rsquo;s four underground injection wells used to dispose of treated wastewater required an NPDES permit since the injected effluent travels through the groundwater which flows into the Pacific Ocean. The district court agreed with the environmental groups, and the County of Maui appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>While the Ninth Circuit upheld the lower court&rsquo;s decision in 2018, it set forth a different standard than the district court as to why the indirect discharge (i.e., through groundwater) of a pollutant requires a NPDES permit in this case: a permit is required because &ldquo;pollutants are fairly traceable from the point source to a navigable water such that the discharge is the functional equivalent of a discharge into the navigable water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court agreed to hear the County of Maui&rsquo;s appeal of the Ninth Circuit decision. You can read about our former Senior Attorney Alice Baker&rsquo;s trip to the Supreme Court to hear the oral argument in the Maui case <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-A-Trip-to-the-Supreme-Court"">by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court focused on the word &ldquo;from&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;discharge of a pollutant,&quot; which led to some <a href=""https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/18-260"">interesting examples of spiking the punch</a> during oral argument.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the environmental groups argued that the Ninth Circuit standard is correct with the addition that the point source must be a &ldquo;proximate cause of the addition of pollutants to navigable waters.&rdquo; On the other hand, the County of Maui and the Trump Administration (an amicus curiae in the case) argued the very extreme opposite that basically the groundwater cuts off any liability under the CWA.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court rejected both of these standards as either resulting in requiring permitting in &ldquo;surprising, even bizarre circumstances&rdquo; or creating &ldquo;such a large and obvious loophole&rdquo; in the CWA&rsquo;s permitting structure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, the Supreme Court held that the CWA requires a NPDES permit when an indirect discharge of pollutants into navigable waters is the &ldquo;functional equivalent of a direct discharge,&rdquo; that is, when a discharge from a point source &ldquo;reaches the same result through roughly similar means.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In coming to this standard, the Court recognizes the natural limits imposed by the CWA&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;from&rdquo; as it relates to the need for a &ldquo;point source&rdquo; and identifies some bookends to its test (e.g., a few feet of groundwater versus 50 miles). But the Court also recognizes that they have offered no bright-line test and instead offered seven factors to consider for the &ldquo;middle instances&rdquo; between the bookends:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Transit time</li>
	<li>Distance traveled,</li>
	<li>The nature of the material through which the pollutant travels,</li>
	<li>The extent to which the pollutant is diluted or chemically changed as it travels,</li>
	<li>The amount of pollutant entering the navigable waters relative to the amount of the pollutant that leaves the point source,</li>
	<li>The manner by or area in which the pollutant enters the navigable waters, and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The degree to which the pollution (at that point) has maintained its specific identity.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Court states clearly that &ldquo;[t]ime and distance will be the most important factors in most cases, but not necessarily every case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision also seems to balance several policy considerations in developing this new standard for review, including the preservation of states&rsquo; primary authority to regulate groundwater, the CWA&rsquo;s inclusion of wells in its definition of point source, the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) longstanding practice of permitting groundwater discharges in some circumstances, and <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/npdes/interpretative-statement-releases-pollutants-point-sources-groundwater"">EPA&rsquo;s 2019 Interpretive Statement</a> on permitting requirements from groundwater.</p>

<p>The decision concluded with some additional guidance for lower courts since the Court is the first to admit that administration of its functional equivalent test may not be easy: as lower courts hear similar cases and may refine the principles set forth in Maui, such decisions must neither undermine state regulation of groundwater nor create loopholes that undermine the CWA&rsquo;s basic federal regulatory objectives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Maui case will go back to the Ninth Circuit to reconsider the case in light of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s new &ldquo;functional equivalent&rdquo; standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For now, however, I think that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s rejection of the extreme positions taken by the County of Maui and the Trump Administration is something to be celebrated.&nbsp; With the almost constant attack from the Administration on our bedrock environmental laws, this is just the boost that environmental groups&ndash;and the health of our Nation&rsquo;s waters&ndash;needed. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Clean Streams Law is strong, but a strong federal Clean Water Act is also needed to ensure the health of over 80,000 miles of streams in the Commonwealth.</p>

"PA House Leaders Push Bills to Thwart Environmental Protections, Attack Conservation Funding",5/5/2020,"<p>Anti-environmental legislators in the Pennsylvania General Assembly are using the COVID-19 public health crisis as a cover to move bills to block any proposed or final environmental regulations and to attack dedicated environmental and conservation funds.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen more than a dozen attempts just this legislative session to repeal and roll back critical protections, but now leadership in the House of Representatives is quickly moving&nbsp; two dangerous bills to halt critical environmental regulations that were in the works before the pandemic began.</p>

<p>On April 17, House State Government Committee Chair Garth Everett (R-Lycoming) introduced House Bill 2416, and on April 20, the committee approved the bill on party-line vote.</p>

<p>HB 2416 would stop any proposed or final environmental or other state agency regulation from being finalized until at least 90 days after the March 6th COVID-19 emergency declaration by the Governor is terminated. Everett&rsquo;s bill seems to fit the &ldquo;demands&rdquo; made by House Environmental Resources and Energy Chairman Daryl Metcalfe that the Department of Environmental Protection suspend or roll back environmental regulations during the ongoing pandemic. You can read more about <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/thebark2"">PennFuture&rsquo;s comments on this letter here.</a></p>

<p>The legislation also stipulates that no proposed regulation may be submitted in final form to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) or the House and Senate committees. The bill allows state agencies to petition appropriate standing committees of the Senate and House&mdash;solely controlled by House leadership&mdash;for a waiver from the prohibition against publishing regulations. Additionally, the bill blocks final regulations from being promulgated as regulations by the Department of Environmental Protection or any other agency.</p>

<p>HB 2416 provides no requirement for the committees to take any action on the request. This legislation seemingly raises noteworthy issues with the Pennsylvania Constitution, because the bill allows for indefinite tolling of regulations without employing the regular legislative process and other deliberative bodies such as the opposite chamber and the Governor&rsquo;s approval.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This legislation would have real implications on several protections and regulatory actions in the proposed or final forms of rulemaking including: increasing fees for unconventional oil and gas well permits, setting air emissions standards for oil and gas operations (such as volatile organic compounds and methane), establishing standards for cleaning up PFOS and PFOA contamination, redesignation for water quality protection for dozens of streams, and setting up a carbon dioxide reduction program, among others.</p>

<p>PennFuture and partners fought back against HB 2416 and was successful in blocking the bill from receiving third consideration and final passage votes last week, though it may come back as the House continues its legislative session. SB 327, an administrative code bill setting up a COVID-19 response task force, was amended two weeks ago to include a provision with regulatory tolling language identical to HB 2416. We&rsquo;ll continue to push back against both anti-regulatory bills in the House and Senate. HB 2416 remains on the House calendar and SB 327 is currently awaiting action in the Senate Rules Committee.</p>

<p>With the rapid action of these fast-tracked administrative code bills, PennFuture will remain vigilant and we call on members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly to oppose both House Bill 2416 and Senate Bill 327.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, those aren&rsquo;t the only bad bills we&rsquo;re watching in Harrisburg.</p>

<p>On April 21st, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives&rsquo; leadership took a bill&mdash;House Bill 1822&mdash;meant for giving small municipalities low-interest loans and financial support for COVID-19 response hostage and added a dangerous amendment that would freeze new expenditures for sixteen special funds, including eight funds related to conservation and the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few of those eight funds include the Environmental Stewardship Fund (Growing Greener), the Keystone Recreation, Park, and Conservation Fund, the Recycling Fund, and the County Conservation District Fund.The Pennsylvania House adopted this amendment from House Appropriations Chair Stan Saylor (R-York) and sent it to the Senate for its consideration, where it remains in the Senate Rules Committee.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more: on the morning of May 5, the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, chaired by Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R-Butler), held a voting meeting in Harrisburg to approve another attack on environmental and conservation funding, via House Bill 2004, sponsored by Rep. Jason Ortitay (R-Allegheny/Washington).</p>

<p>This legislation seeks to take control of allocating money in key environmental and conservation funds, such as Keystone Recreation, Parks, and Conservation Fund, from the executive branch agencies to the General Assembly. After Rep. Ortitay mentioned that the Keystone Fund should be opened to compete against other funding priorities, it&rsquo;s evident that legislators in Harrisburg are using this abnormal budget season as an opportunity to put a wildly popular thirty-year-old program at risk. What&rsquo;s being called a measure to &lsquo;tighten the belt&rsquo; of the Commonwealth is nothing more than an austerity measure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We wholly reject this frame. Our natural resources are necessary and conservation, protection, maintenance of these are a core function of our government. We appreciate Minority Chairman Vitali&rsquo;s (D-Delaware/Montgomery) leadership against this bill in committee along with the steadfast advocacy from Reps. Leanne Krueger (D-Delaware) and Rep. Mary Isaacson (D-Philadelphia).</p>

<p>Rep. Krueger rightfully reminded her colleagues that, being in the middle of a pandemic, timing on moving HB 2004 was questionable. She made the case that the bill would significantly change how Pennsylvania funds our parks, trails, ballparks, and more. Rep. Krueger added that the Keystone Fund has worked for thirty years and now the legislature wants to put it in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Rep. Isaacson admonished the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee members, saying that the legislature needs to be careful: &ldquo;this is a restricted fund...this was created to protect treasures in our state that are for everyone. This fund is not to be subject to the will and whims of this General Assembly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For more information on highlighted projects funded by the Environmental Stewardship Fund (Growing Greener) and the Keystone Fund, please visit: <a href=""https://esfund.info/"">https://esfund.info/</a> and <a href=""https://keystonefund.org/"">https://keystonefund.org/</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unacceptable that these critical funds are being used as bargaining chips during this budget season and PennFuture wholly opposes HBs 1822 and 2004, which are nothing more than attacks on our clean air and water. Proponents of these bills are using libraries, historic preservation, recreation, conservation, and our state parks and forests as pawns - chess pieces for leverage in the budget fight, and as made clear by Chairman Daryl Metcalfe today, movement of these bills is tied to opposition to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s COVID-19 stay-at-home orders.</p>

Thirty Days of Action,5/4/2020,"<p>Sometimes, your best-laid plans evaporate in an instant and you&rsquo;re forced to improvise on the fly. So it was for the entire month of April, a time that was supposed to be spent outside with friends, family and colleagues celebrating the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such a momentous occasion should have been marked with rallies, parades and parties. Instead, with the COVID-19 pandemic gripping the world, we were all forced indoors in front of our computer screens, wondering what to do next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, we improvised.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The result was a fantastic initiative between PennFuture and our partners at <a href=""https://www.conservationpa.org/"">Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania</a>. Called the Act For Our Earth Challenge, participants who signed up for the challenge received one meaningful action in their inbox for each day in April. Most actions only took ten minutes or less, while more involved actions included educational webinars or films.</p>

<p>The challenge was a great success. Over 700 people signed up for the challenge engaging in over 20,000 actions. Throughout the month we aimed to offer a variety of actions in order to find something for everyone. They can broadly be classified as advocacy, voting, education, lifestyle and movement building.</p>

<p><strong><u>Advocacy</u></strong></p>

<p>Both PennFuture and Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania strongly believe in empowering individuals to contact policymakers about why environmental protections are important to you. Some examples of these actions included:</p>

<p>Day 1 - Fight back against EPA rollbacks</p>

</ul>

<p><u><strong>Movement building</strong></u></p>

<p>In order to truly build a pro-environment society, we need to grow our movement by galvanizing people of diverse backgrounds.

Updated Climate Change Assessment Reveals Future Pennsylvania Water Troubles,4/30/2020,"<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection last week released the state&rsquo;s third <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Energy/Office of Energy and Technology/OETDPortalFiles/ClimateChange/2020ClimateChangeImpactsAssessmentUpdate.pdf"">Climate Change Impacts Assessment</a>, and the update tells us of a warmer future with more rain, floods and landslides than ever experienced in Pennsylvania history.</p>

<p>Heavier and more frequent storms will cause Pennsylvania rivers and streams to swell more frequently. Downstream, greater volumes of sediment will mix with farmland runoff and the pollution-filled stormwater of surrounding cities and towns, exacerbating water concerns for miles and miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The impacts will affect our local streams and be noticed far beyond Pennsylvania&rsquo;s borders. Left unchecked and unprepared, the climate crisis will further heighten the difficulty of cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>Challenges will be further intensified if regional agricultural trends continue. The assessment predicts a warmer Pennsylvania climate will attract greater investment in livestock farming across the state. In particular, poultry farming may double by 2050.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given the unpredictability of severe weather, we must do whatever we can to prepare&nbsp;now. This is no time to back down on long-term <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/what-is-green-stormwater-infrastructure"">investments in green stormwater infrastructure</a> and agricultural best management practices, as well as carbon-reduction policies such as <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fallacy-Fiction-and-Falsehoods-Debunking-RGGI-Myths-Part-1"">the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)</a>.</p>

<p>The dozens of Pennsylvania municipalities <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/PennFuture_StormwaterManual_web_3.20.17.pdf"">that collect stormwater fees</a> are already better prepared to fund improvements necessary to adapt to climate change and to meet the state&rsquo;s legal obligations under the federal Clean Water Act.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among those obligations, under <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl"">the EPA&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Program</a>, regional states agree to Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) pollution goals for across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Pennsylvania is committed to prevent 34 million pounds of nitrogen and 756,000 pounds of phosphorus.</p>

<p>To meet the Chesapeake Bay clean-up goals over the coming decades, the assessment anticipates that Pennsylvania will need to exceed annual nitrogen-reduction targets by another 4 million pounds.</p>

<p>Plus, if projected shifts in livestock production were to come true, think of the impact from all that animal manure. In Lancaster County, for example, nitrogen and phosphorous levels are projected to grow by 38% and 58%, respectively.</p>

<p>Not only do we need to better incentivize agricultural practices that lessen water pollution, such as riparian forested buffers and soil health, we must also react to how climate change will affect these practices. To date, research on how climate change will alter their effectiveness is, according to the assessment, &ldquo;essentially nonexistent for Pennsylvania&rdquo;</p>

<p>The release of this year&rsquo;s assessment update, amid the COVID-19 crisis, understandably may be lost amid the news cycle. Still, the warnings should not be overlooked. Even during a time of crisis, we must not lose vision of the challenges lying ahead if we fail to take climate action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As David Wallace-Wells <a href=""https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/the-coronavirus-is-a-preview-of-our-climate-change-future.html"">writes in New York Magazine</a>, &ldquo;The virus is a terrifying harbinger of future pandemics that will be brought about if climate change continues to so deeply destabilize the natural world: scrambling ecosystems, collapsing habitats, rewiring wildlife, and rewriting the rules that have governed all life on this planet for all of human history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, we need to stay focused.</p>

<p>Recent analysis finds that if the state were to follow Governor Tom Wolf&rsquo;s proposal and join RGGI, such action would allow Pennsylvania to <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Air/AirQuality/AQPortalFiles/Advisory Committees/Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee/2020/4-23-20/RGGI IPM Modeling Webinar.pdf"">reduce nearly 10 times the carbon emissions</a> than anticipated under current policies.</p>

<p>Despite that, leaders of the Pennsylvania Senate Republican Caucus are nonetheless <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2020/04/23/dep-projects-pa-could-cut-carbon-emissions-dramatically-as-part-of-cap-and-trade-effort/"">asking Wolf to rescind the order</a>, citing the pandemic as their excuse. In addition, certain factions within the General Assembly are in the process of trying to freeze funding that supports local parks, trails, environmental restoration projects, county conservation districts and other projects.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s emergencies do not justify creating more crises for future generations to bear. We must continue to work toward a stable climate. We must continue to prioritize clean water policies, and we must continue to fund programs and projects that protect our natural resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Otherwise, with the release of each impact assessment, we will find ourselves with less time to act and with diminished ability to avoid the worse to come.</p>

Fracked Gas and Petrochemical Industries Jockeying for Stimulus Recovery Funds,4/29/2020,"<p>In mid-April, the fracked gas and petrochemical industries&mdash;with the help of a contingent in the U.S. House of Representatives&mdash;<a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/04/22/natural-gas-companies-debt-loan-program-Fed-small-businesses-rate/stories/202004230017"">bombarded the U.S. Treasury Department</a> with letters begging the federal government for help paying back its loans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically, industry and its boosters want to use a program called the Main Street Lending Program&mdash;which is intended to provide a lifeline to small businesses struggling in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic&mdash;to pay back billions in debts accrued well before the current global health crisis unfolded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As it currently stands, the government is prohibiting businesses from using these special loans to pay off debt, but an intense lobbying effort by the industry could change that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why, in the midst of an economic collapse not seen since the Great Depression, would this industry try to repurpose loans that are needed to keep thousands of small businesses afloat?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because the industry knows it might collapse without them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The headlines have been eye-popping. One outlet predicted that <a href=""https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/3/27/experts-see-a-future-for-shale-rocks-don-t-go-bankrupt"">as many as 70 percent</a> of the 6,000 shale drillers in America may go bankrupt in the near future. In late April, the industry <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/negative-oil-prices-what-does-that-mean/"">hit an unprecedented rock bottom</a> as the price for futures contracts went below zero for the first time ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/energy-environment/pennsylvania-shale-gas-fracking.html"">the New York Times reported</a> in late March, some of the largest fracking companies in Pennsylvania&mdash;among them Range Resources, EQT and Southwestern Energy&mdash;have seen their stocks plummet and debts increase by a combined $7 billion since 2008.</p>

<p>Even Shell, the global behemoth that is building an ethane cracker plant in Beaver County, has seen its share prices drop by nearly half this year and <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lng-shell/shell-drops-out-of-major-u-s-lng-project-energy-transfer-delays-decision-idUSKBN21H2E9"">has stated its intent to pull out</a> of a major Liquified Natural gas project in Louisiana, citing market conditions.</p>

<p>The industry is facing more than $200 billion in corporate debt, and <a href=""https://www.ciel.org/news/pandemic-crisis-systemic-decline-new-report-warns-oil-gas-and-plastic-industries-are-an-unfillable-sinkhole-for-recovery-funds/"">one study published on April 16</a> warns of the dangers of dumping stimulus money into an industry that was already facing &ldquo;profound and pervasive risks&rdquo; before the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoveling money at the oil, gas, and petrochemical industries will not change the fundamental weaknesses they faced before this crisis began and will face moving forward,&rdquo; said report co-author Steven Feit.</p>

<p>That report makes clear an uncomfortable truth facing the industry: the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is accelerating its rapid decline, but it is not the sole cause or reason for the decline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exceedingly clear that this industry was on shaky financial footing even before the current pandemic upended our economy. Coronavirus isn&rsquo;t the culprit behind poor money management, declining revenues and inherent weaknesses that have plagued the industry. It wasn&rsquo;t a global public health crisis that made the financial sector deeply wary and skeptical of fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the chief executive officer of a Texas-based oil and gas exploration company <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/04/22/natural-gas-companies-debt-loan-program-Fed-small-businesses-rate/stories/202004230017"">who was quoted recently in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a> as saying &ldquo;no one wants to give (the industry) capital because we have all destroyed capital and created economic waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why, then, would the federal government&mdash;or any other government, financial institution, or other entity&mdash;be enticed to offer billions of dollars in bailouts to an industry that has consistently and routinely &ldquo;destroyed capital and created economic waste&rdquo; well before the current pandemic?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carroll Muffett, the president of CIEL&mdash;the organization <a href=""https://www.ciel.org/news/pandemic-crisis-systemic-decline-new-report-warns-oil-gas-and-plastic-industries-are-an-unfillable-sinkhole-for-recovery-funds/"">that published the study</a> warning against dumping stimulus money into this failing industry&mdash;said it best by adding that there&rsquo;s &ldquo;overwhelming evidence that this sector has reached its end game,&rdquo; and that it did so even before coronavirus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No amount of government intervention or taxpayer money can save these companies in the long term unless they fundamentally transform their business models. For governments to continue dumping money into these industries is throwing money down a hole at a time when every moment and every dollar needs to be used effectively for the greatest possible public good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For fossil fuels, the writing was sprawled across the wall well before current events took hold, and the industry should not try to parlay the coronavirus into an undeserved, irresponsible and reckless attempt at a bailout.</p>

PennFuture taking holistic view of improving water quality around Philadelphia,4/28/2020,"<p>Last week, the Delaware River <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Congratulations-to-the-Delaware-River"">was named the 2020 national &ldquo;River of the Year&rdquo;</a> by American Rivers. This honor recognizes the dramatic improvement of the Delaware River&rsquo;s water quality, which the organization credited to intergovernmental collaboration and effective environmental enforcement, coupled with innovative local water management.</p>

<p>Fish have returned to the urbanized portions of the river and the community is once again thinking of the lower Delaware River as a place of recreation!&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture is happy to be part of that push for better water quality over the past several decades, especially in the Philadelphia region of the Delaware River Watershed, where we&rsquo;ve been advocating for a variety of ways to improve the water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Category-KeepPhillyGreen"">Keep Philly Green &amp; Water Clean campaign</a> has been focusing on increasing green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) in the city. Philadelphia is increasing the use of GSI &ndash; such as rain gardens, tree trenches, and green roofs &ndash; through its Green City, Clean Waters program, which reduces the amount of polluted stormwater that enters the Delaware River and its tributaries through Philadelphia&rsquo;s combined sewer overflow (CSO) system. GSI has the added benefit of providing local communities with local jobs, cleaner air, more attractive parks, and streets, and an overall healthier community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2018, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Philadelphias-Green-City-Clean-Waters-Needs-Funding-to-Achieve-Goals"">PennFuture submitted comments</a> in support of Philadelphia&rsquo;s Green City, Clean Waters program in which we detailed the importance of funding and grant incentive programs to achieve Philadelphia&rsquo;s GSI plan. In 2019, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Opportunity-for-Green-Stormwater-Infrastructure-in-Philadelphias-Rebuild-Initiative"">we advocated for Philadelphia to combine</a> its GSI plan with the Rebuild Community Infrastructure (Rebuild) Initiative and petitioned the Philadelphia City Council to prioritize green stormwater infrastructure.</p>

<p>For the past two years in the fall, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Philly-GSI-Bus-tour"">PennFuture organized&nbsp;bus tours</a> with members of City Council aimed at highlighting the social, economic, and environmental benefits of GSI in Philadelphia. Earlier this month, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Philly-Can-Achieve-a-Green-New-Deal-through-Green-Stormwater-Infrastructure"">PennFuture advocated for a Green New Deal</a> for Philadelphia through an emphasis on GSI projects which create jobs, improve our local communities, and increase community resiliency against the impacts of climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture is a proud supporter of Green City, Clean Waters and the work that the Philadelphia Water Department does to increase GSI and address pollution into the Delaware River while improving Philadelphia&rsquo;s communities. A cleaner Delaware River means we can all enjoy its benefits &ndash; drinking, fishing, and recreating!&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why in March 2020, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Petitions-DRBC-to-Recognize-Primary-Contact-Recreation-on-the-Mainstem-Delaware-River"">PennFuture and others petitioned the Delaware River Basin Commission</a> to upgrade the designated use of a portion of the lower Delaware River to reflect the community&rsquo;s use of the River for primary contact recreation sports.</p>

<p>And in late April, PennFuture joined with our partner organizations to educate conservation groups and community members about our <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/3.2.2020-Primary-Contact-PR---Petition.pdf"">&ldquo;Petition for a Safe and Healthy Delaware River.&rdquo;</a> This petition asks for the Delaware River Basin Commission to recognize what American Rivers and others have: that the lower Delaware River has improved and that people are using it for swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, jet skiing, and other water sports that put community members in the river.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But now we need your support of our petition. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKiNCkEg_QcEEHqSBhUwbhQiJjgzaKQX5UhAramPQO7nE8aA/viewform"">Share your story of how you recreate</a> on the lower Delaware River. Sign on to our petition &ndash; <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccmsyRjHIRemMq24UQVqGwpL7IYz1s4NsfFXnqpz4F9yd1sw/viewform"">whether you&rsquo;re a conservation organization</a> or a <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/supportdelawarepetition"">concerned community member</a>. Your stories matter to the health of the Delaware!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We know that there are many different ways to protect water quality, and in the Philadelphia region, PennFuture has been utilizing many of our legal and advocacy tools to achieve a holistic vision for improvement of the water quality of the lower Delaware River watershed!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have fought hard to stop polluters and to find innovative ways to improve water quality of the Delaware River, and now we&rsquo;re advocating to protect the advances we&rsquo;ve made over the years.<br />

Model shows participation in RGGI would reduce pollution by 180 million tons,4/27/2020,"<p>On April 24, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) held a joint web conference to present <a href=""https://www.icf.com"">recent modeling completed by ICF</a> on the potential impact of Governor Wolf&rsquo;s plan to implement a cap-and-invest program in cooperation with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).</p>

<p>The results show the plan marks a significant step toward reaching our carbon pollution goals by saving 180 million tons of carbon pollution while maintaining Pennsylvania&#39;s status as a significant energy generator and exporter.</p>

<p>While this is great news on its own, ICF focused its modeling on the impacts of putting a cap on carbon admissions. The RGGI program also has an &ldquo;invest&rdquo; component where we can see even more benefits, but those weren&rsquo;t modeled. When Abt Associates <a href=""https://www.abtassociates.com/insights/publications/report/analysis-of-the-public-health-impacts-of-the-regional-greenhouse-gas"">looked into these broader impacts</a> seen in the other RGGI states they found it saved hundreds of lives, tens of thousands of hours of lost work, led to strong net job creation, and resulted in an overall total of $5.7 billion dollars in benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, no matter the benefits, you can&rsquo;t talk about reducing carbon pollution without generating attacks from polluters and their friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of their top-line arguments is that RGGI is going to kill coal. As we&rsquo;ve said before, coal generation in Pennsylvania is already on its last legs without RGGI&mdash;it went from 47 percent of our generation in 2010 to just 17 percent last year, and ICF predicts it will continue to drop to just 3 percent of our generation by 2030 even without RGGI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is not surprising since there are few remaining large coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania, all of them are rapidly approaching retirement, and no one is planning to build new plants. When RGGI is added to the mix, coal retirement speeds up a little bit to just over 1 percent of our generation by 2030. With RGGI making less than a 2 percent difference in overall coal generation, it&rsquo;s clear whatever problems the industry is facing, it is not RGGI that is killing coal.</p>

<p>The next line of attack is asserting that RGGI will raise prices. It&rsquo;s true that ICF&rsquo;s modeling shows a slight increase in energy prices by 1.1 tenths of a cent a kilowatt-hour over business-as-usual.&nbsp; While this works out to less than $1 per month on the average household bill, when adjusted for inflation energy prices are predicted to be lower with RGGI than they are today.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that there is a big difference between the price of energy and what consumers actually pay. If gas prices go up, people respond by driving less or buying a car with better gas mileage&mdash;the same thing happens with your electric bill. Consumers can invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy to reduce their bills. Better still, the fees generated by the RGGI program can go into programs that make those investments even cheaper, and this wasn&rsquo;t considered in the ICF modeling.</p>

<p>The last big attack comes in a lot of different forms, but it&rsquo;s that&nbsp; RGGI isn&rsquo;t going to fix the climate change crisis on its own, so it&rsquo;s not worth doing at all. Any elementary school student would probably realize that saying &ldquo;other people litter, so why not throw my trash out the window too?&rdquo; is a cop-out.</p>

<p>We all have a responsibility to act but Pennsylvania, as a huge source of the emissions that created the crisis, may have a greater responsibility than others to solve the problem. The investments and actions we take today will have long-lasting impacts well beyond 2030 and play a significant role in meeting our climate goals.</p>

<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us to avoid the worst effects of climate change we need to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. With electric generation being the largest source of carbon pollution in Pennsylvania, it&rsquo;s clear that we are not going to reach that goal, or even the lesser Paris goals, without doing all we can.</p>

<p>Failing to adopt the RGGI program means that we need to find a way to reduce 180 million extra tons of carbon pollution from some other source, and it&rsquo;s very likely that source isn&rsquo;t going to provide over a billion dollars in net benefits as we would see from RGGI.</p>

<p>These are not the last of the attacks we are going to see. Representatives from DEP did a great job at the briefing responding to these attacks, but as we go forward they are going to increase in frequency and intensity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be sure that PennFuture will be there every step of the way, pushing back against fallacies and mistruths, and doing what we can to keep you educated, informed and engaged with this long process.</p>

Earth Day 2070,4/21/2020,"<p>I truly believed this week, Earth Week, could be a magical one, when the world would come together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the first Earth Day.</p>

<p>Many months ago, when I began thinking about how we would be marking this momentous anniversary, I envisioned everything that happened in 1970 on behalf of &ldquo;Mother Earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;The decade of the anti-establishment 1960&rsquo;s actually peaked in 1970. Millions of people were in the streets in peaceful and turbulent protest; colleges students mounted teach-ins or occupied administration buildings; multiple generations were caught in the mod fashion of the day but they were also turned onto activism and issues. Earth Day 1970 and the &ldquo;ecology movement&rdquo; lead to a suite of sweeping legislation to protect our environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last summer, it seemed reasonable to think that on Earth Day 2020 in the midst of the existential climate crisis, the people of our earth would want to gather with even more urgency and turn out in bigger numbers than 1970 to change the condition of our planet&mdash;a planet besieged by anti-environmental policymakers, dark money billionaires and our own unsustainable lifestyles.&nbsp;Earth Day 2020 could be a catalyst to:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Energize the myriad of people across the globe who are experiencing climate impacts who care deeply about addressing the climate crisis, who want to do something about it but don&rsquo;t know how;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Give birth to a new environmental movement&mdash;one that reorients itself to not only climate matters, but to the concerns of so many diverse and underserved communities who are dealing also with impacts from chronic pollution and other forms of environmental degradation;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Raise up our youth climate strikers, and their courage and persistence; and</li>
	<li>Mobilize caring citizens everywhere into an unstoppable political force to once and for all change the politics, in order to change the fate of our common climate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can COVID-19 take this dream away? It sure has put a dent into the tactic of turning out great numbers of people, in public, demonstrating against climate inaction, demanding accountability of elected officials and celebrating climate solidarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But COVID-19 has not taken away our common humanity, interconnectedness, and reliance upon planetary health as foundational to our personal safety and well-being. If anything, this pandemic puts a finer point on these attributes. And, grimly, this public health emergency has deepened the disparities between underserved individuals and communities of color, and their ability to survive this deadly pandemic.</p>

<p>My hat is off to the organizations and activists everywhere that have quickly retooled plans for Earth Day 2020, including PennFuture and Conservation Voters of PA&rsquo;s 30-Day Earth Challenge, and the Pittsburgh Earth Week Teach-In and 24-hour Climate Strike.</p>

<p>And while digital platforms are uniting us, I propose three actions&mdash;more surgical in nature&mdash;to ensure this momentous Earth Day does not come and go with only a whimper or sound tone from our smart phone:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Run for Office. Nothing will change our political system faster than a new crop of climate-forward candidates. Once elected, you can effect real change. And the threat of an onslaught of challengers will threaten incumbent elected officials who have grown stagnant, entrenched in a broken system and to the influence of political action money;</li>
	<li>Vote. Make sure you are registered to vote, and that you actually vote. And make sure that everyone you know who is eligible to vote, is registered to vote, and that they actually vote. Here is everything you need to know about voting in Pennsylvania in 2020.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Contact your elected officials and demand they declare a climate emergency for their respective jurisdictions. Request they develop a climate change action and response plan.&nbsp; Contact Governor Wolf and request that funds for this local climate planning&mdash;and implementation of existing climate action plans and projects&mdash;are included in any stimulus or economic recovery package that emerges as a result of the pandemic.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Come with me to the date April 22, 2070&mdash;now the 100th anniversary of the first Earth Day.&nbsp;Will our Earth Week 2020 be one in which we found a way to rise up and break out, and break through the walls of our respective isolations, and despite the oppression of the pandemic, to find a way to recommit to the fight to save our planet, and our futures?</p>

Congratulations to the Delaware River!,4/20/2020,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">The resurgence of the Delaware River has received well-deserved recognition. Beating out river basins all across the United States, the Delaware was named River of the Year for 2020 by national environmental group American Rivers.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">With much of Eastern Pennsylvania flowing into the Delaware watershed, PennFuture takes seriously our charge as a clean water watchdog for the river. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Our legal team and community organizers defend the Delaware against illegal polluters and from efforts to undermine legal protections. As award-worthy as the Delaware is today, we take nothing for granted, continuously advocating for greater progress.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The source of drinking water for 13.3&nbsp;million people, the Delaware is now relied upon as a clean water resource. But, 50 years back, the water quality we enjoy today was nearly unimaginable. Polluters recklessly dumped raw sewage and chemicals straight into the river, making it near impossible to sustain even the most basic forms of aquatic life.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;The quality of water in the Delaware has dramatically improved, fish and wildlife have returned in tremendous numbers, and the mainstem of the Delaware remains the longest free-flowing river in the eastern U.S., with the most extensive National Wild and Scenic River protection of any watershed in the country,&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.americanrivers.org/2020/04/river-of-the-year-for-2020-the-delaware-river/"">writes American Rivers</a> VP of Communications Amy Souers Kober. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">American Rivers credits the revitalization to intergovernmental collaboration and effective environmental enforcement, coupled with innovative local water management. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">PennFuture is proud of the role our volunteers and campaign staff have played in leading these efforts. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">For example, PennFuture is a lead convener for groups such as <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.org/"">Our Pocono Waters</a>, a coalition of businesses and conservationists advocating for protection of the Exceptional Value headwaters of the Delaware. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Publication-PennFuture-and-Brodhead-Watershed-Association-Earn-Legal-Victory-for-Exceptional-Value-Streams-in-the-Poconos"">A recent campaign successfully thwarted</a> well-heeled owners of resorts and other large developments from weakening regional stream protections.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>PennFuture also holds the state lead seat for the Coalition of the Delaware River Watershed, a four-state coalition made up of over 150 members nongovernmental organizations. This coalition is dedicated to &ldquo;protecting and restoring the Delaware River, its tributaries, and more than 13,500 square miles of forests, wetlands, communities, and other distinctive landscapes in the Watershed, so that clean water and valued resources can be here for generations to come.&rdquo;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Last month, PennFuture attorneys <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Petitions-DRBC-to-Recognize-Primary-Contact-Recreation-on-the-Mainstem-Delaware-River"">co-led a draft petition to upgrade water quality standards for a portion of the Delaware River</a>. The petition demands regulators ensure the safety of all who engage in direct contact recreation &ndash; such as jet skiing and kayaking, swimming, stand-up paddleboarding and tubing. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In addition to advocacy work across the watershed, PennFuture keeps watch on individual polluters. Earlier this year, PennFuture placed two Philadelphia scrap metal facilities on notice for operating without necessary stormwater pollution controls. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">When scrap metal contacts with stormwater, pollutants such as motor oil, grease, lead, chromium, cadmium, copper, mercury and zinc may flow into the Delaware River. Our actions are deterring scrap yards and other industrial facilities who may otherwise operate with inadequate pollution control measures.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Let&rsquo;s continue to celebrate and protect the Delaware River. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Throughout the year, we will pair volunteers with their elected officials, educating leaders on the benefits of clean streams. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/ourpoconowaters/index.html"">Join us</a> to help ensure the steady flow of clean water progress. <o:p></o:p></p>

"PennFuture, partners to celebrate PA Clean Water Week",4/13/2020,"<p>The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has fundamentally changed most aspects of our lives in the last several months, but one thing that&rsquo;s changed for the positive is our connection to nature and the outdoors.</p>

<p>Here at PennFuture, we&rsquo;ve always taken seriously the need to appreciate Pennsylvania&rsquo;s natural resources, which is why we do everything we can to protect and preserve them. Part of that work, however, involves highlighting all of our beautiful streams, rivers and waterways throughout Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why this week, in conjunction with groups like the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed and the Choose Clean Water Coalition, we are officially celebrating the first ever &ldquo;PA Clean Water Week.&rdquo; During this period, we are celebrating not only the waters of Pennsylvania, but advocating for their preservation and health, and for funding from our state and federal governments for restoration and maintenance projects.</p>

<p>Each day this week, we will feature a different watershed in Pennsylvania and will use social media like Facebook and Twitter to communicate with supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday, April 13, we will celebrate the Delaware River watershed. On Tuesday, we will highlight the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which includes the Susquehanna &amp; Potomac Rivers. Wednesday will include a celebration of the Ohio River watershed, which includes the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers. Thursday will include a celebration of the Lake Erie and Genesee River watersheds. Friday will wrap up PA Clean Water Week with a virtual webinar to celebrate all of these wonderful watersheds!</p>

<p>Every day of the week, you can celebrate Pennsylvania&rsquo;s streams and rivers by sharing photos of your local waterways, posting a short video on why clean water matters to you, writing a poem or short story, or posting on social media. Please be sure to tag PennFuture on both Facebook and Twitter or use the hashtag #PaCleanWaterWeek, so we can share your contributions during the celebration webinar on Friday, April 17!</p>

Five Environmental Consequences of the Covid-19 Pandemic for Pennsylvania,4/8/2020,"<div>The environmental, economic, and social impacts of Covid-19 are profound and are reshaping how we work, recreate, and live our daily lives. While the impacts of this crisis will continue to shift and grow with each passing week, a number of critical environmental observations relevant to Pennsylvania are becoming clearer:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong>1. The importance of our outdoor and green spaces is vital now more than ever.</strong> Governor Tom Wolf issued a &ldquo;stay-at-home&rdquo; order to compel citizens across the Commonwealth to limit their daily interactions with others to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The order allowed engaging in outdoor activities as long as safe social distancing guidelines were followed. Pennsylvanians have responded by visiting their state parks, state forest lands, and municipal parks <a href=""https://www.fox43.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/pa-dcnr-shares-guidelines-for-those-who-want-to-spend-time-outdoors-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/521-239d4182-88e9-4827-b5f9-4fcaf7393e69"">in record numbers</a>. The opening of trout season <a href=""https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/fish-and-Boat-Commission-Details.aspx?newsid=316"">was pushed up by a week</a> to provide anglers more access to fish stocked streams. Whether for exercise, taking in the warm weather, getting our children outside, or wholesome recreation, it&rsquo;s clear that connecting&mdash;or for many re-connecting&mdash;with the historic trails, forests, streams, and lakes of Pennsylvania has been an important escape from the pandemic. The health crisis is re-teaching us how important our green spaces&mdash;and by extension the conservation of these special places&mdash;are to our mental and physical wellbeing. While for terrible reasons, new and old generations of hikers, anglers, birders, walkers, boaters, hunters, and runners are experiencing the state&rsquo;s natural beauty, which could have long term positive impact on the use and conservation of our public lands.</p>

<p><strong>2. Covid-19 is exacerbating the equity and justice gap between communities impacted by pollution and those that are not.</strong> Much reporting has been done on how the pandemic is impacting people differently. While blue collar workers are filing for unemployment, poor, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/coronavirus-race.html"">immigrant</a>, and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/coronavirus-race.html"">black and brown neighborhoods</a> are experiencing <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-coronavirus-and-inequality-meet-in-detroit"">higher levels of infection</a> and death than those that are more affluent. The pandemic is not necessarily an equal opportunist as its consequences are being felt more acutely by those without access to healthcare, those who can&rsquo;t work from home, and those with underlying health and morbidity conditions, such as those <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/climate/air-pollution-coronavirus-covid.html"">caused by chronic pollution</a>. According to new research from Harvard University, Covid-19 patients in areas with high levels of air pollution had a higher likelihood of death. Chronic air pollution from traffic, factories, and fossil fuel power plants cause more cases of asthma, lung disease, and cardiovascular disease that, when combined with severe lung inflammation caused by Covid-19, is often fatal. It brings into clear view the long-term damage caused by chronic pollution to our environmental justice communities and how reducing pollution should now more than ever be a top public health priority.</p>

<p><strong>3. The Commonwealth&rsquo;s boom-and-bust fossil fuel economy is unsustainable.</strong> Even before the pandemic, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fossil fuel economy was on its heels. Oil and gas company stock prices are down 60 percent this year irrespective of the pandemic and companies <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/business/energy-environment/coronavirus-oil-companies-debt.html"">are now drastically cutting</a> project costs and their workforce. <a href=""https://www.industryweek.com/supply-chain/planning-forecasting/article/21125045/covid19-is-coming-for-the-chemical-industry-in-2020-basf-frets"">Petrochemical companies worry</a> that Covid-19 will result in yet another year of falling profits and production. And any recession caused by the Covid-19 crisis <a href=""https://grist.org/beacon/covid-is-killing-coal/"">could mark the end</a> of already struggling coal plants and coal mines. In other words, the pandemic is laying bare an unfortunate truth many already know&mdash;the Commonwealth&rsquo;s fossil fuel industry has no clothes. The economic hopes hung around fracked gas, petrochemical facilities, and coal plants are a boom-and-bust mirage. It&rsquo;s what makes the state legislature&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Why-Does-Pennsylvania-Insist-on-Offering-Subsidies-to-Fracked-Gas-and-Petrochemicals-The-Industries-Would-Collapse-Without-Them"">attempts to provide billions</a> in taxpayer subsidies to the petrochemical industry even more unsettling. It puts into question why the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) would want to provide waste coal plants <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-DEP-is-Asking-Us-to-Pick-Up-the-Bill-for-Waste-CoalAgain"">yet another subsidy</a>. And it is inconceivable why the state Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) has made supporting a natural gas and plastics buildout <a href=""https://dced.pa.gov/key-industries/"">its top economic priority</a>. It&rsquo;s clear that Pennsylvania needs a new economic development strategy that doesn&rsquo;t rely on fossil fuels because our reliance on that industry is destroying not only the health of our communities, but their opportunity for long term, sustainable prosperity.</p>

<p><strong>4. The anti-environmental movement continues to advance even during a public health crisis. </strong>While the rest of the country and Commonwealth is focused on their safety and health during the Covid-19 crisis, the anti-environmental movement continues to advance its agenda. The Trump Administration made a stunning announcement <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Publication-PennFuture-urges-DEP-to-continue-enforcement-during-pandemic"">to suspend enforcement</a> of environmental and public health rules during the pandemic. The EPA is <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-eases-emissions-rules-make-cars-safer-but-ignores-facts-2020-4"">finalizing a rollback</a> of fuel efficiency standards that the car manufacturers originally helped write and celebrated. The Pennsylvania Senate waited until the health crisis was in full swing <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-reacts-to-House-Bill-1100-being-sent-to-Gov-Wolf"">to send to the Governor House Bill 1100</a>, which would have provided open-ended subsidies for petrochemical plants (he vetoed it). And right now, a group of state legislators <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2020/04/analysis-conservative-republicans.html"">are pushing legislation</a> to strip funds from environmental programs that conserve public land (see #1) <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2020/04/republicans-on-house-committee-report.html"">as well as limit environmental protections</a>. These efforts unveil how little regard the anti-environmental movement has for conservation, public health, and sustainable communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Post-Covid-19, the Commonwealth has a generational opportunity to reshape the economy toward sustainable economic development.</strong> I&rsquo;m an eternal optimist. Pennsylvania will make it through this health crisis. A new normal will set in, but our policymakers will need to get to work to restart the economy. The federal government already passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus to provide a 2-month bridge for workers and businesses and they already know that isn&rsquo;t enough to make it through the economic recession we&rsquo;re settling into. Federal, state, and municipal governments will need to enact a series of stimulus and economic recovery packages to get us through the economic inactivity caused by the crisis and then get everyone back to work. But it&rsquo;s clear we can&rsquo;t just restart what we were doing pre-pandemic for the reasons described above. The Commonwealth&rsquo;s economy was already on unsettled ground and throwing more money at unsustainable fossil fuel businesses puts our communities back in the same fear of boom-and-bust industries and fear of pollution impacts. Policymakers needs to get this right and invest in sustainable, shovel-ready projects that provide family-sustaining wages as well as invest in industries that create jobs without harming our air, water, land, and climate. This crisis should be a wake-up call to get moving on a stronger, better, more sustainable economy.</p>

Philly Can Achieve a Green New Deal through Green Stormwater Infrastructure,4/1/2020,"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the coronavirus pandemic hit Philadelphia, nearly half a million people have filed for unemployment, and that number will continue to rise. Nationwide the number of people who&rsquo;ve filed for unemployment has reached 6.6 million. We&rsquo;re observing a great depression in the making that will extend long after the pandemic crisis is over.</p>

<p>Last month, a group of climate and social experts in academia and civil society <a href=""https://medium.com/@green_stimulus_now"">released a letter laying out</a> a green stimulus proposal and called on the federal government to take action, a more robust policy plan to the Green New Deal resolution introduced by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and U.S. Sen. Ed Markey (D., M.A.).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Philadelphia should develop the institutional infrastructure now to prepare for a Green Stimulus package, while at the same time calling on the federal government to pass a medium-term stimulus package that invests in communities, workforce development, and protecting natural resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite an increase in jobs over the past ten years, Philadelphia has offered too few upward mobility pathways for residents in search of family-sustaining jobs. Of all jobs created since 2009, only 26 percent are in sectors paying more than $35,000 per year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve clean energy, clean water and community resiliency goals, a Green Stimulus promises to unleash millions in infrastructure investments that would produce thousands of dignified, high-wage jobs and stimulate the economy. These include construction and maintenance opportunities that reduce water pollution across the region.</p>

<p>The city&rsquo;s elected leaders are already advancing some of the climate change and economic policies described in the Green Stimulus letter. Among newly inaugurated City Council members, 11 of 17 members support creating a local Green New Deal, per a survey PennFuture conducted with other groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet Philly&rsquo;s largest green jobs initiative does not receive enough attention. To lay the groundwork for a local Green Stimulus, we need to refocus attention on the Philadelphia Water Department. The Philadelphia Water Department and its related operations employs thousands of Philadelphians. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/about-philadelphia-water-dept-green-city"">The Green City, Clean Waters program</a> is one of those programs, which is creating jobs and taking PWD into the water utility of the future green economy.</p>

<p>Green City, Clean Waters funds public and private projects across the city that filter stormwater through rocks, soil and plants, limiting the release of pollution into regional waterways caused by sewer system overflows. Beyond cleaner water, these green stormwater infrastructure projects create jobs, improve our local economy and prepare our communities for the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>To maximize the workforce-redevelopment potential of Green City, Clean Waters, Philly leadership needs to renew the city&rsquo;s dedication to the program. By addressing current barriers to green stormwater infrastructure, including obstacles within city-led programs such as Rebuild, we can address our water pollution challenges while producing hundreds of new jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>From Factory Jobs to Stormwater Careers</strong></p>

<p>After losing 263,000 jobs from 1970 to 2010, Philly <a href=""https://www.centercityphila.org/uploads/attachments/ck24wk9av08l08lqdv2nmwekd-19-jobs-report-web-update.pdf"">had recently been adding jobs</a> at a faster rate than the country&rsquo;s 25 largest cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, as of 2018, the city still offered 23,000 fewer jobs compared to 1990. This is despite a 69,000-person increase in <a href=""https://www.philaworks.org/philadelphias-population/"">&ldquo;prime working age&rdquo;</a> residents over the same period. And the new jobs were mostly for entry-level work&mdash; most have been in sectors that pay on average $35,000 or less.</p>

<p>The rise in predominantly low-wage jobs contrasts with the opportunities available designing, installing or maintaining green stormwater infrastructure. <a href=""https://gsipartners.sbnphiladelphia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBN_FINAL-REPORT.pdf"">A 2016 study estimates</a> Green City, Clean Waters then supported 430 local jobs and $27 million in annual labor income. Over its 20-year period, the program has been forecasted to produce 1,000 jobs per year.</p>

<p>Such work is generally accessible, well-paying and protected, with many employees offered meaningful advancement opportunities.</p>

<p>Green stormwater infrastructure operations and maintenance jobs typically require a high school diploma or less. Workers earning entry-level wages are, in all likelihood, collecting near minimum wage. But once workers are trained and experienced, they often receive higher wages as they transition from entry-level jobs to roles that require more training and certification. <a href=""https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/greenforall/pages/1562/attachments/original/1412187831/Staying-Green-and-Growing-Jobs-April-2013.pdf.pdf?1412187831"">National data suggests</a> work experience, a high school diploma and additional job-related course work can offer wages upward of $20 per hour.</p>

<p>Workers involved in public projects are even more likely to earn living wages and benefits. Unionization rates in green stormwater infrastructure occupations are likely higher than the nationwide rate of 10 percent. Examples of high union representation among green stormwater infrastructure roles include jobs within the plumbing (20 percent), construction (18.5 percent) and landscape maintenance (15 percent) trades.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Unlock More Green Stormwater Infrastructure Work</strong></p>

<p>As Philadelphia City Council&rsquo;s environmental leaders discuss what a Green Stimulus means for the city, their legislative agendas must start by addressing current barriers to implementing Green City Clean Waters, including within other city programs such as the <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/programs/rebuild/project-sites/"">Rebuild Community Infrastructure Initiative.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through Rebuild, Philly continues to break ground on much-needed renovation of parks, recreation centers and libraries. At PennFuture, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Opportunity-for-Green-Stormwater-Infrastructure-in-Philadelphias-Rebuild-Initiative"">we have advocated that Philadelphia leaders</a> combine the goals of Green City, Clean Waters and Rebuild. In doing so, Philadelphia can align two major infrastructure investments and multiply the workforce development impact of these important programs.</p>

<p>In 2020, <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/2020-01-17-14-rebuild-projects-to-get-excited-about-in-2020/"">Rebuild is set to break ground</a> at six refurbished playgrounds. Green stormwater infrastructure does not currently appear to be included in any of these projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Green jobs attract a diverse workforce. Including more green stormwater infrastructure projects within Philadelphia&rsquo;s capital improvements could be a means to increase minority participation.</p>

<p>Rebuild, once estimated to reach $500 million in spending, pledged to award at least a third of construction contracts and a quarter of professional services contracts to minority- and women-owned firms. So far, <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WBSxQ_1OGEXdIA7fPeHA2Mn6wRhxXHX_/view"">less than 28 percent</a> of Rebuild construction contracts and 24 percent of professional services have been allocated toward minority-owned firms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A study of <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/2019-06-06-office-of-economic-opportunity-releases-fy18-disparity-study/"">Fiscal Year 2018 contracts</a> found minority-owned firms were included on $1.45 billion of city-issued and quasi-public contracts. About 30 percent of this spending went directly to minority-owned firms, a slight decrease from FY17 and short of the city&rsquo;s 35 percent goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Our Message to City Council</strong></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not stop at Rebuild. Philly should require consideration of green stormwater infrastructure in every public capital project &mdash; just like developers must now install green stormwater infrastructure in larger new construction projects.</p>

<p>From school playgrounds and recreation center ballfields to streets and sidewalks, we need city leadership to join together and share responsibility for these stormwater initiatives. That includes funding a Clean Water Act Task Force coordinator position within the Managing Director&rsquo;s Office to develop a strategic plan that addresses interagency coordination.</p>

<p>Finally, to invest in jobs and infrastructure to address climate change, city leaders should call on PWD to plan for sustainable funding for GSI maintenance to ensure long-term success of green stormwater infrastructure.</p>

<p>If we take the Green New Deal seriously, green stormwater infrastructure is an opportunity for City Council to rise to the challenge and to transform Philadelphia&rsquo;s economy while creating jobs, protecting clean water and building climate resilience.&nbsp;</p>

DEP is Asking Us to Pick Up the Bill for Waste Coal...Again,3/23/2020,"<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-First-Glimpse-PennFuture-analyzes-draft-of-DEPs-cap-and-invest-program"">developing a CO2 trading program</a> compatible with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-First-Glimpse-PennFuture-analyzes-draft-of-DEPs-cap-and-invest-program"">first draft of the program</a> would establish a state-wide cap on carbon emissions and require generators of electricity with a rated capacity of at least 25 megawatts (MW) to obtain allowances for each ton of CO2 they emit. Under the RGGI program, most of these allowances will be obtained through an auction, but it also allows a certain number of credits to be <a href=""https://www.rggi.org/sites/default/files/Uploads/Allowance-Tracking/States_Set-Aside_Accounts.pdf"">set aside for special purposes</a>. This provides for policy flexibility, but also opens the door to bad decisions that will limit carbon reductions.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet=""""><u><strong>The Proposed Waste Coal Set Aside</strong></u></p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">DEP is proposing one set aside&mdash;reserving 7.9 million tons worth of allowances to be given away for free to electric generators that burn low-quality coal that mining companies dumped in huge piles all over the state&rsquo;s mining regions and left communities to deal with its hazards.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Pennsylvania has hundreds of millions of tons of waste coal piles and some have been leaching pollution into our streams and rivers for over a hundred years&mdash;in the worst cases, these piles can catch on fire and pollute the air as well. The companies that caused this pollution have often long-since gone out of business so, if the waste is going to be cleaned up, the state will either need to appropriate the funds to pay for it or find some other solution.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Digging up this coal and transferring it to appropriately-sited and designed disposal facilities is an expensive proposition. In some cases, it&rsquo;s possible to stabilize the piles in place by planting beach grass or other vegetation; that is much cheaper but it would still require the state to appropriate clean-up funds. Compared to paying for cleanup, it&rsquo;s not surprising our leaders see burning this waste in power plants as an acceptable alternative.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">While new technology makes it possible to use this fuel in power plants, it&rsquo;s still a low-quality fuel. This means that waste coal plants tend to produce more air pollution than most other types of generation. In fact, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waste coal plants are up to thirty percent more carbon polluting than some conventional coal plants and more than twice as carbon polluting as natural gas plants. By choosing to burn this waste, we are trading pollution of our land and water for increased emissions of air toxins, greenhouse gases, and other pollutants.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Proponents of waste coal argue that the environmental and public health benefits of cleaning up the waste piles more than make up for the added air pollution. Whether or not that is true in any particular case is not only a difficult technical problem, it&rsquo;s also a challenging ethical issue&mdash;for all the benefits on one end, someone else will be paying the price with adverse health impacts.&nbsp; We all support clean water and pristine landscapes, but is it fair for the most vulnerable to be asked to pay the price?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">By and large, our leaders don&rsquo;t appear to have spent a lot of time worrying about the ethics or the technical details. Leaching waste coal piles are obvious sources of pollution everyone in the community can see, whereas air pollution is often invisible and the health impacts happen miles away and maybe years later, making it easier to ignore.&nbsp;</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Proponents also argue that waste coal is a good financial deal for the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s far from true and their need for consistent taxpayer subsidies, even though waste coal is a mature technology, is proof enough. The fact that this is low-quality fuel means the plants that burn it have difficulty competing with more efficient generation and are constantly on the lookout for subsidies that help them remain profitable. The federal government effectively built this industry through subsidies resulting from the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) which allowed these plants to sell power at above-market rates.&nbsp; Since that time, more subsidies have followed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) program includes waste coal in its &ldquo;Tier II&rdquo; category under which facilities collectively received over $2.5 million in subsidies in 2018. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Coal Refuse Energy and Reclamation Tax Credit already provides $10 million in annual subsidies and a new subsidy bill (SB 618) would, if passed, increase that to $45 million.&nbsp; In addition to direct subsidies like these, we also see repeated efforts at the state and federal level to roll back environmental protections to benefit these plants.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">In addition to all these existing subsidies, 7.9 million tons of free allowances will amount to another gift worth about $40 million. The DEP will effectively be saying that most plants must pay something to offset the damage their carbon pollution is causing, but the rest of us will pick up the tab for waste coal. Worse yet, when dirty energy is subsidized, that makes it that much harder for cleaner and better alternatives to compete in the market.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet=""""><u><strong>DEP Should Rethink its Waste Coal Policy</strong></u></p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Pennsylvania policymakers should also take a hard look at the costs vs. benefits from waste coal, including a thorough assessment of the public health and climate damage it is causing. If the state decides to accept the public health risks and continue subsidizing these plants, it must narrowly target those subsidies to prevent paying for more pollution.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">At a minimum, that means the DEP should insert basic criteria into its CO2 credit trading rule that ensures the citizens of Pennsylvania will see a net benefit. For example, when Maryland gives plants allowances through their Limited Industrial Exemption Set-aside Account (<a href=""http://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/comarhtml/26/26.09.02.06.htm"">LIESA</a>), they require plants to submit a climate action plan demonstrating that they have employed reasonably available methods to reduce their CO2 emissions. Similarly, the DEP could require waste coal operators receiving additional subsidies to document that:</p>

<ul font-size:="""" style=""padding: 0px 40px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">
	<li>we are remediating the most damaging waste piles first;</li>
	<li>we are not overlooking cheaper solutions to stabilize particular waste piles;</li>
	<li>plants are operating as cleanly and efficiently as possible;</li>
	<li>plants are in compliance with all environmental regulations;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>And, we are not subsidizing polluting plants more than is absolutely necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet=""""><u><strong>Planning for the Retirement of Waste Coal</strong></u></p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">The DEP&rsquo;s should also address a significant issue with how it reduces set aside allowances as power generation reduces over time.&nbsp;When DEP sets the initial carbon cap, it will consider the amount of electricity generation we expect to consume and the carbon intensity of our available generation mix. Multiplied together, that will give us the amount of CO2 allowances needed to satisfy demand. If the cap is too high, the credits will be devalued and won&rsquo;t drive emissions reductions. If the cap is too low, there is a risk that the cost-containment reserve will be triggered and more allowances will be added to the pool.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Because <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/emissions/"">waste coal emits</a> about 1.3 tons of CO2 per MWh of generation, the 7.9 million tons of allowances equates to about 5.9 million MWh of generation. Nobody is building new coal or nuclear plants in Pennsylvania, so when that waste coal retires, it&rsquo;s likely to be replaced with some natural gas generation, some clean renewable generation, and efficiency improvements.&nbsp;Natural gas&mdash;the dirtiest of the likely alternatives&mdash;produces about half a ton of CO2 per MWh and the other options produce zero, so the worst-case scenario would be that the lost generation from waste coal can be replaced with just 3.0 million allowances. The other 2.9 million allowances are unneeded, but added to the pool anyway which will depress allowance prices and allow emissions growth.</p>

<p font-size:="""" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, "" trebuchet="""">Reaching net-zero carbon pollution by 2050 will continue to be a challenge and what to do with waste coal is part of that question.&nbsp;While we work to solve that problem, it&rsquo;s vital we don&rsquo;t make the situation worse. Governor Wolf&rsquo;s plan to institute a carbon cap is an important step, but creating loopholes for polluters is a dangerous precedent.&nbsp;</p>

We believe HB 1100 is rooted in corporate greed and preys not only on the largesse of taxpayers, but on the desperation of regions like northeast Pennsylvania, where family-sustaining wages and jobs are dwindling. It&rsquo;s created an environment where any economic salvation, even giveaways to petrochemical manufacturers, are being embraced, despite the impacts this industry will have on our communities, health, land, air and water.</p>

Our opponents&rsquo; messaging&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;re for jobs&rdquo;&mdash;went unanswered that day by those of us who also stand for jobs&mdash;jobs that also will sustain families&mdash;but jobs that will not pollute our environment and health.

Why Does Pennsylvania Insist on Offering Subsidies to Fracked Gas and Petrochemicals? The Industries Would Collapse Without Them,2/19/2020,"<p>Harrisburg policymakers are, again, debating whether to give more taxpayer-funded handouts to the fracking and petrochemical industries. It continues a quiet truth about Pennsylvania&rsquo;s so-called fracking miracle&mdash;without taxpayers padding industry profits, its presence in the Commonwealth would collapse. It&rsquo;s high time we tell our elected officials to stop propping up the fracking and petrochemical industry in Pennsylvania and instead build a diverse, long-term sustainable economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, state legislators approved House Bill 1100 which, if signed by the governor, would provide billions of dollars in taxpayer handouts over the next 30 years to a suite of petrochemical, plastics, and cracker plant facilities.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a new idea. It is modeled after a $1.6 billion tax handout generously given to Royal Dutch Shell in 2012, which is underpinning the construction of a massive factory along the Ohio River in Beaver County that will turn fracked gas into plastics feedstock. Industry boosters argue the handout will support 600 permanent jobs on the site, meaning each job carries with it <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2020/02/13/Sara-Innamorato-Socialized-risk-privatized-profits-House-Bill-1100-petrochemical-Pennsylvania/stories/202002130024"">a $2.75 million subsidy paid for by all of us</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an astronomical price to pay for an amount of jobs that represents less than one percent of Beaver County&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.workstats.dli.pa.gov/Documents/County%20Profiles/Beaver%20County.pdf"">total workforce of 81,000 people</a>. It&rsquo;s also an astronomical price to pay for an economically and environmentally unsustainable industry.</p>

<p><u>Natural Gas Industry Teetering on a Financial Cliff</u></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to attain a clear picture of the financial woes facing the fracked gas and petrochemical industries and why they need a taxpayer bailout.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.eenews.net/stories/1061136849"">According to E&amp;E News</a>, the fracked gas industry is headed for a financial cliff because the initial generation of fracked wells are falling in productivity. In order for companies to grow and provide shareholders profits, they need to drill more wells in less ideal locations, increasing their costs for declining benefit.</p>

<p>This is having devastating impacts on fracking companies. According to a study <a href=""http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Q4-2018_More-Red-Flags-on-Fracking_March-2019.pdf"">by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis</a>, a group of 29 large shale gas companies in 2018 had their spending outpace reported income by $6.7 billion. From 2010 to 2018, those companies recorded a cash flow totaling negative $181 billion.</p>

<p>Since 2015, there have been 172 gas <a href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/2019/06/23/former-shale-gas-ceo-says-shale-revolution-has-been-disaster-drillers-investors"">&ldquo;exploration and production&rdquo; company bankruptcies</a> involving nearly a hundred billion dollars of debt, including 42 &ldquo;E&amp;P&rdquo; <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bankruptcies-in-Fracking-Sector-Mount-in-2019_January-2020.pdf"">bankruptcies in 2019</a>. Given the massive wave of debt facing the industry, more bankruptcies <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bankruptcies-in-Fracking-Sector-Mount-in-2019_January-2020.pdf"">are all but certain</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania natural gas players are at the center of this financial cliff. In the largest write-down by an energy producer in years, <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/chevron-facing-fossil-fuels-glut-takes-10-billion-charge-11576012579"">Chevron reported recently</a> it is cutting the value of several properties, notably its shale holdings in Appalachia, by more than $10 billion. According to the Wall Street Journal, this move represents a &ldquo;concession that...some of its holdings won&rsquo;t be profitable anytime soon.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>More proof can be found in CNX Resources, a <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/01/31/Marcellus-shale-gas-reserves-CNX-EQT-Chevron-pennsylvania/stories/202001300154"">Washington County-based shale gas company</a> that is writing down $446 million in assets in central Pennsylvania. The move means that oil and gas reserves in that area are no longer considered economic and will not be developed in the near future.</p>

<p>Perhaps most important is Pittsburgh-based EQT Corp., the largest fracked gas producer in the country. <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/01/31/Marcellus-shale-gas-reserves-CNX-EQT-Chevron-pennsylvania/stories/202001300154"">The company recently announced</a> it will write down between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion in assets. In total, EQT, Range Resources, and CNX <a href=""https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/pittsburghs-fracking-industry-cut-more-than-400-jobs-in-2019-with-more-cuts-likely-on-the-way/Content?oid=16477996"">have cut a combined total</a> of more than 400 jobs since January 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former EQT CEO Steve Schlotterbeck <a href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/2019/06/23/former-shale-gas-ceo-says-shale-revolution-has-been-disaster-drillers-investors"">put it succinctly in June 2019</a> to a crowd of petrochemical industrialists that, &ldquo;The shale gas revolution has frankly been an unmitigated disaster for any buy-and-hold investor in the shale gas industry with very few limited exceptions.&rdquo; Schlotterbeck ended, &ldquo;The industry is self-destructive.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u>Fossil Fuel Industries Require Taxpayer Handouts to Stay Afloat</u></p>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise then that fossil fuel companies like fracking and petrochemical companies require taxpayer handouts to be successful. And during the modern day history of these industries, federal and state governments on behalf of taxpayers have fronted that bill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our federal government provides both direct and indirect subsidies to the fossil fuel industry at an alarming rate. <a href=""https://www.eesi.org/files/FactSheet_Fossil_Fuel_Subsidies_0719.pdf"">According to a report</a> from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, conservative estimates put direct U.S. subsidies to the fossil fuel industry at about $20 billion per year, with about 80 percent of that allocated to the fracked gas and crude oil segments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The situation is similar in Pennsylvania. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/News/FossilFuelSubsidyReport_PennFuture.pdf"">According to a PennFuture report</a>, taxpayers provided more than $3.2 billion in fossil fuel subsidies during fiscal year 2012-2013, which equals $794 per Pennsylvania taxpayer. Approximately 92 percent ($3 billion) of these subsidies came in the form of tax breaks.</p>

<p>Adding billions more in state taxpayer largesse through House Bill 1100 would be more of the same for both the industry and Pennsylvania. In fact, groups like <a href=""https://www.theintelligencer.net/news/top-headlines/2018/06/shale-crescent-usa-wants-to-rebrand-region/"">Shale Crescent USA</a> and the <a href=""https://www.pachamber.org/media/2516/Forge_the_Future_Phase_2_Report_101118/"">PA Chamber of Business and Industry</a> are pitching the so-called Appalachian Storage Hub&mdash;a sprawling, multi-state complex of petrochemical cracker plants, plastics manufacturing, compressor stations, pipelines, and underground storage facilities&mdash;as a sort of savior to the failing fracking industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The so-called economic miracle of fracking is now being replaced by the promise of plastics, except the petrochemical industry requires the same subsidies and deregulation that the fracking industry did to stay afloat. We&rsquo;re simply replacing one failing industry with another, both leaders in polluting our air, water, and climate.</p>

<p><u>Regions that Tie Their Economic Future to Subsidized Industries are in Trouble</u></p>

<p>Those pushing billions in subsidies to the industry frame them as necessary for economic expansion and prosperity in areas that desperately need both. Family-sustaining jobs are promised as our leaders shell out tax breaks and subsidies at an alarming rate to executives and shareholders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem with that thinking is that geographic areas that have linked their economic futures to fracked gas and petrochemicals are still experiencing population losses. For instance, from the period of 2010 to 2018, the Pittsburgh metropolitan area - which includes all of southwestern Pennsylvania, experienced a population loss of -1.4 percent.</p>

<p>In comparison, <a href=""https://www.coalfieldjustice.org/blog/2020/2/14/fracking-and-petrochemicals-good-for-our-economic-future"">metropolitan areas that don&rsquo;t link</a> their economies to fracking and petrochemicals have done much better: Columbus, Ohio had its population increase by 13.1 percent, Lexington, Kentucky saw a 9.4 percent increase, and Indianapolis experienced a 5.7 percent increase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear the industry relies on government intervention to stay afloat, even in the face of statistics that show population and jobs losses in the areas where the industry is most prominent.&nbsp;One last example hammers home that point: like Pennsylvania, Louisiana offers generous taxpayer handouts to the fracked gas and petrochemical industries, <a href=""https://twitter.com/RyanDeto/status/1228007439695581184?s=20"">but the state has lost</a> 40,000 manufacturing jobs in the last 20 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of this information begs a question: if the industry is performing this poorly here and nationally despite taxpayer subsidies, where would it be without government intervention? And why are our leaders in Pennsylvania relying on such an unstable and uneconomic industry?</p>

<p><u>Pennsylvania Should Reject Fossil Fuel Subsidies Once and For All</u></p>

<p>This ongoing push for a bailout should put industry priorities in clear view: they&rsquo;re trying to squeeze as much profit out of the state as they can before packing up and leaving Pennsylvania. Like the coal and oil barons before them, the fracking and petrochemical industries&nbsp;will leave taxpayers with&nbsp;debt, orphaned wells, brownfields, environmental clean-up, and an unstable economy.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania should reject the taxpayer bailout charade of House Bill 1100 and instead plan and invest in a more strategic, long-term sustainable, and environmentally positive economy that won&rsquo;t put taxpayers and communities in harm&#39;s way.</p>

What is the Transportation and Climate Initiative?,2/11/2020,"<p>Gov. Tom Wolf&rsquo;s administration has released an initial proposal for how Pennsylvania might cap carbon emissions from the state&rsquo;s electricity sector, the first step in <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-First-Glimpse-PennFuture-analyzes-draft-of-DEPs-cap-and-invest-program"">potentially joining a regional emission trading system</a>.</p>

<p>At PennFuture, we have long called for Pennsylvania to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But we know the electricity sector only accounts for a third of U.S. carbon emissions. That&rsquo;s why Pennsylvania and other Northeast and Mid Atlantic states exploring another &ldquo;cap-and-invest&rdquo; approach&mdash;to address transportation-related carbon pollution&mdash;is equally important.</p>

<p>Transportation accounts for <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=41093"">37 percent of energy consumed</a> in the United States and about an equal share of the greenhouse gas emissions from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.</p>

<p>State leaders recognize that more aggressive action is needed to halt the rise in transportation-related pollution and to empower a cleaner future. Pennsylvania is among 12 states and Washington, D.C. now considering a proposed approach to raise up to $68 billion over 10 years to modernize our public transportation systems, expand electric vehicle charging networks and transition fleets of heavy-duty vehicles to run on cleaner fuels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The program is called&nbsp;the <a href=""http://www.transportationandclimate.org/"">T</a><a href=""https://www.transportationandclimate.org/"">ransportation and Climate Initiative (TCI)</a>, a coalition of state regulators who recently proposed a cap-and-invest framework for the transportation sector. The proposal sets a goal to reduce carbon emissions 20&ndash;25 percent below 2005 levels by 2032. As a cap-and-invest policy, regulated entities would be provided annual carbon pollution &ldquo;allowances.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike the power, industrial, or building sectors, the transportation sector is <a href=""https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/10/everything-you-need-know-about-fastest-growing-source-global-emissions-transport"">far more distributed and complex</a>. Across the region, more than 52 million tailpipes&mdash;from cars, light duty trucks, and other vehicles&mdash;spew gasoline and diesel-based exhaust and contribute to climate change. That said, like the other sectors of the economy, technology solutions are emerging and getting cheaper every year, including electric vehicle technologies, new charging infrastructure, and new vehicle efficiency technologies and materials, among others.</p>

<p>To catalyze these investments, state regulators have considered a range of policy approaches. Options include tightening vehicle fuel efficiency standards, placing a carbon tax on fuel consumption, or enacting carbon regulations on the country&rsquo;s 1,400 crude oil producers.</p>

<p>The TCI coalition is looking seriously at the latter of these options. The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.transportationandclimate.org/main-menu/tcis-regional-policy-design-process-2019"">draft framework would limit pollution</a> from entities who supply fuel directly to the TCI members. Fuel distributors would need to stay within an overall pollution limit beginning at 254 million metric tons per year in 2022. Distributors would purchase allowances proportional to their contributions to regional transport emissions. Allowances would decrease over time, drawing down total emissions.</p>

<p>There are 14 large oil refineries located in the TCI states. These and other regional suppliers would potentially be regulated by the framework. Owners of terminals and pipelines may also be included under future rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pollution allowances would be auctioned by the states and the&nbsp; proceeds would be invested into cleaner, more resilient, more equitable low-carbon transportation systems that not only reduce pollution but also mitigate the costs to consumers. Initial estimates forecast that allowance prices of about $22 per ton would be necessary by 2022 in order to reach the 25 percent emission-reduction target. If prices reached such levels, the framework would raise about $5.6 billion per year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Within this &ldquo;pay to pollute&rdquo; model, TCI is considering an alternative for distributors who may not wish to buy allowances. A potentially more affordable option would be to purchase carbon offsets. These projects would have to demonstrate verifiable, voluntary carbon reductions from investments in various sustainable forestry, agriculture or clean energy activities.</p>

<p>TCI states have yet to adopt their rules or to announce their proposed emission limits. Until then, the cost of the program is unclear, with ranges that depend on the aggressiveness of allowance caps. Initial studies predict gasoline consumers may be charged 7&ndash;29 cents more per gallon over 12 years, but consumers can control costs through the use of more efficient vehicles,&nbsp; public transportation, reducing unnecessary trips through telecommuting, or other cleaner transportation policies. Potential investments made in infrastructure projects and more efficient technologies would offset these costs and give consumers even more choices.</p>

<p>In fact, if spread across the transportation economy, the framework&rsquo;s benefits far outweigh potential program costs. <a href=""https://www.georgetownclimate.org/files/report/GCC-Reducing_GHG_Emissions_from_Transportation-11.24.15.pdf"">A TCI analysis estimates</a> net economic savings of $28.7&ndash;$54.5 billion for businesses and $3.6&ndash;$18 billion for consumers over a 15-year period. A cleaner, more efficient transportation system would also help avoid more than 1,000 premature deaths, prevent 1,300 asthma attacks and dodge 1,700 traffic injuries&mdash;resulting in up to $10 billion in public health benefits per year.</p>

<p>Recent polls suggest strong support among both urban and rural commuters. A <a href=""https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/TNC_TCI_Survey_2019_Public.pdf"">November 2019 survey found</a> 63 percent of Pennsylvania respondents would be willing to pay up to $20 per month to fund cleaner transportation choices across the state.</p>

<p>It is critical for Pennsylvania to consider the transportation sector when determining how we can best address climate change. PennFuture will continue to closely follow the Transportation Climate Initiative and fight for ambitious and equitable policies to transition our carbon-based economy. Stay tuned for more updates as proposed regulations take shape.&nbsp;</p>

"Fallacy, Fiction, and Falsehoods: Debunking RGGI Myths Part 1",2/4/2020,"<p>On January 31st, 2020 the Department of Environmental Protection <a href=""http://On January 31st, 2020 the Department of Environmental Protection released its proposal to advance a cap-and-invest program to reduce carbon emissions in Pennsylvania that is compatible with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Facing the prospect of actually having to pay for their pollution rather than being allowed to dump it in the air for free, polluters and their friends are mobilizing to oppose the proposal with fallacies and mistruths.  Check out PennFuture’s primer on the RGGI process and its role in cutting the Commonwealth’s carbon emissions as well as an assessment of why efforts by the legislature to limit the Governor’s climate authority are misguided  Below are three of the most inaccurate statements made so far by polluter-friendly elected officials in Pennsylvania, along with responses debunking these dubious and misleading claims.   1. Legislative approval is required to execute a carbon cap-and-trade program. On Jan. 16., state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe sent a letter to the executive committee of RGGI, asking them not to move forward with Pennsylvania’s proposed entry into RGGI. In his letter, Metcalfe claimed Pennsylvania has a “rogue governor” and that “Pennsylvania law requires that in order for the governor to execute a carbon cap-and-trade program such as RGGI, explicit approval is required from our Commonwealth’s legislative branch.”  Response:  Legislative approval is not required. Pennsylvania’s Air Pollution Control Act gives the DEP, through approval of the Environmental Quality Board (EQB), very clear authority to set limits on pollution and, where necessary, cooperate with other states to do so. The DEP’s proposed rule couldn’t be more clear that interstate compact is required. It says “The Department will determine whether to participate in multistate CO2 allowance auctions in coordination with other participating states or to conduct Pennsylvania-run auctions…”—the proposal also contains specific provisions for a Pennsylvania-run program and says that we will only participate in a multi-state auction if the DEP determines there is one that is compatible with our program and the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs.  Article I § 27 of Pennsylvania’s Constitution says that our “public natural resources are the common property of all the people” and that the Commonwealth acts as trustee to “conserve and maintain” those resources. Instead of questioning the governor’s authority to act, Rep. Metcalfe should ask himself why he thinks it’s acceptable for polluting industries to dump their waste products into our air for free. How is that consistent with his oath of office?  2. Pennsylvania is already a leader in cutting carbon emissions, so joining RGGI is not needed. In an Oct. 16 edition of the Pennsylvania Business Report, Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman argued that “Pennsylvania is out ahead of many states when it comes to reducing carbon emissions through the RGGI compact...But joining a compact where you give up state independence, in an area where we are already making improvements, seems shortsighted and leaves us open to the possibility of being stuck with the poor decisions and outcomes for others in the agreement.”  Similarly, in a news release issued on Oct. 3, the House Republican Caucus argued that “Pennsylvania’s energy sector is currently reducing greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 30 percent in recent years, according to some estimates, and the industry is doing this without burdensome regulations.”  Response: Of course Senator Corman and the House Republican Caucus know they are comparing apples and oranges—they just hope you don’t notice. For all its “progress,” Pennsylvania is the fourth-highest emitter of carbon pollution in the nation behind California, Texas, and Florida. New natural gas plants have driven most of our coal generation out of business reducing our emissions, but we started with about one and a half times the coal generation as all of the other RGGI states combined. This is a case of being so far behind, the Senator thinks we are in first place. The real issue though is not what we did, but how we move forward.  We don’t have enough coal left for the trends of the past to continue and neither the Senator nor the Republican Caucus have a plan to solve our emissions problem. Rather than reducing emissions, they are working on a package of bills to further subsidize fossil fuel generation. Gas has likely already become a bigger source of carbon pollution than coal in the state and replacing additional lost generation with gas will result in net increases in pollution—we can’t drill our way to a clean and healthy environment.    Instead of more fossil fuel subsidies, we need to implement a program like RGGI to cap carbon pollution and invest in carbon-free alternatives like clean renewable energy and energy efficiency. A recent report by The Analysis Group shows CO2 emissions in the RGGI states have dropped from over 180 million tons per year to under 80 million tons per year while providing over $1.4 billion in net economic benefits. That is the kind of progress we need. 3. Joining RGGI will increase electricity prices and result in job losses. In a June 24 article published by the Commonwealth Foundation, the author implies that RGGI will result in a 64 percent increase in the price of electricity, while it will also result in a loss of between 7,000 to 11,000 jobs per year.  Response:  To come by those shocking numbers, the Commonwealth Foundation relies on a “working paper” by David Stephenson of the Caesar Rodney Institute. Both organizations are part of a Koch-funded umbrella organization called the State Policy Network that actively opposes climate change regulations, so it shouldn’t surprise anyone that they are cherry-picking data to try and make their point. What is surprising is that the Commonwealth Foundation found it necessary to cherry-pick data from a report that already cherry-picked data. The underlying report actually says prices in RGGI increased less than the average in the US, they just increased more than “comparison states.” If you skip their alternative facts altogether and go directly to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) report on average state prices (the authority they cite) you get a much different picture. Average price per megawatt hour (MWh) across all sectors in RGGI did rise 7% from 2007 through 2016, but the prices in Pennsylvania and the U.S. as a whole rose more than 12% over that same time period. If you update the data to 2018 (the most current available) RGGI is even better with a 6.6% increase from 2007 compared to an 11.2% increase in Pennsylvania and 15.3% for the U.S. as a whole. The other critical factor groups like this purposely ignore is that the cost per MWh is only one part of your bill. If a family or business installs solar generation or invests in energy efficiency, their monthly electric bills can drop substantially even if the retail price of power goes up. The RGGI states take advantage of this by investing in efficiency and renewable—far more than Pennsylvania. To make their claims on job losses, the Commonwealth Foundation resorts to another report from a State Policy Network affiliate, this time from Rhode Island. The really surprising thing about this report is that it doesn’t pretend to be about RGGI at all—this is a report about renewable energy portfolio standards that tries to claim investing in clean renewable generation though programs like Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) causes job losses. What we know for a fact is that the remaining large coal plants in Pennsylvania are all nearing retirement age and no plans are on the table to build more. These plants will eventually close with or without RGGI—we need to plan for what is next. Adding more natural gas is a climate killer so we need better choices. Right now, far from being sources of job losses, the largest job growth sectors in the U.S. are solar installers and wind technicians. Pennsylvania in particular has over 68,000 energy efficiency jobs and over 9,000 renewable energy jobs. Clean and renewable energy has more potential job growth than dirty fossil fuels. Next steps The title of this blog says it’s “Part 1” of a series debunking lies, myths, and misconceptions about RGGI and carbon pricing. While it would be nice if a “Part 2” was not required, the people who are making these claims are not likely to stop.

First Glimpse: PennFuture analyzes draft of DEP's cap-and-invest program,2/4/2020,"<p>On February 13th, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Air/AirQuality/AQPortalFiles/Advisory%20Committees/Air%20Quality%20Technical%20Advisory%20Committee/2020/2-13-20/AQTAC%20PA%20CO2%20Budget%20Trading%20Program_February%202020.pdf"">will be presenting the first draft</a> of the regulatory language for a <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Air/AirQuality/AQPortalFiles/Advisory%20Committees/Air%20Quality%20Technical%20Advisory%20Committee/2020/2-13-20/Draft%20PRN%20CO2%20Budget%20Trading%20Annex%20A%201-30-20.pdf"">&ldquo;CO2 Budget Trading Program&rdquo;</a> to the Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee (AQTAC), a <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-So-Pennsylvania-Might-Join-RGGI-What-Comes-Next"">positive next step</a> in a long 18 to 24 month regulatory process. The draft provides some key details&mdash;and questions&mdash;on the Governor&rsquo;s intention to create a state cap-and-trade program to cut electricity sector carbon emission.</p>

<p><strong>How does Cap-and-Invest Work?</strong></p>

<p>Cap-and-invest is a longstanding carbon reduction tool with a very straightforward concept: the state sets a carbon limit for an industry that declines over time and provides annual &ldquo;allowances&rdquo; to carbon polluters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the case of Pennsylvania, the Governor intends to enact a cap-and-invest program for power plants with a capacity over 25 megawatts (MW). Power plant owners must obtain allowances for each ton of pollution they emit in any given year. As the carbon cap decreases, the cost of allowances will increase and polluters will be incentivized to invest in lower-carbon technologies. For those generators that continue to emit, the costs of pollution will be better reflected in the wholesale price of the energy they sell.</p>

<p>Economically, this is the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle in action&mdash;rather than subsidizing the cost of pollution for dirty plants, we will monetize the costs of that pollution and let the market make better-informed choices about what power to buy.&nbsp; The proceeds from power plant owners buying allowances would be invested back into efforts to reduce air and carbon pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When this rule goes into effect in Pennsylvania, the DEP will issue a specific number of allowances, each one representing one ton of CO2 emissions. To emit carbon pollution, power plants will need to obtain sufficient allowances. For example, a reasonably modern natural gas plant will require about one allowance for every two and a half megawatt hours (MWh) of generation. Coal plants, which produce significantly more carbon pollution, will need around twice as many allowances per MWh. Of course, carbon free generation like nuclear, wind, and solar won&rsquo;t need any allowances at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Choices will Polluters Have?</strong></p>

<p>Given a choice, carbon polluters would want to keep the status quo where they get to dump pollution in the air for free. While this proposal closes that particular candy store, companies still have a number of options to make compliance easier and less costly.</p>

<p><u><em>Pollution Prevention</em></u>: Investing in efficiency improvements or changing their operations so they emit less pollution. When pollution is no longer free such changes will be more cost-effective.</p>

<p><u><em>Permit Conditions</em></u>: Power plant units supplying electricity to industrial facilities that don&rsquo;t send a significant amount of power to the grid or other facilities may be able to make minor changes to their operating permits and be exempt from the program entirely.</p>

<p><em><u>Offsets</u></em>: Power plant units may also be able to reduce their need for allowances by offsetting their pollution with verifiable reductions from other projects. This could be capturing landfill methane, sequestering carbon through reforestation, avoiding methane through better agricultural practices, or&mdash;and this is particularly important in Pennsylvania&mdash;plugging abandoned oil and gas wells.</p>

<p><strong>Where do Companies get Allowances?</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, many electricity generators are going to need to obtain at least some allowances and, for that, the proposed rule sets up an auction program.</p>

<p>An auction program could be developed in several different ways, but the draft doesn&rsquo;t specify which would be prefered. Pennsylvania could provide a&nbsp; &ldquo;clearing price&rdquo; auction where participants submit sealed bids for the number of allowances they want and the price they will pay, and everyone pays the price in the lowest winning bid. It could also create a &ldquo;pay-as-bid&rdquo; auction where all the winners pay what they bid. Or, it could be a multi-round auction where participants can adjust their bidding strategy between rounds. The mechanics may differ, but the goal is to discover what the market thinks is a fair price for allowances rather than a &ldquo;command and control&rdquo; system where the DEP sets the price entirely on its own.</p>

<p>While DEP can run the auction entirely on its own, it also has the option of joining a multi-state market&mdash;like RGGI&mdash;if it determines that there is an appropriate market to join and the benefits outweigh the costs. It is expected they will. Economies of scale with a bigger market will reduce our share of the administrative and support costs, a multi-state market can lessen concerns about cross-border effects, and large markets can even lower the cost of compliance for participants. This is where RGGI comes into play. If we do join a multistate market, RGGI is the logical choice.</p>

<p><strong>Features of DEP&rsquo;s Proposal</strong></p>

<p><u><em>Guardrails Around Allowance Prices</em></u>:&nbsp;Preventing price shocks for consumers is always an important concern and spikes in fossil generation caused by severe weather could cause problems. Like all of the RGGI states, DEP proposes to mitigate this concern with a cost containment reserve (CCR). The CCR will make additional allowances available to keep costs down if the auction price is higher than a specified trigger price. On the other hand, unexpected retirements of polluting plants could make demand for allowances drop sharply. While lowering emissions is a good thing, a sharp fall in prices may make the program less effective at incentivising further emissions reductions. For that reason, DEP is proposing an emissions containment reserve (ECR). Similar to the CCR, the ECR would withhold allowances if the cost of reductions is much lower than expected.</p>

<p><u><em>Free Allowances for Waste Coal</em></u>:&nbsp;The proposal also uses free allowances as a policy tool. The draft program proposes to give away free allowances to further subsidize waste coal generators&rsquo; continued pollution. Waste coal proponents claim that they are providing an environmental service by cleaning up abandoned waste coal piles that are polluting our land and water. While burning these coal piles is one way of removing them, this proposal doesn&rsquo;t require the DEP to first determine that burning the coal is the best option available, it doesn&rsquo;t attempt to prioritize removal of the most problematic waste piles first, and it doesn&rsquo;t require any analysis to ensure the benefits these plants provide to justify the value of all the subsidies they are getting. This is a detail of the draft proposal that needs further attention by DEP moving forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Improvements DEP Should Consider</strong></p>

<p><u><em>Planning for retirement of waste coal generation</em></u>:&nbsp;If subsidies for waste coal remain part of the plan, more work should be done to plan for their eventual retirement. Currently, the proposed rule says that when sufficient waste coal retires for the set-aside to be reduced or eliminated, the allowances return to the auction pool. Because waste coal produces significantly more carbon pollution per megawatt-hour than the likely alternatives, this will add unneeded allowances to the market, depressing allowance prices, and making our carbon targets harder to reach. A better choice would be to retire these allowances from the auction pool entirely. If any allowances are returned to the auction pool, they should be discounted to reflect the fact replacement generation will likely be much cleaner.</p>

<p><u><em>Protecting Voluntary Purchases of Renewable Energy</em></u>:&nbsp;One set-aside DEP should consider adding to the draft rule is for voluntary purchases of renewable energy. Having a cap on carbon emissions is vital, but unless we are careful, a cap can also backfire and act as a carbon floor.&nbsp; If households or businesses choose to purchase clean renewable generation to fight air pollution and climate change, they want to ensure that they are getting real emissions reductions. As the rule is written, however, a voluntary purchase of clean generation leaves more room under the cap for others to buy more dirty power. DEP could fix this problem by keeping a pool of credits out of the auction and retire them for each ton of emissions avoided when individuals or businesses choose to buy clean renewable generation. Without this addition, the only way an individual could ensure they were making a difference is to not only buy clean energy but also buying the allowances. Making clean-energy consumers pay twice is the exact opposite of the polluter pays principle.</p>

<p><strong>What Happens Next?</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the most important regulatory actions we have seen during the current administration, and DEP&rsquo;s proposal is a good start, but there are still opportunities to make it better. For the next few months DEP will present their ideas and get input from various advisory committees before formally proposing the rule this summer.

National Gas Industry Plans to Spend Big to Advertise Mistruths in Western Pennsylvania,1/29/2020,"<p>Western Pennsylvania is about to be center stage in a new million-dollar public relations campaign spearheaded by the fracked gas industry&rsquo;s largest national lobbying group. But, as has been the case previously, the industry isn&rsquo;t telling the whole truth about its environmental impact and contributions to climate change.</p>

<p>The American Petroleum Institute <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/08/Oil-gas-industry-fracking-shale-drilling-Pittsburgh-messaging-campaign-pennsylvania/stories/202001080044"">recently announced that western Pennsylvania</a> will be one of several locations it will highlight as having benefited significantly from the extraction of fracked gas. The lobbying group will spend in excess of one million dollars on print and social media advertisements.</p>

<p>Specifically, the campaign is expected to hammer home a blatant mistruth consistently put forth by the industry: fracked gas is enhancing our environment, and the industry is doing its part to help combat the climate crisis.</p>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, API President and CEO Mike Sommers called fracking &ldquo;one of the most important environmental achievements in this country.&rdquo; He added that the fracked gas industry is &ldquo;stepping up to the plate to address the issue of climate change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only days later, <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/01/13/Range-Resources-DEP-order-methane-gas-leaking-Marcellus-well-Lewis-Lycoming/stories/202001130117"">another story appeared</a> in headlines that directly contradicts that assertion: a gas well drilled by Range Resources has been leaking gas into groundwater in central Pennsylvania for the last eight years. That&rsquo;s nearly 3,000 consecutive days of leakage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Protection has alleged that this single well &ldquo;caused methane gas to seep into 11 drinking water supplies, nearby streams and a farm field pocked with spots of dead grass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the last eight years, DEP regulators have been met with &ldquo;sporadic cooperation&rdquo; from Range Resources, which has refused to accept responsibility and is instead claiming that the methane is naturally occurring.</p>

<p>The DEP earlier this month finally ordered the company to fix the leaking well, noting that inaction from Range Resources will &ldquo;no longer be tolerated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as if this is an isolated incident. <a href=""https://www.fractracker.org/2020/01/fracking-in-pennsylvania-in-2019/"">According to a recent report</a>, during the most recent 12-month period for which data are available, the industry was cited for 13,833 violations in Pennsylvania. The most common violation involved failure in properly storing, transporting or disposing of residual waste, while the second most common violation concerned jeopardizing clean water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does that sound like an industry that is enhancing our environment? If you need more proof, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/climate/methane-leak-satellite.html"">look to another example</a> that came in February 2018, when a blowout at a single gas well in Ohio&mdash;about 70 miles southwest of Pittsburgh&mdash;resulted in more than 60 kilotons of methane escaping into the atmosphere over a 20-day period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To put it into perspective, this single incident resulted in more methane leaking into the atmosphere <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/ohio-exxon-mobil-methane-leak-satellite-climate-change/index.html"">than most countries release in an entire year</a>, all while the gas industry has worked with the Trump administration <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/climate/epa-methane-greenhouse-gas.html"">to roll back modest federal rules</a> that limit methane leaks in gas infrastructure. This doesn&rsquo;t sound like something an industry &ldquo;stepping up to the plate&rdquo; would do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still not convinced? This recent investigative report by Rolling Stone notes that <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/oil-gas-fracking-radioactive-investigation-937389/?fbclid=IwAR3dBg9Wz1bD2S_aGlPdI4R64hmuqUtkCzBym57_RY5YxeqWtI30AMKcsys"">oil and gas wells produce nearly a trillion gallons</a> of toxic waste per year. The author conducted hundreds of exhaustive interviews with scientists, regulators, industry workers and environmentalists, and he uncovered a &ldquo;sweeping arc of contamination&rdquo; to our environment, the public, and the industry&rsquo;s own employees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In trying to spin and change the narrative surrounding fracked gas, the industry touts the fact that its product is a cleaner alternative to coal, which is true. But that is a far cry from saying that fracked gas on its own is a solution to climate change. To the contrary, the buildout of natural gas infrastructure <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-14/emissions-set-to-jump-on-gas-fueled-industrial-boom-study-says"">could add as much as a half billion metric tons</a> per year of carbon emissions into our atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are dozens of other instances of <a href=""https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/fracking-and-health-2/"">claims of tainted water supplies</a>, of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-OMydfBGvk&amp;feature=youtu.be"">families who allege sickness</a> stemming from nearby fracked gas operations, and of <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/news/20190829/revolution-owners-fined-319000-for-pipeline-violations"">environmental damage to streams</a> and wetlands from drilling and pipeline operations.</p>

<p>In the coming months, you might see slick advertisements on television or expensive billboards along the highway. You might hear the upbeat radio ads or see glossy ads online.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The American Petroleum Institute is about to spend seven figures to try to convince Pennsylvanians that it is environmentally friendly and is addressing climate change. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

"The Dangers of Senate Bill 790, Part II",1/14/2020,"<p>In December, PennFuture Director of Policy Ezra Thrush&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Dangers-of-Senate-Bill-790"">wrote a blog detailing the dangers</a> of a new piece of legislation called Senate Bill 790. Legislators left Harrisburg for the holidays without voting on the bill but, in the coming days, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives is poised to vote on it, albeit in an amended form.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though it was recently amended in the House, Senate Bill 790 still represents&nbsp;a substantial rollback of environmental protections governing the conventional oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This bill, promoted by some legislators as a lifeline to the struggling conventional oil and gas industry, rolls back public health protections, allows for significant oil and gas spills to go unreported, and opens the door to more drilling operations across Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Other controversial provisions of the bill were amended earlier this week by the House Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committee, in an effort to garner more support from moderate Republicans and Democrats. A provision that would have allowed for drilling wastewater to be used as a road brine was eliminated, while thresholds for spill reporting were reduced.</p>

<p>The amended version of Senate Bill 790 is being touted in Harrisburg as an environmentally-sound compromise, but that&rsquo;s far from the truth. This remains a dangerous bill that would weaken environmental regulations on the oil and gas industry at a time when we need exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>This bill could receive second consideration in the House of Representatives this week, and could receive final consideration votes early next week. Gov. Tom Wolf has said he intends to veto the legislation if it reaches his desk, but PennFuture is working tirelessly to ensure this terrible legislation never makes it there.</p>

<p>You can do your part too, by contacting your local state representative and urging them to vote no on Senate Bill 790. Tell your elected leader that now is not the time to weaken regulations on the oil and gas industry.&nbsp;</p>

New rule attempts to tackle pollution from oil and gas wells,12/20/2019,"<p>On Jan. 19, 2016 Governor Tom Wolf <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-announces-new-methane-rules-to-improve-air-quality-reduce-industry-loss/"">announced a new strategy</a> to reduce the emissions of methane&mdash;a dangerous greenhouse gas&mdash;from the oil and natural gas industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2018, Governor Wolf and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) updated permits for new oil and natural gas operations to control for methane leakage. Unfortunately, between the Governor&rsquo;s announcement and the time these new permits were put in place, over 4,200 additional fracked gas wells were permitted. To control these wells and the tens of thousands of older existing sources, Governor Wolf announced the DEP would also &ldquo;expeditiously pursue the adoption of a regulation for existing sources.&rdquo; It might have taken nearly three years, but on Dec. 17, 2019, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Environmental Quality Board (EQB) voted to <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Air/Pages/Methane-Reduction-Strategy.aspx#.Vp6a0vkrJhE"">advance this proposed rulemaking.</a></p>

<p>While an important step, the proposed rulemaking still has some hurdles in the regulatory process before becoming law, but the rule also has some significant shortfalls. The DEP has presented the Environmental Quality Board with the regulatory language the agency would like to adopt along with supporting documentation and recommendations from various advisory committees, and the EQB has agreed to let the process move forward. While the rule&rsquo;s development process has been mostly internal within the DEP, we will see a notice in <a href=""http://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/"">the Pennsylvania Bulletin</a> early in 2020 which formally opens a public comment period. This will give the public the opportunity to weigh in with written comments and at public hearings.</p>

<p><u>Wait, the Rule Regulates VOC&rsquo;s and Not Methane?</u></p>

<p>As written, the rule specifically controls ozone-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by requiring thousands of existing facilities to adopt what is known as &ldquo;reasonably available control technology&rdquo; (RACT). In this case, RACT includes new standards for storage tanks and gas processing equipment along with requirements for leak detection and repair programs. While these are all specifically VOC controls, and methane is not a VOC under the <a href=""https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b77fd17146a534c225c8557b5ed4a469&amp;node=40:2.0.1.1.2.3.8.1&amp;rgn=div8"">Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s definitions</a>, the DEP predicts more than 75,000 tons of methane emissions will be avoided as a co-benefit of the program.&nbsp; Using VOC regulation as a surrogate to control methane may not be ideal, but it allowed the DEP to leverage work done at the federal level to establish Control Techniques Guidelines (CTGs) for these sources.</p>

<p><u>OK, So What Will the Environmental Impact of this Rule Be?</u></p>

<p>This rule will make the oil and gas production process a little cleaner, but it doesn&rsquo;t make the gas and petrochemical industry clean. Reducing 75,000 tons of methane a year won&rsquo;t fix the climate crisis alone, nor does it address all of the methane oil and gas operations are polluting into our atmosphere. In fact, the rule is only a small but necessary piece of what we need to do to cut greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change. At the rate our natural gas generation is expanding, even very conservative estimates suggest the industry will put all of that carbon pollution and more back in our air in a few short years. When we add even more pollution from sources like ethane cracker plants and other facilities, the window to see real reductions in carbon pollution from this rule gets even smaller. Pretending that we can drill our way to clean air and a healthy climate isn&rsquo;t the path forward.</p>

<p><u>How Can the Wolf Administration Make This Rule Stronger?</u></p>

<p>While the proposed rule is a positive step, more can be done to limit methane emissions.&nbsp; For example, the rule controls fugitive emissions by requiring qualifying wells to be inspected monthly by sight, sound, and smell and also quarterly using an instrument-based leak detection and repair (LDAR) systems such as infrared cameras and gas detectors that can identify and locate smaller leaks.&nbsp; Regularly checking for leaks isn&rsquo;t very difficult, but of the more than 71,000 conventional wells, the DEP estimates that all but 303 will be exempt from even this basic measure. Removing this exemption for low producing wells make sense&mdash;just because a well doesn&rsquo;t produce a lot of gas doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t have significant leaks.</p>

<p>The rule also weakens the LDAR provision by letting operators test less frequently if the initial testing does not find sufficient leaks.&nbsp; If a part wears out or breaks and a new leak develops, that could mean months of additional uncontrolled emissions before the problem is caught.&nbsp;The Department should correct this and require all sources conduct regular inspections for leaks.</p>

<p><u>It&rsquo;s Time to Act on Climate</u></p>

<p>Making this rule as strong as possible and finalizing it without delay is a step in the right direction, but we should expect opposition. Anti-environmental forces will work to weaken, delay, and de-fund these rules at the same time they are <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/News/PennFuture-Policy-Memo---EnergizePA---6-7-19DRAFT.pdf"">promoting increased subsidies for the oil and gas industry.</a> We believe the people of Pennsylvania want action on climate change and strong common-sense emission controls on polluting industries, but some people in Harrisburg clearly haven&rsquo;t heard that message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the new year, we&rsquo;ll be asking our members and friends to help fix that problem by sending in comments in support of a stronger rule and opposing attempts to increase pollution. But we also need to be realistic that making the oil and gas industry modestly cleaner, like the rule as currently written would do, won&rsquo;t solve the climate crisis. Much more needs to be done. Our elected officials have a constitutional obligation to take meaningful action in the fight against climate change and they need to hear from the public that we expect nothing less.</p>

The Dangers of Senate Bill 790,12/19/2019,"<p>As soon as the Chamber returns to legislative session in January, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives is poised to take up Senate Bill 790, an unprecedented rollback of environmental protections across the state. Our elected leaders must stand against this potentially devastating bill by voting against the bill.</p>

<p>The oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania, including conventional drillers, is prominent and extremely lucrative. The revenues, however, come at the cost of damaging our environment and health, and exacerbates our climate change concerns. According to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Health, there have been approximately 350,000 conventional oil and gas wells and roughly 10,000 unconventional oil and gas wells drilled across the Commonwealth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the overwhelmingly large gap between the two types of drilling, conventional oil and gas drilling has declined recently due to large investments and the production of much larger operations in unconventional drilling. SB 790, put forth by Senator Joe Scarnati, aims to revive the conventional industry, but at the expense of undoing years of regulations by reenacting the Oil and&nbsp;Gas Act of 1984. Conventional drilling advocates argue that their industry is different than those employing hydraulic fracturing methods in Pennsylvania, but there is no difference in spills and dirty water, whether&nbsp;caused by conventional or unconventional drilling industries.</p>

<p><u>Loosening Requirements for Industry While Putting Water at Risk</u></p>

<p>SB 790 capitulates to the oil and gas industry to help &ldquo;optimize&rdquo; Pennsylvania&rsquo;s natural resources for the industry&rsquo;s economic benefit. The bill encourages and promotes dirty energy usage in Pennsylvania and puts our water quality at risk. Though this threatens the future, the immediate effects on the environment and human health are far more troubling and outweigh the monetary and economic benefits it might bring. Generally, SB 790 loosens restrictions and facilitates a lack of accountability for the oil and natural gas industry.</p>

<p>For example, the bill allows up to 5 barrels of oil and up to 15 barrels of oil and gas water to be spilled and go unreported. This affects downstream users who are unaware that the spill even occurred.&nbsp;Moreover, SB 790 prohibits communities from creating more protective regulations to keep leaks and spills away from homes, schools, and other&nbsp;buildings, which is simply irresponsible.</p>

<p>One of the most concerning issues is with replacement water due to an unexpected spill, leak, or emergency.&nbsp;The tainted water must be replaced, but that water does not have to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act standards.&nbsp;This is a dangerous precedent as it allows for entities to pollute our state&rsquo;s precious water resources with unfiltered, dirty wastewater that is not safe for drinking or even swimming.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Toxicity Potential &amp; Health Impacts of Drilling Wastewater</u></p>

<p>This bill also allows for brine, or untreated wastewater, to be used as a dust suppressant on roads throughout Pennsylvania, which directly violates the Solid Waste Management Act, in which potentially toxic wastewater isn&rsquo;t allowed on roads. Excess brine runoff can easily make its way into waterways and systems for drinking water and recreational activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://extension.psu.edu/potential-health-impacts-of-oil-and-gas-wastewater-on-roads"">In a recent study</a>&nbsp;on the health impacts of oil and&nbsp;gas wastewater on roads, researchers at Penn State University found that there is a large potential to aquatic and human toxicity caused by the application of wastewater brine on roads.The study claimed that, &ldquo;Through a variety of experiments simulating (oil and gas)&nbsp;wastewater application to roads, followed by simulated rain events, the majority of contaminants were found not to be retained in the road. The high salt concentrations are likely the major potential threat to aquatic toxicity, requiring up to 1,600 times dilution to reach drinking water quality standards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Penn State researchers also disturbingly found that radium, a carcinogen from oil and&nbsp;gas wastewater, was found to leave the roads, impacting local watersheds. This wastewater is exempt from reporting, meaning the chemicals in the water do not have to be identified and can be kept confidential even when&nbsp;improperly disposed&nbsp;onto Pennsylvania land and water.&nbsp;SB 790 goes beyond that to specify that brine will no longer be defined as &ldquo;waste.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pennsylvania roads are already bombarded with enough salt to combat ice, and there is no need for Pennsylvania citizens to be exposed to more dangerous and toxic chemicals on our streets and in our water.</p>

<p><u>Stop Senate Bill 790</u></p>

<p>Currently, SB 790 is in the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, which is led by Republican Chairman Daryl Metcalfe. It is imperative that House members oppose Senate Bill 790. The conventional oil and&nbsp;gas industry should not have weaker rules for clean water protection, and rolling back regulations 35 years is obscene. We, as a state, have come too far and are too close to a brighter, cleaner future to roll back and roll over now.</p>

<p>Tell your State Representative to protect our water quality and <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/staterep_voteno_sb790"">OPPOSE Senate Bill 790 today.</a></p>

Facing the Frack: Gas is Not Enhancing our Environment,12/19/2019,"<p>The fracked gas industry and its proponents excel at spinning false narratives about the health and safety of its operations, and often don&rsquo;t tell the whole story when faced with facts.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, <a href=""https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/news/stories/2019/december/nicholas-muller-research-shale-gas.html"">a groundbreaking study</a>&nbsp;published&nbsp;by Carnegie Mellon University on Dec.&nbsp;8&nbsp;that found that for every three jobs created by the shale gas industry, someone&rsquo;s life in the region is&nbsp;cut short by a year because of associated pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While not addressing the study specifically, industry trade group Marcellus Shale Coalition <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2019/12/08/shale-development-natural-gas-drilling-fracking-costs-health-study-pennsylvania-cmu/stories/201912060038"">emailed a statement</a> to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, saying that &ldquo;we believe firmly&hellip;that natural gas is unquestionably enhancing our environment and air quality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not, and there is recent and ample evidence to prove so. Look at a headline that broke earlier this week to find the fallacy within that statement: in February 2018, a blowout at a single gas well in Ohio&mdash;about 70 miles southwest of Pittsburgh&mdash;resulted in more than 60 kilotons of methane escaping into the atmosphere over a 20 day period.</p>

<p>Methane, the colorless and odorless main component of fracked gas, is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas that can <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/climate/methane-leak-satellite.html"">warm the planet more than 80 times as much</a> as the same amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.&nbsp;It was a total disaster for the climate.</p>

<p>The massive leak in Ohio released about 120 metric tons of methane into the atmosphere per hour. The incident also forced about 100 residents to evacuate the area, residents who had previously complained about throat irritation, dizziness and other breathing problems.</p>

<p>To put it into perspective, this single incident resulted in more methane leaking into the atmosphere <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/ohio-exxon-mobil-methane-leak-satellite-climate-change/index.html"">than most countries release in an entire year.</a></p>

<p>The methane leak and its consequences are frightening enough, but what about the fact that it took nearly two years to uncover the scope of the incident? According to <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/climate/methane-leak-satellite.html"">the New York Times</a>, the scale only became known after an analysis was undertaken by a satellite specifically designed to monitor the planet for methane leaks.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s just one well. According to the Energy Information Administration, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/ohio-exxon-mobil-methane-leak-satellite-climate-change/index.html"">there are 991,000 oil and natural gas wells</a> in the United States, in addition to an <a href=""https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/proposed-methane-emissions-rule-passes-pennsylvania-environmental-quality-board/"">estimated 80,000 conventional oil and gas wells </a>and about 10,651 active unconventional gas wells in Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p>Groups like the Marcellus Shale Coalition can make statements about fracked gas enhancing our environment because, compared to coal, fracked gas is a cleaner option. It&#39;s true fracked gas burns much cleaner than coal and produces <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/climate/methane-leak-satellite.html"">only about half the carbon dioxide</a> than coal does.</p>

<p>That one fact, however, doesn&rsquo;t give the industry license to peddle its product as safe or clean. Carbon dioxide isn&rsquo;t the only greenhouse gas destroying our climate, and burning fossil fuels for electricity isn&rsquo;t the only way for greenhouse gases to enter the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What about the tons and tons of methane that escape&nbsp;undetected from the hundreds of thousands of oil and gas wells across the country? What about the health effects of living next to natural gas infrastructure that pollutes our air and water?</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/12/17/Pennsylvania-DEP-methane-VOC-rule-existing-oil-and-gas-wells-Marcellus-shale/stories/201912170126"">New rules and regulations are advancing</a> in Pennsylvania&mdash;the country&rsquo;s second-largest natural gas producer&mdash;to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds from oil and gas operations statewide. It&rsquo;s been estimated the regulations could help cut methane emissions by about 75,000 tons a year.</p>

<p>If this rule is enacted, it could make the gas and petrochemical industries marginally cleaner, but it most certainly will not make them clean. &ldquo;Cleaner than coal&rdquo; does not mean natural gas is clean or sustainable. It is neither,&nbsp;and propagating that narrative is intentional misdirection that fails to tell the entire story.</p>

<p>In the past two weeks, we&rsquo;ve been presented with evidence that lifespans in western Pennsylvania are being cut short because of the fracked gas industry, while we were also presented with evidence that 60 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere as part of a single incident.</p>

<p>Does that sound like an industry that is enhancing our environment and improving our air quality?</p>

GivingTuesday a big success for PennFuture,12/16/2019,"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The holidays are for giving.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We give because it makes us feel good. Whether you celebrate Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa, the winter solstice, or something else during these cold, dark days, we are all celebrating our community and sharing gratitude with our loved ones at the end of the year.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And what better way to kick off&nbsp;these celebrations than with&nbsp;a new holiday: the day we celebrate giving&mdash;GivingTuesday, which took place on December 3rd. Seven years ago, the GivingTuesday movement was born on social media as part as the non-profit community&rsquo;s response to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and has now become the &ldquo;start date&rdquo; for the end of year holiday giving season. This global day of giving has become the biggest giving day of the year.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This year PennFuture had a goal of raising $10,000 for GivingTuesday while encouraging new donors. We got <em>really</em> close, raising $9,532.49 in 24 hours! Part of that included a match of $4,690 from GivingTuesday donors from last year, which we surpassed! Thanks to your donations, PennFuture&rsquo;s GivingTuesday Challenge Match was a success. What is most exciting is that of the 83 donors who gave on that day, 25 of them were new donors!&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What a great start to our end of year giving campaign! These new donors are also new members, and the more members we have the more attention our elected leaders must pay to us.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you didn&#39;t get a chance to donate on GivingTuesday, it&#39;s okay! There is still plenty of time to make your 2019 donation this season and keep your membership active. GivingTuesday is a wonderful day of celebrating philanthropy and the work so many great charities do. But really, it is just one day. PennFuture&#39;s work goes on all year long because environmental watchdogs never sleep! And that&#39;s what we are, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s watchdog for clean air, pure water, and a healthy climate.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
PennFuture is leading the transition to a clean energy economy in Pennsylvania and beyond. With your support we are protecting our air, water and land, and empowering citizens to build sustainable communities for future generations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I can&rsquo;t think about giving at the holidays without thinking about the famous literary character Ebenezer Scrooge. It is through charitable giving that Scrooge understands the meaning of the holiday. He gave because it made him feel as light as a feather, happy as an angel, merry as a schoolboy. He gave because it made him feel good.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I hope you feel just as good this year.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On behalf of us all at PennFuture, I thank you for your giving&nbsp;and wish you peace, love, and joy during this wonderful holiday season, and a happy new year!</p>

<ul>
	<li>2019 was the Year of our Climate Youth, and we are grateful every day for their bold activism and ambition.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>2019 was the year that the stakes in the fight to stop Pennsylvania&rsquo;s blind embrace of gas for energy and petrochemicals rose to new heights. Words were spoken, sides were taken, industry plans were exposed, and the public noticed.</li>

But I will boast on a few highlights in 2019 where our organizational signature of excellence is shining through.</p>

<p>On October 19, Governor Tom Wolf issued an important climate-related executive order, beginning a 24-month regulatory process that will lead to a cap on carbon pollution in Pennsylvania and our participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) market.&nbsp;PennFuture&rsquo;s Energy Center Director Rob Altenburg <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2019/09/25/Rob-Altenburg-Pennsylvania-should-join-the-Regional-Greenhouse-Gas-Initiative-but-for-the-right-reasons/stories/201909250048"">has been front and center</a> in keeping the public informed on what RGGI is about and how it can help address climate pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gas industry&rsquo;s response to Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto&rsquo;s remarks opposing a petrochemical buildout has been loud, monied and consistent. PennFuture&rsquo;s Media Relations Director Jared Stonesifer has launched a rapid response blog to bust myths propagated by the industry and its spokespeople. You can <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fallacy-Fiction-and-Falsehoods"">have a look here</a>.</p>

<p>Through a unique partnership with students at Vermont Law School&rsquo;s Environmental Advocacy Clinic, PennFuture is suing industrial polluters who are violating clean water laws along the Delaware River. Our focus on protecting the exceptional value headwaters of the river continues as we watchdog energy and transportation projects that stand to adversely impact the best water quality in our state. In addition, we are in litigation against the Environmental Protection Agency for failure to set coal oven standards in a timely manner. This exceptional work advances under the leadership of our senior attorneys Alice Baker and Abby Jones.</p>

<p>Following the lineage of our successful high profile advertising campaigns Toxic Neighbor (targeting perpetual air quality violations at U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Clairton Coke Works) and Our Pocono Waters (targeting misguided development that will impact Pocono headwaters), we launched our Keep Philly Green &amp; Water Clean campaign, drawing attention to green stormwater management and the open space, public health, recreational and habitat benefits it provides, and we are encouraging the city of Philadelphia to remain a national leader with these programs.</p>

<p>Our Clean Energy Pittsburgh campaign is endeavoring to bring clean energy to Wilkinsburg, Swissvale and Braddock. These campaigns all take place under the leadership of staff including Jay Andrews, Lena Smith, Emily Baldauff, Annie Regan and Kelsey Krepps.</p>

<p>This year of 2019 produced a new strategic plan for the organization, under the leadership of our Vice President and Chief of Staff Matt Stepp. PennFuture has a different voice and will unapologetically champion a better future for Pennsylvania, one where the rights guaranteed by our environmental rights amendment prevail over the pollution of our people and natural resources. There is much work to do.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I am looking forward to in 2020:</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s Civic Engagement program will be front and center in counties all over the state as we organize volunteers, work on non-partisan voter registration and get out the vote efforts.&nbsp;Staff including Josh McNeil and Mike Mehrazar will be very, very busy.&nbsp;PennFuture&rsquo;s reach will extend into new places including Erie, Lehigh and Bucks counties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our state legislature will be back in session, struggling to govern and do the will of the people.&nbsp;All eyes will be on the so-called Energize package of bills that propose to subsidize petrochemical infrastructure and manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s policy director Ezra Thrush will be focused on that and stopping the constant onslaught of attempts to roll back regulations that protect public health and our environment. On the positive side of possibilities, there is renewed interest in electric vehicle support infrastructure and community energy proposals that have a decent chance of success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We earnestly hope the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day will reset and re-invigorate the environmental movement and the day will turn out diverse and intergenerational peoples bringing a clarion call to elected officials: the peoples of the earth deserve a future,&nbsp;the time has come to act boldly on climate.</p>

<p>Finally, on November 3, 2020 the United States will elect its next president. If you make no other New Year resolution, make sure everyone you know who is eligible to vote is registered, and make sure they vote on Election Day. We must cast votes on behalf of our environment and our earth, and if we do, next year at this time, our hope for the future and our planet will be renewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Writer&rsquo;s note: PennFuture&#39;s staff consists of dedicated professionals&nbsp; - too numerous to all mention here - who have excellent and important skills.&nbsp; We are governed by a dedicated Board of Directors and advised by members of our President&rsquo;s Leadership Council.</em></p>

<p><u><strong>Introduction and Context</strong></u></p>

<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto <a href=""https://www.nextpittsburgh.com/features/i-oppose-any-additional-petrochemical-companies-heres-what-mayor-peduto-said-at-the-climate-action-summit/"">ignited a firestorm</a> in late October when he voiced opposition to further expansion of the petrochemical industry in western Pennsylvania. The mayor&rsquo;s stance kicked off <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2019/11/27/the-plastics-debate-heats-up-both-sides-are.html?ana=wpxi"">a heated debate</a> that has unfolded between local and state politicians, business leaders and citizens about the future not just of western Pennsylvania but the entire state.</p>

<p>The debate reached <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/in-radio-interview-wolf-breaks-with-pittsburghs-peduto-on-nat-gas-enraging-environmentalists/"">as far as Gov. Tom Wolf</a>, who sided with Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald in supporting the industry and its expansion. A letter <a href=""https://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/news/20191120/county-leaders-petrochemical-industry-welcome-in-western-pennsylvania"">signed by 20 regional elected officials</a> circulated in support of the industry, while one state representative <a href=""https://www.pahouse.com/Burns/InTheNews/NewsRelease/?id=111632"">petitioned ExxonMobil to scout</a> his district for a potential ethane cracker plant.</p>

<p>These letters, press releases and public statements continue to make assertions that are misleading and serve only as industry talking points to further the goal of turning Pennsylvania into the next petrochemical hub.</p>

<p><strong>Myth: The petrochemical industry is Pennsylvania&rsquo;s &ldquo;lifeline to the future.&rdquo;</strong> In a letter signed by <a href=""https://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/news/20191120/county-leaders-petrochemical-industry-welcome-in-western-pennsylvania"">more than 20 regional elected officials</a>&mdash;including Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and 16 county commissioners from western Pennsylvania&mdash;it was stated that the fracked gas industry has &ldquo;breathed life back into our communities&rdquo; and that the petrochemical industry is our &ldquo;lifeline to the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Fact: The petrochemical industry, even if built to capacity, will have a negligible impact on regional employment.</strong> Shell&rsquo;s cracker plant in Beaver County is expected to employ <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/06/20/petrochemical-Appalachian-Shell-cracker-promoter-Washington-jobs-DOE-Ohio/stories/201906200133"">roughly 500 people</a> once the plant is operational, meaning jobs at the cracker plant will represent less than 1 percent of the county&rsquo;s workforce of <a href=""https://www.workstats.dli.pa.gov/Documents/County%20Profiles/Beaver%20County.pdf"">more than 81,000 people.</a></p>

<p>By comparison, <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/pennsylvania.htm#eag"">more than 6.2 million people</a> are employed in Pennsylvania, meaning that full employment at the cracker plant represents less than&nbsp;0.01 percent of the state&rsquo;s employed workforce.</p>

<p><strong>Myth: The future success of western Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy relies on petrochemicals</strong>. In a recent interview <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2019/11/27/the-plastics-debate-heats-up-both-sides-are.html?ana=wpxi"">with the Pittsburgh Business Times</a>, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said elected officials &ldquo;need to be reasonable and realistic in where the future lies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Fact: Employment in the clean energy sector is already driving Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy without the help of state taxpayer subsidies</strong>. There are more than 90,000 people employed in the clean energy sector in Pennsylvania, <a href=""https://www.e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-pennsylvania-2019/"">according to a 2019 economic analysis</a>, and the sector is adding jobs five times faster than the overall state employment growth rate. Since 2014, the clean energy industry has increased employment in Pennsylvania by nearly 60 percent, putting the state nearly into the top 10 nationally in total employment in clean energy.</p>

<p>Despite that, state lawmakers <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/08/13/Shell-cracker-Trump-protesters-plastics-ethane-oil-gas-Beaver-EPA-regulations-pennsylvania/stories/201908130059"">handed out $1.6 billion in tax</a><a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/08/13/Shell-cracker-Trump-protesters-plastics-ethane-oil-gas-Beaver-EPA-regulations-pennsylvania/stories/201908130059"">&nbsp;breaks</a>&nbsp;for Shell to build a petrochemical facility in Beaver County. That&rsquo;s equivalent to more than $3&nbsp;million for each of the 500 permanent jobs at the plant&mdash;an enormous giveaway to one of the biggest and more profitable corporations on the planet. Compare this further to the state of New York, where leaders in 2018 committed $1.5 billion <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/new-york-to-invest-1-5-billion-in-renewable-energy-projects"">to create 40,000 renewable energy jobs</a> in the state, about $37,500 per job.</p>

<p><strong>Myth: If Pennsylvania becomes the next petrochemical hub, ordinary residents will benefit</strong>. In early December, <a href=""https://www.pahouse.com/Burns/InTheNews/NewsRelease/?id=111632"">State Rep. Frank Burns (D-Cambria County) sent a letter</a> to the chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, asking the company to scout Cambria County as a location for a new cracker plant. In his letter, Burns said he wants to &ldquo;make a deal that benefits both ExxonMobil and the hardworking residents of our region.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Fact: Industry will be the only winner if Pennsylvania becomes the next petrochemical hub.</strong> Ask the residents of Port Neches, Texas about the benefits of the petrochemical industry. A chemical plant there <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-chemical-plant-blasts-50000-people-allowed-back-home-2019-11-30/"">exploded before Thanksgiving</a>, displacing 50,000 residents after a four-mile evacuation radius was implemented. That incident was only the latest in a series of mishaps and accidents in the region of the Gulf Coast <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cancer-alley-reserve-louisiana-denka-plant-health-risk-higher-national-average-2019-07-24/"">known as &ldquo;Cancer Alley.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>The health impacts of the Shell cracker plant alone are enough to warrant deep concerns: the plant will emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, which is equivalent to putting nearly a half million more cars on local roads annually. It will also emit three times as much pollution as the Clairton Coke Works, which is Allegheny County&rsquo;s largest source of pollution. Allegheny County already has <a href=""https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/msas/pittsburgh-new-castle-weirton-pa-oh-wv.html#pm24"">some of the worst air quality in the country</a>, and has previously ranked <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/plastics-appalachia-next-cancer-alley-fracking-public-health-ethane"">in the top 2 percent for cancer risks</a> from air pollution. Shell&rsquo;s plant alone will erase 30 years of improved air quality.</p>

<p>If Rep. Burns wants Pennsylvania to be the next petrochemical cluster, he should look at the health impacts of Cancer Alley, a place where <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/louisiana-cancer-alley-getting-more-toxic-905534/"">7 of the 10 census tracts with the highest cancer risks</a> in the country are located. In addition, Louisiana residents <a href=""https://law.tulane.edu/sites/law.tulane.edu/files/files/Cancer%20Fact%20Sheet%202019%20FINAL.pdf"">have a 15 percent higher cancer death rate</a> compared to the rest of the country.</p>

<p>Communities in Burns&rsquo; district are still reeling from the environmental degradation wrought by the coal and steel industries. It would be an insult to injury to allow their health and communities to be further defiled by petrochemicals.&nbsp;</p>

Legislators say Gov. Wolf lacks the authority to have Pennsylvania join RGGI. This is why they’re wrong.,11/22/2019,"<p>Earlier this week, a group of state legislators held a press conference in Harrisburg to unveil new legislation that challenges Gov. Tom Wolf&rsquo;s authority to enter into a partnership like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).&nbsp;</p>

<p>These bills&mdash;Senate Bill 950 and House Bill 2025&mdash;make the outlandish claim that &ldquo;no statutory or constitutional authority currently exists that authorizes a State agency to regulate or impose a tax on carbon dioxide emissions.&rdquo; This is simply wrong and misleading.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Constitution is clear saying that our &ldquo;public natural resources are the common property of all the people&rdquo; and that the Commonwealth act as trustee to &ldquo;conserve and maintain&rdquo; those resources. The real constitutional question is not whether the Commonwealth may act, but how any legislator could justify that allowing polluting industries to dump their waste products into our air for free is in keeping with their duty to conserve natural resources for our benefit.</p>

<p>There is also explicit statutory authority to regulate carbon pollution. The Air Pollution Control Act (APCA) gives the Environmental Quality Board&mdash;the organization that promulgates environmental regulations in Pennsylvania&mdash;the power and the duty to &ldquo;[e]stablish and publish maximum quantities of air contaminants that may be permitted under various conditions at the point of use from any air contaminant source in various areas of the Commonwealth so as to control air pollution.&rdquo; That is, essentially, what Governor Wolf&rsquo;s Executive order requires. The fact that the rule will have a market-based component allows more flexibility for the regulated community, lowers compliance costs, and can generate revenue that can be invested in complementary programs, but the core of the program is a cap on carbon emissions.</p>

<p>Attempts to characterize compliance costs as a tax versus a fee is a strawman argument when, in reality, Governor Wolf&rsquo;s Executive Order doesn&rsquo;t expressly require either. The executive order only says that the proposed regulation will &ldquo;provide for the annual or more frequent auction of carbon dioxide emissions allowances through a market-based mechanism&rdquo; and that such allowances &ldquo;may be traded with holders of allowances from other states.&rdquo; The legislature could pass bills allowing for more options in how any auction revenue is expended, but even without legislation the DEP has the ability to collect emission fees and use them for certain purposes.</p>

<p>These bills are equally outlandish when they say &ldquo;no statute...authorizes the [administration] to adopt regulations, implement a policy or take any other action to authorize the Commonwealth to join or participate in a State or regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, APCA clearly states that the Department of Environmental Protection may &ldquo;[c]ooperate with the appropriate agencies of the United States or of other states or any interstate agencies with respect to the control, prevention, abatement and reduction of air pollution,&rdquo; and this would be the latest of several cap-and-trade systems the DEP has implemented.</p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Protection has used market-based programs to control emissions a number of times, and we expect that experience will be reflected in their proposed regulation. &#8203;The Legislature attempting to delay the process with this legislation serves no purpose but to increase pollution.</p>

A Trip to the Supreme Court,11/13/2019,"<p>Until last week, I had never been to the Supreme Court of the United States. But an issue that I have been interested in for years had wound its way through the lower courts and was being heard in the highest court in our land, and I wanted to hear it. So, the evening before the argument, I took a train from our Philadelphia offices to Washington, D.C., had an enjoyable evening with family, and went to bed with my alarm clock set for 5:15 a.m.</p>

<p>I got up in the morning, put on my suit, and headed to the Supreme Court arriving by 5:45 a.m. Even then, I was 80th in line! As it gradually got lighter and the morning joggers ran past, the line grew longer and longer. A little before 9 a.m., the first fifty people in line were let into the building and the rest of us remained waiting outside. If no one else was leaving, I wasn&rsquo;t either. At 9:45 a.m., a few more people were allowed in, and ten minutes later a few more. I was now close to the head of the line&mdash;two, maybe three people in front of me.</p>

<p>Then, we were told there were no more seats. The disappointment was frustrating, but we were told if we still wanted to go inside, we could enter for three minutes. After waiting for over four hours, I was going into the court, even if just for three minutes. We passed through security, locked our coats and bags in a locker, went through more security and waited outside the doors to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Then, one of the marshals said: &ldquo;We have some extra seats, do you want to stay for the whole argument?&rdquo; Of course I did! And just like that, I was in.</p>

<p>The case I heard was <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/18-260.html""><em>County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund</em></a>, in which the Court seeks to answer the question of whether the Clean Water Act requires a permit when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters by a nonpoint source, such as groundwater. Generally, the Clean Water Act requires a permit for the addition to the nation&rsquo;s waters of any pollutant that comes &ldquo;from any point source.&rdquo; The statute defines a point source broadly including &ldquo;any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance.&rdquo; &nbsp;Over the years, what constitutes a pollutant, a point source, and navigable waters have been the subjects of substantial litigation. This was a case I&rsquo;d been waiting for since it was first filed seven years ago.</p>

<p>In this case, the County of Maui injects its treated wastewater from its sewage treatment plant underground into wells, which flows into the groundwater under the facility. The wastewater then travels through the groundwater to the Pacific Ocean a half-mile away. The County of Maui has never had a Clean Water Act permit for its discharges, although it has always known that pollutants from its wells reach the ocean. It has understood that it was subject to the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s nonpoint source management program, which is largely left to the states to implement.</p>

<p>Several environmental groups alleged in a citizen suit that the County&rsquo;s unpermitted discharges of pollutants violated the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s prohibition of polluting without a permit. The U.S District Court for the District of Hawaii agreed. Interestingly, the court found that both the wells that &ldquo;indirectly discharge a pollutant into the ocean through a groundwater conduit&rdquo; as well as the groundwater itself were point sources.</p>

<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed the lower court&rsquo;s decision, holding that a permit was required because the &ldquo;pollutants are fairly traceable from the point source to a navigable water such that the discharge is the functional equivalent of a discharge into the navigable water&rdquo; and &ldquo;the pollutant levels reaching navigable water are more than&nbsp;de minimis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When this case was argued in front of the Supreme Court last week, everyone seemed to realize just how much was on the line. Both sides warned of the extreme consequences should the Supreme Court rule against them. The County of Maui argued&nbsp;that a ruling that its discharges require a permit may subject millions of pollutant sources across the country (potentially even small individual households) to the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s permitting requirement for the first time.</p>

<p>Conversely, the environmental groups argued that finding that intervening groundwater eliminates Clean Water Act point source liability would allow polluters to construct a &ldquo;work around&rdquo; to Clean Water Act permitting by directing their pipes into groundwater or cutting off the pipes just a few feet inland of a navigable water. The Supreme Court Justices really seemed to understand both the facts of the case and the potential real-life implications of their decision. They sought, as Justice Breyer said, &ldquo;a standard that will prevent evasion . . . and at the same time doesn&rsquo;t . . . undercut the groundwater program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With all this, I am glad to live in a state that requires permits for discharges of pollutants regardless of whether it is to surface water or groundwater. Under the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, &ldquo;waters of the Commonwealth&rdquo; covers both surface and groundwaters, such that polluters don&rsquo;t have the option to evade permitting by discharging to groundwater or cutting a pipe short of discharging to waters of the Commonwealth. Ensuring these permits protect our natural resources and are enforced is what we do at PennFuture.</p>

Making Sense of Pennsylvania’s Growing Debate Around Petrochemicals,11/12/2019,"<p>When Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto <a href=""https://www.publicsource.org/peduto-speaks-out-publicly-for-the-first-time-against-a-petrochemical-expansion-in-western-pennsylvania/"">announced his opposition</a> late last month to any more petrochemical companies in western Pennsylvania at the Climate Action Summit, I might have been the second person in the audience to rise up and out of my chair to applaud in appreciation and agreement. Advocates and constituents alike have been yearning for an elected leader to call attention to a growing problem: Pennsylvania&rsquo;s proposed petrochemical buildout is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and bad for our communities.</p>

<p>Mayor Peduto followed his statement of opposition with powerful food for thought: Who was at the table&mdash;and who was not&mdash;when decisions were being made to lay the groundwork for the Royal Dutch Shell cracker plant in Beaver County? Who&rsquo;s at the table on <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/post/report-exxonmobil-scouting-property-2nd-cracker-plant-beaver-county#stream/0"">where Exxon will build</a> a second plant? Where the industry wants to build a plant in northeast Pennsylvania? Mayor Peduto makes an important suggestion: the region (and in our opinion the state) should reopen its planning for a massive buildout of a three-state Appalachian Petrochemical Storage Hub, and that those plans be the subject to a much more inclusive regional, state, and public dialogue. Otherwise, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s politicians and business leaders are taking the state down a troubling economic and environmental path with little to no discussion.</p>

<p><u>Questioning Pennsylvania&#39;s&nbsp;Petrochemical Buildout is Leadership Against Doublespeak</u></p>

<p>Mayor Peduto&rsquo;s comments show significant leadership. Consider alone the transit of air, water, <a href=""https://www.wtae.com/article/investigation-cracker-plant-will-bring-jobs-pollution/27424034"">and climate pollution</a> that will emanate from the cracker plant. The suggestion becomes even more relevant in light of increasing expressions of concern <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2016/12/12/On-the-fenceline-and-on-the-fence-about-Shell-cracker-plant-pennsylvania-beaver-county/stories/201612120024"">from the frontline communities</a> and families that have been impacted by failing pipeline construction and property value impacts. Rural and urban residents alike simply want a future and livelihood that doesn&rsquo;t come with an unhealthy and fouled environmental price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plenty of voters support Mayor Peduto&rsquo;s stance, but his statements were met with outrage and opposition from politicians and industry cheerleaders who lack the courage to buck the will and dominance of the so-called fracked gas and petrochemical industries. There is a disturbing refusal among many elected officials and captains of industry to embrace the changes needed to address climate change and the sustainable industries, jobs, and profits that will grow out of it. Fracked gas and petrochemicals will not be major economic players of a climate-stabilizing future, yet the region and state stubbornly lean into climate-killing industries in a way that is not only intellectually dishonest, but also funnels billions in taxpayer subsidies to help the shareholders and CEO&rsquo;s of petrochemical companies make a profit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a pervasive problem in Pennsylvania: our elected leaders talk out of both sides of their mouths. Self-identified, climate-aware leaders like Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and Governor Tom Wolf repeatedly say that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s fracked gas can be extracted and exploited&nbsp;safely. On Nov. 12, <a href=""https://kdkaradio.radio.com/media/audio-channel/future-energy-and-shell-cracker-plantnew-voting-laws-governor-pennsylvania-tom"">Wolf gave an interview</a> in which he publicly disagreed with Peduto&rsquo;s stance and said Shell&rsquo;s cracker plant is part of an &ldquo;energy efficient future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wolf and others follow these statements with a belief that Pennsylvania can also be part of the climate solution. There is a mountain of science, models, and experts that say otherwise. It&rsquo;s the work of organizations like PennFuture to expose the duality of these views and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Fallacy-Fiction-and-Falsehoods"">get the facts out about the fallacies</a> behind them, and help the public unravel these confusing statements.</p>

<p><u>The Petrochemical Buildout is a Statewide Problem</u></p>

<p>Heading up a statewide environmental advocacy organization requires that I keep an eye on the whole of our state. As such, I feel it is important to note&nbsp;that the attempt to elevate Pennsylvania as a world petrochemical power is not just confined to western Pennsylvania. It&rsquo;s intricately connected to pipelines in the southern tier counties, petrochemical projects in northeast Pennsylvania, existing plastics manufacturers in Erie, and along the Susquehanna River, among other existing infrastructure.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this large scale buildout has flown under the radar. So much of the fracked gas and petrochemical industry&rsquo;s success depends on cultivating elected officials with campaign contributions and other goodies. The industry relies on its access to elected officials to get preferential treatment without the complication of public debate. The industries rely on public relations machines to hammer opposing viewpoints, like that of Mayor Peduto, at a moment&rsquo;s notice. This machine churns out messaging packaged for ease of use by the petrochemical industry&#39;s surrogates in government and powerful economic development circles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I fear the spread of petrochemicals in Pennsylvania is becoming unstoppable. Projects are pervasive. Along the Susquehanna River, New Fortress Energy is <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/About/Regional/North-central-Regional-Office/Community-Information/Pages/New-Fortress-Energy.aspx"">constructing a Liquefied Natural Gas facility</a> in Wyalusing, Bradford County.&nbsp;Caithness Energy cut ribbon on its gas fired power plant in Salem Township&mdash;the Moxie Freedom Generating Plant&mdash;along the river in Luzerne County. Elsewhere, the only compressor station along the PennEast Pipeline is moving ahead in Kidder Township, Carbon County, in close proximity the Pocono&rsquo;s Hickory Run State Park and tributaries to the Lehigh River.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the help of elected officials, the gas industry is loosening the ground for another possible fracked gas and petrochemical hub in Northeast Pennsylvania. Reminiscent of the exclusionary conversations suggested by Mayor Peduto, <a href=""http://www.thinkaboutbriefing.com/"">a closed door meeting</a> of business leaders (Cabot Oil &amp; Gas, CAN DO, Greater Hazleton Chamber of Commerce, Northeast Pennsylvania Manufacturers and Employers Association, UGI Energy Services) and elected officials (Sen. John Yudichak, Speaker Mike Turzai, Rep. Aaron Kaufer, and Rep. Tara Toohil) recently held in Luzerne County mulling over a wish list of site specifications, subsidies, and regulatory rollbacks that would be needed for Northeast Pennsylvania to become home to another cracker plant like Royal Dutch Shell&rsquo;s 900-acre industrial behemoth in Beaver County.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shortly after the meeting, Sen. Yudichak <a href=""https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/opinion/2019/11/to-help-working-class-democrats-must-recognize-value-of-low-cost-energy-opinion.html"">published an </a><a href=""http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/opinion/2019/11/to-help-working-class-democrats-must-recognize-value-of-low-cost-energy-opinion.html"">op-ed</a>&nbsp;aimed at sowing confusion, arguing that building out more fracked gas and petrochemical infrastructure is the right thing to do for the environment and electricity reliability. While carbon pollution from the electric generation sector has reduced slightly because gas has replaced coal, that trend will not continue. As the few large coal-fired power plants left in Pennsylvania rapidly approach retirement, we are now seeing most of the pollution come from gas plants. That is bad today, but in a few short years we could see more than 70 percent of our generation coming from gas. That not only means much more pollution, but putting all our eggs in one basket is terrible for reliability. Worse yet, gas plants are dependent on the relatively fragile infrastructure of our pipeline system and, when disruptions inevitably happen, municipal gas systems will have a higher priority to receive fuel.</p>

<p><u>Pennsylvania Needs Leadership, Not Lackeys</u></p>

<p>Elected officials and business leaders have the right to their opinions, but as they govern and lead, they owe the people a level playing field, and they owe others with differing viewpoints respect. They do not have the right to negotiate an unsustainable future behind closed doors, spread misinformation and toe industry lines, or be close-minded to alternative and diversified economic development like that being embraced in our neighboring states. They also don&rsquo;t have the right to misdirect, misinform, and confuse what little direction they&rsquo;re providing their constituents at a crucial moment in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economic history. The decisions made in the ensuing years will dictate the next 50 years of environmental outcomes.

"Fallacy, Fiction and Falsehoods: Debunking the Petrochemical Industry Part 1",11/4/2019,"<p><em>Note: This is the first in an ongoing series of blogs taking a deeper look at the comments, misinformation, hyperbole, and criticisms from the natural gas and petrochemical industry as well as their allies in their attempt to sell Pennsylvanians on the virtues of its climate-killing sector. As we&rsquo;ve seen in other states, the industry often uses misinformation tactics to sow doubt, build political support, and put a wedge in public debate. These blogs will provide an easily digestible point/counterpoint to some of the most prominent statements, quotes, and attacks.</em></p>

<p><strong><u>Introduction and Context</u></strong></p>

<p>Speaking at the Climate Action Summit in downtown Pittsburgh on Oct. 30, 2019, <a href=""https://www.nextpittsburgh.com/features/i-oppose-any-additional-petrochemical-companies-heres-what-mayor-peduto-said-at-the-climate-action-summit/"">Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto announced</a> he would not support any further petrochemical development in western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The mayor&rsquo;s comments surprised environmentalists and industry supporters alike, albeit for different reasons. In the hours that followed his remarks, Peduto was subjected to harsh criticisms and attacks from those who have a very different vision for the future of western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that emotions are running so high. What&rsquo;s at stake is no less than the very future of millions of people. Pennsylvania is already home to one ethane cracker plant and could soon be home to another, as it was announced earlier this month that <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/post/report-exxonmobil-scouting-property-2nd-cracker-plant-beaver-county#stream/0"">ExxonMobil is scouting for land in the area.</a> The next few months and years will shape the landscape &ndash; both economic and geographic &ndash; for decades to come.</p>

<p>Some of the statements issued last week in opposition to the mayor&#39;s remarks&nbsp;are at best ignorant and, at worst, intentionally false.</p>

<p><strong>Point: Building out natural gas and petrochemicals provides Pennsylvania both economic growth and a clean environment.</strong> David Spigelmyer, the president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, stated that &ldquo;clean and abundant American natural gas is enabling economic growth or environmental progress for every single Pennsylvanian.&rdquo; He went on to say that some politicians &ldquo;push extreme or fringe bans on responsible energy development.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint: Neither gas or petrochemicals is clean, rather both are and can make profound impacts on our environment.</strong> Pointing out their impacts is neither extreme or fringe. It is disingenuous to suggest there is anything &ldquo;clean&rdquo; about natural gas. Nothing about the extraction process&mdash;fracking, spills and leaks&mdash;is <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/natural-gas-carbon-pollution-climate-change-20190708.html"">clean or sustainable for our communities or our environment</a>, and the methane that leaks during natural gas development and processing is <a href=""https://blogs.princeton.edu/research/2014/03/26/a-more-potent-greenhouse-gas-than-co2-methane-emissions-will-leap-as-earth-warms-nature/"">30 times more potent as a greenhouse gas</a> than carbon dioxide. Methane is <a href=""https://unfccc.int/news/new-methane-signs-underline-urgency-to-reverse-emissions"">one of the major contributors</a> to climate change.</p>

<p>A final point on Spigelmyer&rsquo;s statement: there is nothing &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; or &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; about standing up and fighting for clean air and clean water. Pennsylvanians have a constitutional right to both and western Pennsylvania has a long history of environmental damage borne from industry. The mayor&rsquo;s comments reflect on this history and the public health and environmental damage caused by the coal and steel industry. It&rsquo;s fair to question allowing another well known polluting industry access to the region, particularly after <a href=""http://cleanair.org/wp-content/uploads/HIA-Final.pdf"">decades of progress in cleaning up our air</a> and water.</p>

<p><strong>Point: Anyone who opposes the petrochemical buildout also opposes economic growth and new jobs for the region.</strong> Rep. Mike Turzai, who represents a portion of Allegheny County and serves as the speaker of the House of Representatives, said in a statement posted online Wednesday that Peduto&rsquo;s comments represent an &ldquo;anti-growth mindset that is both irresponsible and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint: Opposing petrochemicals is not an &quot;anti-growth mindset.&quot; It is a pro-public health mindset that puts the health of an entire region ahead of profits for global companies like Shell.</strong> In one sentence, Turzai calls the mayor&rsquo;s comments irresponsible and dangerous, but then turns around and supports turning western Pennsylvania <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/plastics-appalachia-next-cancer-alley-fracking-public-health-ethane"">into the next Cancer Alley.</a> Again, there is nothing irresponsible about supporting clean air and clean water.</p>

<p><strong>Point: The region doesn&#39;t have to choose between good jobs and clean air and water.</strong> Darrin Kelly, the president of the Allegheny/Fayette Central Labor Council, issued a statement saying &ldquo;it just isn&rsquo;t true that we have to choose between good jobs and clean air and water.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint: It&rsquo;s a false narrative that the petrochemical industry provides both good jobs and clean air and water</strong>. While there are many ways to advance <a href=""https://pittsburghgreenstory.com/pennsylvania-clean-jobs-report-details-states-growing-clean-energy-sector/"">both economic development and environmental progress</a>, the petrochemical has no history of doing so. The Shell cracker plant <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/energy-environment/plastics-shell-pennsylvania-plant.html"">will emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year</a>, the equivalent of about 480,000 extra cars on our roads. It will also release <a href=""https://breatheproject.org/patrolling-our-air/"">more than 30 tons per year of hazardous air pollutants</a> like benzene, which is linked to cancer and childhood leukemia, and particulate matter linked to lung and bladder cancers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Western Pennsylvania already has <a href=""https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/states/pennsylvania/"">some of the worst air quality in the entire country.</a> If someone staunchly and unapologetically supports Shell&rsquo;s petrochemical plant, and is also hopeful for more cracker plants to come, then that person is making a tradeoff that includes sacrificing public health for jobs. It&rsquo;s that cut and dried.</p>

<p>Peduto, unlike his critics, seems not to have forgotten <a href=""https://conserveland.org/blog/article-i-section-27-of-the-pennsylvania-constitution/"">Article 1, Section 27 of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s constitution</a>:</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><em>&ldquo;The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Pennsylvanians have a right to clean air and clean water.&nbsp;The petrochemical industry doesn&rsquo;t have permission to infringe on those rights,&nbsp;unless we grant it&nbsp;that permission.</p>

PennFuture organizes tour of Philadelphia green stormwater infrastructure sites,10/30/2019,"<p>Often times, showing is better than telling. That&rsquo;s why PennFuture last month organized a bus tour in an effort to highlight the social, economic and environmental benefits of green stormwater infrastructure in Philadelphia. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to presenting an opportunity to discuss the many benefits of green stormwater infrastructure, the bus tour also allowed for a discussion about the challenges that come with aligning and integrating various city programs and initiatives.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s bus tour attracted prominent officials and business leaders from the city, including Philadelphia city Councilwoman Maria Qui&ntilde;ones-S&aacute;nchez, a staff member from her office, as well as experts and&nbsp;partners at Meliora Designs, Roofmeadow, Rodriguez Consulting LLC., and the Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Our first stop was to visit the <a href=""http://www.americanstimprovementproject.com/"" target=""_blank"">American Street Improvement Project</a> starting at Jefferson Street. American Street was once an industrial corridor, spurred by the Reading and Philadelphia Railroads that were routed through the area. The commercial strip was filled with factories, repair shops, and freight yards. Beginning in the late 1800s, this corridor produced tens of thousands of jobs for the region. But for the last several decades, the post-industrial corridor has been significantly blighted. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The two-mile long corridor is currently being reconstructed to integrate the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;Complete Streets&rdquo; vision&mdash;which ensures that city streets accommodate all users of transportation whether pedestrians, bicyclists, public transit users, or motor vehicles&mdash;with the Philadelphia Water Department&rsquo;s Green City, Clean Waters initiative that is constructing green stormwater infrastructure to manage stormwater runoff.</p>

<p>The final design incorporates 42 green stormwater infrastructure systems including rain gardens, bioswales, subsurface stormwater trenches, and tree pits. Each time it rains, GSI systems will collect more than 1.4 million gallons of stormwater runoff from the right-of-way, which will equate to more than 50 greened acres towards PWD&rsquo;s program for waterway pollutant reduction.</p>

<p>Funding for the project was made possible through partnerships with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, United States Department of Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery Discretionary Grants Program, and Philadelphia Water Department green stormwater infrastructure funds.</p>

<p>The American Street Improvement project is a unique approach to green stormwater infrastructure design and construction. The project design required extensive community outreach and engagement to ensure that the corridor was accessible to all stakeholders. Councilwoman Qui&ntilde;ones-S&aacute;nchez&rsquo;s office has been a leader in ensuring all stakeholder priorities are incorporated into the project design. During the tour she acknowledged that at the end of the day, no one stakeholder received everything they asked for.</p>

<p>Our second stop was the Shissler Recreation Center, a portion of Kensington&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.sustainable19125and19134.org/about-us/big-green-block"" target=""_blank"">Big Green Block</a>. The block was a collaboration of public, private and non-profit partners to turn a 20-acre blighted piece of vacant land strewn with trash and cinders into new green space. Councilwoman Qui&ntilde;ones-S&aacute;nchez is a strong supporter of the Shissler Recreation Center and lauded the success of the park. We were joined by Andrew Goodman from the New Kensington Community Development Corporation who shared with us the story of the Big Green Block and what it took to make the project possible. NKCDC continues to maintain the green stormwater infrastructure through the Soak it up! Adoption program.</p>

<p>The block includes the Shissler Recreation center, the Kensington High School for the Creative and Performing Arts, a spray park, Palmer Doggie Depot dog park, and Stan &ldquo;The Cutman&rdquo; Field for kids. Rain gardens, percolating astroturf, embedded planters, and a basketball court with underground stormwater runoff collection chambers are incorporated into this green space to capture 95 percent&nbsp;of the blocks&rsquo; stormwater run-off on site. The Big Green Block project began in 2008 and was made possible through partnerships with local residents, the New Kensington Community Development Corporation, the Philadelphia Water Department, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Sustainability, the Mural Arts Program, Philadelphia Parks &amp; Recreation, and the Philadelphia School District.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the return drive to our ending destination, the partners had an opportunity to discuss with Councilwoman Qui&ntilde;ones-S&aacute;nchez the challenges they are facing with incorporating green stormwater infrastructure into designs for the <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Opportunity-for-Green-Stormwater-Infrastructure-in-Philadelphias-Rebuild-Initiative"" target=""_blank"">Rebuild Initiative&rsquo;s</a> investments in the city&rsquo;s parks, recreation centers, playgrounds, and libraries. The <a href=""https://worldlandscapearchitect.com/waterloo-rebosante-philadelphia-usa-roofmeadow/#.XbnaVuhKhPZ"" target=""_blank"">Waterloo Recreation Center</a> is one of those sites receiving investments from the Rebuild Initiative, that is also slated to receive green stormwater infrastructure investments. Initially planned to be completed in late 2017, the project has run into delays in moving forward at the city level.</p>

<p>As part of PennFuture&rsquo;s work to elevate the importance of green stormwater infrastructure in Philadelphia with elected leaders and community residents, we are developing city council champions to advocate for a strong program. Philly green stormwater infrastructure bus tours are one way we are engaging with city council members around this important issue for the people of Philadelphia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture delivers Toxic Neighbor petition to U.S. Steel,10/28/2019,"<p>The steel industry has long played an important role in western Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economy, but it is impossible to ignore its equally long and harmful history of pollution. In Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 21st century innovation economy, there are no excuses for giving job-creating industries like steel a free pass for polluting our air and water. Pennsylvanians can and should have steel jobs and clean air, but it takes investment, good public policy, and corporate responsibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2017, PennFuture launched its first &ldquo;Toxic Neighbor&rdquo; campaign with a firm belief that profits shouldn&rsquo;t take priority over people&rsquo;s health and their rights to clean air and clean water, as laid out in Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The campaign was especially important because PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team had documented more than 6,700 air emission violations at U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Clairton Coke Works from January 2012 and May 2015. On average, this is more than five air quality emission violations each day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, our Toxic Neighbor campaign asked residents to send letters to Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, demanding he take action to protect our region&rsquo;s air quality. More than 300 people sent letters to Fitzgerald, increasing the public pressure on the Allegheny County Health Department to ensure that it held U.S. Steel accountable.</p>

<p>The second iteration of our Toxic Neighbor campaign began earlier this year after a fire ripped through U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Clairton Coke Works, knocking out the pollution control systems that remove sulfur dioxide from emissions for almost four months, exposing surrounding neighborhoods to harmful chemicals.</p>

<p>At the heart of the campaign was our petition to U.S. Steel, demanding the company do the following:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Retire Clairton Coke Works&rsquo; oldest, dirtiest and most problematic coke batteries - batteries 1, 2 and 3;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Modernize Clairton Coke Works by investing in technologically advanced upgrades to ensure cleaner air and Mon Valley jobs, now and in the future; and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Commit to the community and regulators that it will be more transparent about plant operations, especially in times of emergency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, PennFuture is proud to announce the petition was delivered to U.S. Steel President and Chief Executive Officer David Burritt. We made it clear in a letter to Burritt that this petition represents the collective voices of more than 5,300 people who demand clean air, healthy communities, and a commitment to public safety by U.S. Steel.</p>

<p>PennFuture started this petition to amplify voices across western Pennsylvania that were demanding cleaner air and healthier communities. Residents in Clairton and across the region are tired of pollution, accidents and lack of transparency from U.S. Steel. These are the voices of people who live and work here. They can no longer be ignored by U.S. Steel.</p>

<p>It is our hope that Burritt will take residents&rsquo; concerns seriously as he leads U.S. Steel into a new decade, and that under his leadership, U.S. Steel and its employees can prosper without harming residents&rsquo; health and the environment.</p>

<p>PennFuture wants to sincerely thank everyone who took the time to sign this petition, and for everyone who continues to advocate for clean air in the Mon Valley and Greater Pittsburgh region. If we speak loud enough, those in power will have no choice but to hear our demands.</p>

<p>Though this phase of Toxic Neighbor has ended, it will not be the end of our efforts to hold U.S. Steel and other polluters accountable. Stay tuned to see what&rsquo;s next as PennFuture continues the fight for clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment.</p>

So Pennsylvania Might Join RGGI. What Comes Next?,10/10/2019,"<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-83f5811c-7fff-ea54-19a0-1e2393e3ccc6""></span></p>

<p>On Oct. 3rd, Governor Tom Wolf signed <a href=""https://www.oa.pa.gov/Policies/eo/Documents/2019-07.pdf"">Executive Order 2019-07</a> instructing the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) &ldquo;to begin the process of developing a carbon budget and trading program that aligns with that of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).&rdquo; So what exactly does that mean?</p>

<p>It involves creating a cap-and-trade program where to emit one ton of carbon dioxide, a generator will need to hold an &ldquo;allowance.&rdquo; These allowances are created by the state and together they make the emissions cap. Generators who emit CO2 will need to buy the allowances they need at an auction, letting the market set the price. Revenue from that auction can be invested in different ways&mdash;ideally in things like more clean renewable energy and energy efficiency, but the state could fund other priorities or programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>What Kind of RGGI Program Can DEP Propose?</strong></u></p>

<p>The executive order requires the DEP proposal to be &ldquo;sufficiently consistent with the <a href=""https://www.rggi.org/sites/default/files/Uploads/Design-Archive/Model-Rule/2017-Program-Review-Update/2017_Model_Rule_revised.pdf"">RGGI Model Rule</a> such that allowances may be traded with holders of allowances from other states.&rdquo; That suggests that the affected sources will be defined the same way (i.e. electric generators with a nameplate capacity over 25 megawatts), the pool of available allowances will be sized so as not to disrupt the functioning of the market, and that the various compliance periods and accounting procedures will align. Beyond that basic structure, the DEP will have a lot of flexibility.</p>

<p>One issue where we expect debate is related to the allocation of allowances. Every source of fossil fuel generation will likely try and make the case why they are a special case deserving of free or low-cost allowances. The waste coal industry in particular has had some success making these kinds of arguments in the past, so that is a particular industry to watch. Other states also choose to hold some allowances in reserve for special purposes. For instance, Massacusets holds some allowances aside to retire when people voluntarily purchase clean energy.</p>

<p>Early projections suggest there could be $300 to $400 million per year in revenue&mdash;who gets to spend the money and what it gets spent on will be another significant issue. DEP can use money from air emissions fees to support the operation of the air program itself, and the Governor&rsquo;s remarks indicate they are at least considering other spending priorities. It&rsquo;s also clear that the Legislature will have significant input into how the money is spent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the Executive Order is an important and historic step toward reducing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s carbon pollution, it is just the beginning of a potentially long pathway that, even if all goes smoothly, could take 18 to 24 months to finalize.&nbsp; So, what comes next? The answer to that question requires some explanation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>So What Comes Next?</strong></u></p>

<p>The Regulatory Review Act (RRA) specifies a <a href=""http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/resources/docs/Regulatory_Review_Process_Manual.pdf"">detailed process</a> the DEP needs to follow to promulgate a regulation, but the actual work usually begins several months before this formal process starts, and working towards RGGI is no different.</p>

<p>Before any RGGI language is drafted, the technical and legal staff at DEP will spend a good bit of time researching issues like the ones we mentioned above and will form ideas on how they might move forward. While there are very few requirements at this early stage, DEP tends to start by developing a powerpoint presentation covering the concepts&nbsp;in the regulation, and presenting that to the various relevant advisory committees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, we expect presentations will be given, at a minimum, to the Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee, the Climate Change Advisory Committee, and the Citizens Advisory Council, but there may also be additional presentations to other committees or groups. The DEP will also likely meet with members of the regulated community, such as power plant owners, and other interested parties to discuss RGGI concepts before the drafting process begins. And, in some cases, the DEP might also hold &ldquo;listening sessions&rdquo; or other events to get even more public input.</p>

<p><u><em>The Proposal&nbsp;Stage</em></u></p>

<p>Once the DEP feels they have the necessary information and analysis, they will write a preamble to the regulation, the regulatory language itself (called &ldquo;Annex A&rdquo;), and prepare a Regulatory Analysis Form, all of which will be presented at a meeting of the Environmental Quality Board (EQB). The EQB, if they vote to do so, will formally propose to adopt the rulemaking. We expect this will take place around July.</p>

<p>Next, the DEP will prepare a package on the proposed rulemaking and have it delivered to the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) for publication in the <a href=""https://www.pabulletin.com"">Pennsylvania Bulletin</a>. At the same time the package goes to the LRB, it will also be delivered to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) and to the relevant standing committees in the House and Senate. Normally DEP regulations are sent to the House and Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committees.</p>

<p>About 10 days after the package is delivered to the LRB, it will appear in the Bulletin. This notice will mark the start of the formal public comment period (which must be at least 30 days) and it will also have information about any public hearings that are scheduled. Anyone interested in the regulation can file written comments and/or testify at a public hearing, and all of their comments will become part of the official record. The DEP will likely also schedule presentations for the relevant advisory committees and give them an opportunity to weigh in on the proposal. After the public comment period closes, IRRC will have 30 more days to submit their comments and the legislative committees may file comments at any time prior to the delivery of a final form regulation.</p>

<p>After the close of the comment period, there will appear to be a lull in the process, but a lot of work will be going on behind the scenes. DEP staff will review each and every comment they receive&nbsp;and make any changes they think are necessary to the draft rule. They will also prepare a &ldquo;Comment Response Document&rdquo; that explains how they handled every comment. Changes at this point are usually either clarifications or relatively minor fixes to the language, but occasionally big changes are necessary that will require DEP to reopen the comment period.</p>

<p><u><em>Final-form Rulemaking</em></u></p>

<p>Once DEP is ready with a final rule, it will be presented once again to the EQB and, assuming it is approved, it will once again be delivered to IRRC and the standing committees in the Legislature along with all of the comments that DEP received. This delivery needs to happen within two years of the date the rule was proposed, estimated to be July 2022. If it is not, the rulemaking ends and DEP needs to start again from the beginning.</p>

<p>Once the rule is delivered, IRRC will schedule it to be considered at their next meeting that is at least 30 days away. The public can submit comments directly to IRRC up to 48 hours before the meeting, and the standing committees can also respond at any time up to 24 hours before the meeting.</p>

<p>If IRRC approves of the rule, the Attorney General gets to review it for legality and form. If all goes well, the rule will be published as final in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If IRRC disapproves of the rule, the DEP has 40 days to deliver a report back to IRRC.&nbsp;The DEP can make changes to the rule in response to IRRCs comments, but they are not required to do so. The IRRC will consider the rule again at another meeting and the standing committees will have more time to act, but IRRC cannot stop a rule from continuing toward finalization.</p>

<p><u><strong>What Role does the Legislature Play?</strong></u></p>

<p>The legislative veto is unconstitutional in Pennsylvania so, if the standing committees want to stop a rulemaking, the House and Senate must adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving of the rule and either have that signed by the Governor or override the Governor&rsquo;s veto by a two-thirds majority. Unless that happens, the rule may be delayed, but the process will continue toward finalization.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say the Legislature doesn&rsquo;t have other methods to halt or delay the process. When Pennsylvania was drafting regulations required to fulfill the Clean Power Plan under President Obama, the legislature passed a bill that added significant delay to the above process. <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&amp;SPick=20190&amp;cosponId=30314"">Similar legislation</a> is already proposed in the state House to delay consideration of the RGGI rulemaking. There are also indications that the legislature may try and add additional rules to limit how Pennsylvania can create a RGGI-like program, including requiring that other RGGI states cannot ban the use of natural gas. We expect other new attempts to slow this process down as well.</p>

<p><u><strong>Legal Challenges</strong></u></p>

<p>Outside of the regulatory review process, there is also the possibility that any rulemaking will be challenged in the courts. Although the Governor expressed hope that this process wouldn&rsquo;t become political, the Pennsylvania House Republican caucus quickly <a href=""http://www.pahousegop.com/News/15153/Latest-News/House-Republicans-Urge-Wolf-Not-to-Go-it-Alone---Leadership-responds-to-push-to-join-RGGI-"">issued a statement</a> saying that they &ldquo;believe the executive branch cannot bind the state into multi-state agreements without the approval of the General Assembly.&rdquo; That might signal a pending legal challenge.</p>

<p>While it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising to see a lawsuit filed in fairly short order, courts tend not to weigh in until the administration makes a final action. Since any actual law is likely 18 to 24 months from going into effect, it is much more difficult&mdash;but not impossible&mdash;for potential challengers to show they will suffer harm by allowing the administrative process to continue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other more important hurdle a lawsuit would face is that our state&rsquo;s Air Pollution Control Act (APCA) gives the executive branch fairly broad powers to set emission limits and reduce pollution. Programs with interstate trading components are one of many tools the DEP has used to achieve that goal in the past. This includes the Acid Rain Program (1995), the NOx Budget Trading Program (2003), the Clean Air Interstate Rule (2005), and the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (2011). It&rsquo;s not clear how opponents will justify that regulating carbon pollution triggers an exception or is any different than previous efforts to reduce air pollution.</p>

<p>Beyond the Air Pollution Control Act, we also have the Environmental Rights Amendment in Article 1 &sect; 27 of our state Constitution, which states that, &ldquo;The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.&rdquo;&nbsp;Even if the authority in the APCA wasn&rsquo;t specific, it would be hard to justify how ignoring carbon pollution was in keeping with the Commonwealth&rsquo;s trust responsibility to conserve and maintain our natural resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Conclusion</strong></u></p>

<p>Pennsylvania has an ethical responsibility to be a leader in fighting the climate crisis. We are the fourth-highest carbon polluter in the nation and are still heavily subsidizing fossil fuels. Governor Wolf&rsquo;s executive order is a good and necessary first step to address this imbalance, but no single action is going to solve the problem.</p>

<p>In addition to implementing a cap on carbon pollution, we need to invest in cleaner alternatives to coal and gas instead of creating new subsidies for dirty fossil fuels. We need to extend and expand our Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, increase investment in energy efficiency, and enable new business models like community solar. We also need to ensure the Department of Environmental Protection has the tools it needs to do its job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Joining RGGI is a great first step, but it cannot be the only step Pennsylvania takes to address the climate crisis. Regardless, PennFuture will keep you posted as the process unfolds over the next 18 to 24 months.</p>

"Exploring Erie, and an Emerging Presence",10/7/2019,"<p>I just returned from an annual field trip we take with PennFuture&rsquo;s board of directors, as well as a terrific group of folks we call our President&rsquo;s Leadership Council. We try to visit special places in Pennsylvania&mdash;there are so many&mdash;and if these places have resonance with our mission, our program or the threats we are addressing, all the better.</p>

<p>This year we visited Erie County.</p>

<p>Erie County has been a part of my worldview from my days working to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s ecological treasures. The county&rsquo;s 77-mile Lake Erie shoreline and ribbon lake watershed contains spectacular biodiversity, natural features, great water-based recreation and rich agriculture. The rest of Erie County&mdash;by my rough estimation 80 percent&mdash;lies in the French Creek watershed, which empties into the Allegheny River and is one of the most ecologically significant tributaries to the Ohio basin, mainly because of aquatic life, freshwater mussels in particular.</p>

<p>My work now lies in defending these waters, lands and communities, and we at PennFuture see threats on the horizon.</p>

<p>One threat to the area is the lack of appreciation the rest of the state has for our northwest corner, Lake Erie and the fact that we are part of the Great Lakes ecosystem and region. The distance between Erie and Harrisburg creates another barrier&mdash;physically, psychologically and politically&mdash;and we know that dynamic can lead to this being an underserved region.</p>

<p>Our portion of Lake Erie has been relatively lucky in avoiding harmful algal blooms. These blooms have the potential to adversely impact our drinking water, and much diligence is required to maintain and improve water quality in light of changing climate and other conditions. Erie remains home to some of the most polluting industries and all have the potential to harm air, water and public health.</p>

<p>PennFuture aspires to play more of a role defending Lake Erie and the region&rsquo;s water, and we are driven to this work by legacy threats such as industrial discharges and leaking septic systems, and other emerging threats. A major concern is Erie&rsquo;s proximity to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s frack fields, its concentration of plastics manufacturing, and the massive petrochemical buildout that can occur there if the community is not attentive to this threat.</p>

<p>Related is the threat of the increasing infiltration of plastics everywhere, including into our freshwater resources, and how we can defend against a gas industry that is intent on exploiting frack gas to exponentially increase production of plastics. PennFuture aspires to shorten the distance between Erie and Harrisburg, and build capacity for the Erie community to have a stronger voice in the halls of the Capitol and be a more integrated part of our statewide water campaigns.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>So we made a field trip to Erie to increase awareness among PennFuture&rsquo;s leaders of the beauty of the area. But more important were our meetings with members of the community who are dealing with environmental threats from invasive species to pollution from Erie Coke. These community leaders, elected officials and resource managers are on the ground every day fighting for their rights to clean air and clean water.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s brand of advocacy will add value to these efforts and we look forward to close partnerships in the Erie area in the near future.</p>

A Sunnier Vision for Pennsylvania: An Alternative to Giving Tax Breaks to Fossil Fuels,9/27/2019,"<p>On Sept. 19th, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted to give yet another gift to the already <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidy-Report"">heavily subsidized natural gas</a> and petrochemical industry: a 20 percent tax break to companies that build petrochemical facilities that turn natural gas to plastics and other products. This archaic vision of economic development in Pennsylvania is a threat to our communities, ecology, and climate. Instead of giving fossil fuels even more subsidy, state policymakers could get more jobs, grid resiliency, and pollution reduction by providing a similar tax credit for utility scale solar instead.</p>

<p><strong>HB 1100: A Windfall for Polluting Petrochemical Projects</strong></p>

<p>HB 1100 is part of the so-called &ldquo;Energize PA&rdquo; package of policies aimed at giving the economic keys of the Commonwealth to the petrochemical industry. It would be more accurate to call the package <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/News/PennFuture-Policy-Memo---EnergizePA---6-7-19DRAFT.pdf"">&ldquo;Fossilize PA&rdquo;</a>, and it says a lot about what is wrong with Pennsylvania politics. Our legislators are still acting like they can ignore climate change and chase the hope of short-term economic rewards through fossil fuel subsidies, at the cost of long-term economic growth and environmental degradation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While scientists tell us we need to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, this bill gives climate-killing companies a 30-year tax break. The young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg may as well have been talking directly to them when she said at the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/video/climate/100000006732168/greta-thunberg-united-nations.html?action=click&amp;gtype=vhs&amp;version=vhs-heading&amp;module=vhs&amp;region=title-area&amp;cview=true&amp;t=53"">United Nations</a>, &ldquo;all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>HB 1100 is, essentially, an extension of the $1.6 billion tax break the legislature gave Shell to build the ethane cracker plant in Beaver County. Offered to any company that invests $1 billion to construct facilities that utilize Pennsylvania fracked gas, the Department of Revenue estimates that the credit is worth an average of <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/BI/FN/2019/0/HB1100P1593.pdf"">$26.5 million annually per facility</a> through 2050.</p>

<p>This means the taxpayer subsidy could total $795 million dollars per facility, meaning taxpayers could guarantee developers almost 80 percent of their initial investment in tax breaks&mdash;a major windfall for these projects. And, if they don&rsquo;t have enough tax liability on their own, they are allowed to sell the tax credits to someone else. Since this money doesn&rsquo;t show up as an appropriation in the budget, it&rsquo;s also much less likely that the legislature will revisit the subsidy in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a &ldquo;Solarize PA&rdquo; Tax Credit to support Utility-Scale Solar Projects</strong></p>

<p>What would happen if our Legislature took Thunberg seriously and actually tried to develop new, clean energy sources like utility scale solar?</p>

<p>We have <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=1413595&amp;DocName=PENNSYLVANIA%26%2339%3bS%20SOLAR%20FUTURE%20PLAN.PDF%20%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:blue%3b%22%3e%28NEW%29%3c/span%3e"">vast potential for developing projects</a> here in Pennsylvania, and we are seeing some growth, but our weak Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (0.5% solar by 2021) have made it far more attractive for companies to build projects in other states. That&rsquo;s why New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut all have <a href=""https://seia.org/states-map"">much more solar generation</a> than we do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Brent Alderfer, CEO of Community Energy, <a href=""https://consumer.pasenategop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2019/05/alderfer-slides.pdf"">testified before the Pennsylvania Senate </a>in May, he said that utility-scale solar was already below one dollar per watt and the prices are expected to continue to fall. Based on a calculator <a href=""https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php"">provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a>, each $1 billion investment at today&rsquo;s prices could build about a gigawatt of solar and generate more than 1.3 million MWh of clean energy per year. That is enough energy to power more than 130,000 Pennsylvania homes.</p>

<p>HB1100 could be redesigned to give the same magnitude of transferable tax credit to solar companies that it currently gives polluters, but without the negative climate and environmental impact. A $26.5 million dollar transferable tax credit per billion dollars of private investment in utility scale solar would equate to almost $20 per megawatt-hour. That would, in effect, be similar to raising the Solar Alternative Energy Credit (also called SREC) price around $20 without directly impacting consumers&rsquo; electric bills. This would encourage a boom of new private investment dollars into the state and significant growth in solar jobs.</p>

<p>The impact on Pennsylvania&rsquo;s climate goals would also be significant. If that new clean energy generation replaces natural gas generation, we would save over half a million tons of carbon pollution per year. Assuming a social cost of carbon of <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5321009/"">$31.2 per ton of CO2 emissions</a>, the carbon reductions alone would have an annual value of more than $31 million dollars&mdash;more than the direct cost of the tax break itself.</p>

<p>A transferable tax credit for utility scale solar would also produce more homegrown jobs. Penn State University <a href=""https://www.lightsourcebp.com/us/penn-state-solar-project/"">recently signed a contract</a>&nbsp;with Lightsource BP to build a 70MW facility. That is, to date, the largest single project in Pennsylvania and it is designed to generate half of Penn State&rsquo;s annual energy demand. That project is projected to result in an additional 250 local jobs. Using that same job-creation rate, a gigawatt of solar projects would create over 3,500 jobs&mdash;three and a half times what HB1100 requires to qualify for the subsidy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, building more solar generation would provide much needed diversity in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s energy grid. Right now most of our generation comes from a mix of nuclear, gas, and coal, but the nuclear and coal plants are rapidly approaching retirement. If we continue to subsidize the gas industry, we will get what we pay for and gas will dominate our electric grid. Having all of our eggs in that basket is a recipe for volatile prices and even blackouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Choice Between Two Futures</strong></p>

<p>What has been stunning about HB 1100 is how little the legislature has debated its efficacy, given how significant a decision it is. Pennsylvania is at a fork in the road&mdash;we can invest in the industries, like solar, that are rapidly growing, future proof, and protective of our environment or we can invest in the industries of yesteryear, with an uncertain future, and harsh polluting realities. There is a better vision for Pennsylvania&mdash;let&rsquo;s turn the 20 percent tax break for polluters into an investment in an industry of the future like utility scale solar. Let&rsquo;s&nbsp; &ldquo;Solarize&rdquo; Pennsylvania instead of &ldquo;Fossilizing&rdquo; it.</p>

Fracking Across Property Lines: Briggs v. Southwestern Energy Production Company,9/13/2019,"<p>Multiyear litigation over unconventional oil and gas development&mdash;specifically, hydraulic fracturing or &ldquo;fracking&rdquo;&mdash;has caused a stir in Pennsylvania courts regarding the interpretation of a long-standing property law rule.</p>

<p>Established in the late 1800s, the &ldquo;rule of capture&rdquo; considers subsurface oil and gas owned only when it is &ldquo;captured&rdquo; or produced from a well. The rule was originally born out of necessity due to the fugitive nature of oil and gas and the complex relationship between neighboring landowners regarding the ownership of shared subsurface oil and gas deposits.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the rule of capture protected the right of property owners to use their land for oil and gas exploration. However, fracking companies have abused the rule, essentially assuming it allowed them to drill a well on its leased property, tap subsurface oil and gas from adjoining properties, and be absolved from legal liability. This legal exploit is exactly how Texas-based Southwestern Energy Company (SWN) extracted natural gas from the Briggs family property in northeast Pennsylvania, and the family argues that this practice constitutes an illegal trespass onto their property.</p>

<p>Stemming from the family&#39;s 2015 complaint, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania must now decide whether the rule of capture extends to fracking. In 2017, the trial court extended the meaning of the rule to encompass fracking practices. The trial court&rsquo;s decision effectively halted the Briggses&rsquo; trespass action. On appeal in 2018, the Superior Court reversed the lower court&rsquo;s decision, stating that SWN could be held liable for damages in trespass. The Superior Court refused to recognize the rule of capture as a defense to trespass related to fracking because of the intrusive nature of fracking. SWN appealed the Superior Court&rsquo;s decision, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania granted its petition on November 20, 2018.</p>

<p>On Sept. 12, lawyers from both sides argued the following issue in front of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does the rule of capture apply to oil and gas produced from wells that were completed using hydraulic fracturing and preclude trespass liability for allegedly draining oil or gas from under nearby property, where the well is drilled solely on and beneath the driller&rsquo;s own property and the hydraulic fracturing fluids are injected solely on or beneath the driller&rsquo;s own property?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attorney Robert L. Byer pleaded SWN&rsquo;s case first in front of the Court, and his argument relied heavily on long standing precedent recognizing the rule of capture as precluding trespass liability. When questioned why the injection of fracking proppants (the solid material used to keep fractures open) on to a neighbor&rsquo;s property should not be considered a trespass, Byer deferred to the uncertainty involved in the fracking process.</p>

<p>He stated that the technology does not exist to sufficiently prove that SWN&rsquo;s proppants crossed the property line, entering the Briggs&#39; land. Furthermore, when asked to distinguish this practice from slant drilling, which the rule of capture does not absolve trespass liability, Byer stated that slant drilling violates the rule of capture because the driller physically and consciously crossed on to the neighbor&rsquo;s property. Byer concluded that the state Legislature is more fit to solve this issue rather than a &ldquo;retroactive&rdquo; judicial decision.<span baskerville="""" bell="""" class=""qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"" font-size:="""" id=""E330"" is=""qowt-word-run"" new="""" old="""" qowt-eid=""E330"" serif="""" style=""display: inline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: "" times=""""></span></p>

<p>Conversely, Laurence M. Kelly, the Briggs&#39; attorney, advocated that the rule of capture does not preclude trespass related to fracking activities. Kelly compared the invasive nature of injecting proppants into a neighboring subsurface to the drill bit used in illegal slant drilling practices. He asserted that SWN consciously and physically injected proppants into the Briggs&rsquo; subsurface property, continuously leaching fuel from their land without consent.</p>

<p>We think this is an important case to watch because if the Court decides in SWN&rsquo;s favor, there could be negative implications for Pennsylvania landowners with subsurface gas and oil at their property&rsquo;s boundary. Oil companies like SWN could shop around, establish a lease with one landowner at the cheapest price, tap the communal oil, and owe no royalties to the neighbor. Contrary to SWN&rsquo;s argument, this will create negative economic impacts as neighboring landowners could be forced into a race to the bottom to establish a lease in order to capitalize on oil beneath their land.</p>

<p>Furthermore, such an interpretation of the rule will necessarily strip the non-leasing landowner of any legal recourse. As the fracking boom continues in many areas of Pennsylvania, the Court&rsquo;s upcoming decision may help to clarify the interplay between the rule of capture and fracking across property lines.<span baskerville="""" bell="""" class=""qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"" font-size:="""" is=""qowt-word-run"" new="""" old="""" qowt-eid=""E330"" serif="""" style=""display: inline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: "" times=""""></span></p>

Philadelphia Energy Solutions' Failures,9/10/2019,"<p>In late August, I traveled to South Philadelphia to testify before Philadelphia&#39;s <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/programs/refinery-advisory-group/"">Refinery Advisory Group</a>, which was formed by Mayor Jim Kenney to consider how the closure of the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery will affect the city&rsquo;s economy, environment, public health and safety.</p>

<p>My message was simple: dumping money into the petrochemical industry is a dead end for Pennsylvania and we need a better and more sustainable pathway for our future.</p>

<p>Originally owned and operated by Sunoco, the refinery by 2012 was in financial trouble and needed more capital to continue operations. The Carlyle Group put up $175 million and ended up with a two-thirds share of the new company&mdash;PES&mdash;as well as operational control of the 1,300 acre facility. Sunoco, in a separate deal, merged with Energy Transfer Partners around the same time and that company retained the remaining one-third stake. In spite of this deal, and with another $25 million in grants from Pennsylvania taxpayers along with tax benefits and concessions from environmental regulators, PES remained financially troubled.</p>

<p>Phil Rinaldi, the former chief executive officer of PES, often blames the company&rsquo;s financial difficulties on environmental regulations and, particularly, the ethanol mandate that requires refiners to blend in a certain amount of ethanol or purchase credits, known as RINs. Despite the fact that other refineries are able to meet the standard, PES hasn&rsquo;t actually been buying all the RINs it needs for the past few years and they now owe the Environmental Protection Agency more than $350 million worth of credits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apparently it&rsquo;s easier to blame the EPA than admit their failure is largely self-inflicted. In 2013, for example, when crude oil prices were more than $90 a barrel, Rinaldi blew through $186 million on a terminal to transport crude by rail, otherwise known as the <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/stories/protecting-your-community-crude-oil-bomb-trains"">oil bomb trains</a>. When oil prices collapsed in 2015, that plan quickly became unprofitable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In spite of the failures, Carlyle and the other owners made sure to secure tidy profits for themselves, <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/energy/philadelphia-energy-solutions-files-bankruptcy-plan-20180122.html"">taking more than $400 million in dividends</a> from PES, more than half of which was financed through <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-pes-bankruptcy-insight/refiner-goes-belly-up-after-big-payouts-to-carlyle-group-idUSKCN1G40I1"">debt against the refinery.</a> As a result, even after emerging from bankruptcy reorganization in August 2018, it seemed likely that PES was again <a href=""https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/paper/beyond-bankruptcy"">heading for bankruptcy</a>. When a massive explosion shook the refinery on June 21, that became a reality sooner than expected as PES decided to cease operations and once-again <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pes-bankruptcy/philadelphia-energy-solutions-files-for-bankruptcy-after-refinery-fire-idUSKCN1UH0O9"">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a>.</p>

<p>PES is now attempting to restructure its debt and reorganize, and Phil Rinaldi is back in the picture once again attempting to get another bailout for the facility. Aside from restarting the facility, this time he also proposes to build a digester to create methane gas from the city&rsquo;s food waste, but that greenwashing is not only too little and too late to cover up the failures of the past, it doesn&rsquo;t begin to offset the continued pollution from the plant. The petrochemical industry isn&rsquo;t the economic savior it&rsquo;s made out to be, but that is apparently a hard lesson to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We Must Act on Climate</strong></p>

<p>Last October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/"">a special report</a> finding that to have a reasonable chance at keeping global warming below 1.5 &deg;C we will need to reduce emissions by 45 percent from 2010 to 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

<p>That recommendation is significantly more aggressive than the one put forth under the Paris Agreement, which calls for a 26 to 28 percent reduction in emissions from 2005 to 2030. It is also bolder than the path put forth by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, who proposed meeting the Paris Agreement goal and then reaching an 80 percent reduction by 2050.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Philadelphia has responded with its <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/documents/powering-our-future-a-clean-energy-vision-for-philadelphia/"">Clean Energy Vision</a> and is attempting to shift electricity consumption to 100 percent renewable generation by 2050. City leaders are also taking other positive steps such as planning to convert the city&rsquo;s street lights to more efficient LEDs. But, pollution from our electric grid is just one piece of a larger problem. We need to come to terms with our overreliance on dirty fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The gas industry often claims that carbon pollution has declined as natural gas generation has replaced coal on our power grid, but these claims overlook the fact that those reductions are not sustainable. As recently as 2004, Pennsylvania had 90 percent of its generation coming from either nuclear or coal and 5 percent coming from gas. By 2017, Pennsylvania had 34 percent of our generation coming from gas. With 27 percent of our nuclear capacity scheduled to go offline in the next two years, coupled with sharply declining coal generation, gas could easily become 70 percent or more of our generation. That scenario would be a climate killer, and it doesn&rsquo;t even consider the gas used outside of generation in facilities like the Philadelphia Energy Solutions facility.</p>

<p><strong>Attempting to Restart Operations is a Dangerous and Unsustainable Pathway</strong></p>

<p>When we dump money into the petrochemical industry we are buying additional problems that will need to be fixed&mdash;possibly at great expense to taxpayers&mdash;in a few short years. Often, as in the case of PES, this goes beyond carbon pollution. The refinery was the <a href=""https://iaspub.epa.gov/triexplorer/tri_release.facility"">largest source of toxic air emissions</a> in southeast Pennsylvania and has also been a significant emitter of ozone-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) as well as particulate emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As is common with petrochemical plants, even with the facility closed the environmental problems don&rsquo;t go away. There are 1,300 acres of heavily contaminated soil and groundwater that must be remediated, but also ongoing air pollution. PES will likely be able to register the reductions in VOC, NOx, PM-10, and PM-2.5 emissions from its closure as Emission Reduction Credits (ERCs) with the Pennsylvania DEP. These credits have a 10-year shelf life and can then be purchased by other entities who want to increase emissions. Delaying closure of this plant could mean more pollution for years.</p>

<p>Moreover, the remediation of PES should not be delayed. The site is already at a heightened risk for flooding during severe weather events and, at the rates of sea-level rise predicted by the IPCC, areas of the site could be underwater before 2050 and most of the site could be flooded before 2100. The more we wait, the more we risk of additional catastrophic events that will result in much higher remediation costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We Need To Focus on Building Sustainable Industries and Jobs</strong></p>

<p>If we are going to reach our climate goals, and if we are going to address the chronic air pollution impacting the residents of the region, the city needs to transition away from fossil fuels to more sustainable industries. In the near term, we need skilled workers to assist with the closure and remediation of the site, but we also need a long term plan. We see this vividly in the coal and nuclear industries where plants are reaching the end of their useful life and no new plants are being built to replace them. Those jobs are going away and, for the most part, there has been little thought given to the transition of the workforce.</p>

<p>While relatively low fuel prices and considerable subsidies makes gas and other petrochemicals inexpensive, the industry suffers from the same fundamental problem. Fossil fuel prices have always been volatile and prices are likely to rise. Clean renewable alternatives, on the other hand,&nbsp; are already cost-competitive in many areas and prices continue to fall. Subsidizing fundamentally unsustainable industries like petrochemicals isn&rsquo;t the path to long-term job growth, it actually creates more at-risk workers.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that when the Bureau of Labor Statistics projected the <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/home.htm"">top 20 fastest growing job sectors from 2016 to 2026</a>, solar installers and wind turbine service technicians topped the list with 105 percent and 96 percent growth respectively while no petrochemical jobs made that list. We see similar results in Pennsylvania where a recent report from the National Association of State Energy Officials showed that solar alone already accounts for well over 4,000 jobs in Pennsylvania with much less than one percent of our generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the future is in green jobs, a number of fossil fuel jobs will continue to be necessary, particularly for the safe closure and remediation of retiring facilities. Unfortunately PES recently announced layoffs of almost almost 400 union workers, including maintenance workers and operators. This raises significant concerns that there will be a lack of qualified staff to safely wind down operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A Pathway Forward</strong></p>

<p>Recently, more than 300 stakeholders came together with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on a project called &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PASolarFuture/plan"">Finding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future</a>&rdquo; to identify 15 key strategies and 52 separate action items that could significantly enhance clean renewable energy deployment in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>One key ask of the stakeholders was to support the creation and adoption of uniform policies to streamline siting and land-use issues while encouraging conservation.&nbsp; In certain cases, co-locating solar resources with agricultural operations may be beneficial, but often we are seeking to preserve prime agricultural and forest land and encourage solar on less valuable property, including former industrial sites. We&rsquo;ve seen this used across the border in New Jersey where PSE&amp;G reported that landfill and brownfield solar sites were about 40 percent less expensive than typical residential installations.</p>

<p>While direct policy intervention to encourage renewable development on brownfields is a possibility, programs could also indirectly encourage development on brownfields by easing access to capital. Some programs, like expanding our Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards or Enabling community solar in Pennsylvania, will take state action, but Philadelphia could take action on its own in a number of different forms such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Expanding the availability of solar lending products through a green bank.</li>
	<li>Lowering interest rates through loan loss reserves.</li>
	<li>Easing third-party financing decisions by entering into long-term contracts for solar energy from new facilities on brownfields.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few of the action items identified, but even if it is not an exhaustive list, the stakeholder project has clearly shown that there is considerable interest in these policies and a significant amount of expertise in the region ready to assist in their further development. With the closure of PES, the city has an opportunity to leverage this work to rapidly expand its sustainable development. We encourage the city to do so.</p>

In the Headlights - 2020,8/30/2019,"<p>I do pretty well living in the moment and staying focused on tasks at hand, but I enjoy being strategic, and that means having a forward-looking orientation. This is a time of year when everyone talks about the swift passage of time as our short summers begin to transition to autumn. I fully appreciate the imminent arrival of the holiday season and, with it, the turning of our calendars to 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Between now and then, our state legislators will reconvene for a final six-week push before this legislative session ends. This will be another chance for our state&rsquo;s elected officials to do the business of the people&nbsp;and to do what is needed for our environment and climate.</p>

<p>With the arrival of a new season comes new priorities. PennFuture will be working to shape important proposals to preserve our nuclear fleet as a hedge against climate pollution, and there has been talk about fees on carbon pollution that we are keenly interested in. Will our legislature find a path forward to help pay for the myriad of voluntary measures encompassed in the Phase 3 Watershed Implementation Plan for the Chesapeake Bay, which can result in dramatic improvements in our local streams and rivers?&nbsp; This can only happen if our legislators grasp the dire need for dedicated funding for clean water and find a revenue source for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We typically see a flurry of legislation at the end of the session. The need for action in Harrisburg this fall and this session feels particularly important. I&rsquo;m concerned that once we cross into 2020, all attention will turn to the national election. Activists, advocates, politicians, donors, voters&nbsp; &ndash; appropriately &ndash; will be laser focused on the outcomes in early primary states, the nominating conventions, campaigns and the election for the next president.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When PennFuture formed its strategic alliance with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, it created capacity for PennFuture to launch a civic engagement program. This program is marked by our on-the-ground community organizing; growing our ACE (Advocates for Conservation and Education) teams that&nbsp;play a role in educating their elected officials on important issues; and elevating non-partisan campaign conversations about environmental issues among all candidates for public office. You might recall hearing about our Common Agenda for Conservation during the last gubernatorial campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a 501 (c) (3) organization, PennFuture is strictly prohibited from engaging in political activity, endorsements and elections. However, the IRS does grant latitude in the role we can play in reaching a segment of the population known as the New American Majority, also referred to as the Rising American Electorate. This segment is defined by individuals of color, single women and millennials. The IRS allows us to do non-partisan voter registration in places where these demographics are prevalent, but where there are substantial gaps in their voting registrations.&nbsp;PennFuture hopes to begin voter registration work in early 2020. We also hope to do &ldquo;Get Out the Vote&rdquo; work closer to the 2020 general election.</p>

<p>Many of the national environmental groups are focusing on Pennsylvania in 2020, and it&rsquo;s no surprise that others of all stripes will be politically engaged here.</p>

<p>The other momentous event upcoming in 2020 is the 50th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22. Commemorations of Earth Day 1970 cannot be nostalgic events. We must show up, speak up and unequivocally and unapologetically acknowledge the vicious attacks on our environment, communities and public health that have taken place in recent years, and use this Earth Day to create change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Earth Day, we must make welcome all and elevate the energy of our climate youth, their families and the front line communities confronted still with the realities of pollution and a dystopian climate future if we do not act and create change in 2020. PennFuture hopes to provide many opportunities for you to join us for Earth Day 2020 action in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regardless, work remains to close out 2019, and we&rsquo;ll be sure to keep fighting for our shared environment in Harrisburg and all across Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

Tohickon Creek Is Saved...For Now,8/28/2019,"<p>The lower Tohickon Creek, located immediately downstream of the dam at Lake Nockamixon, was designated&nbsp;as part of the Lower Delaware National Wild and Scenic River in 2000. Located in Bucks County, the Tohickon flows through protected lands like&nbsp;Ralph Stover State Park and provides some of the best recreational opportunities in the area, especially for seasonal whitewater enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Almost 25 years ago, the Tinicum Conservancy petitioned to have the lower Tohickon Creek redesignated to an &ldquo;Exceptional Value&rdquo;&nbsp;stream to recognize and protect its outstanding water quality. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection is the agency tasked with reviewing the petition. Unfortunately, DEP&rsquo;s initial recommendation was to downgrade the lower Tohickon&rsquo;s designated use in 1997. In response and since that time, Tinicum Conservancy, Delaware Riverkeeper Network&nbsp;and others have repeatedly given DEP numerous data, reports, and information supporting the petition for EV designation. Despite these efforts, earlier this year, DEP issued&nbsp;<a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/Drinking Water and Facility Regulation/WaterQualityPortalFiles/Stream_Packages/Tunkhannock_Creek/Tohickon Creek Draft Report.pdf"">another draft redesignation recommendation</a> which again proposed to downgrade the protections for the creek.</p>

<p>A quick primer on stream designations: In Pennsylvania,&nbsp;surface water is given a &ldquo;designated use&rdquo; which is established based on the ecological and human health uses of a particular waterbody. A designated use is the water quality goal set by the state, whether or not that use is actually being attained. In the case of the lower Tohickon, it is currently designated as a &ldquo;Cold Water Fishes&rdquo; waterbody.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.pacode.com/secure/data/025/chapter93/chap93toc.html"">Water Quality Standards require</a> that the designated uses of each waterbody be protected. Any person can petition the state to change the designated use of a waterbody, based on biological, chemical, or physical characteristics of the water. The 1995 redesignation petition sought for the lower Tohickon&rsquo;s designated use to be changed to Exceptional Value, the most protective of the designated uses. The DEP, however, proposed to change the lower Tohickon to &ldquo;Trout Stocking Fishery,&rdquo; which requires less stringent protections than a &ldquo;Cold Water Fishes&rdquo; designation. For more on the redesignation process, please view&nbsp;<a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/News/PennFutureStreamHndbk09.pdf"">PennFuture&rsquo;s Stream Redesignation Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>PennFuture &ndash; along with over 60 of our members and supporters &ndash; stood up for the lower Tohickon and told DEP not to downgrade or remove critical protections for the creek. As PennFuture <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-strongly-opposes-any-attempts-to-downgrade-status-of-the-Tohickon-Creek"">pointed out in our letter</a>, a downgrade of the lower Tohickon is not supported by the data and is an inappropriate action for the DEP to take.</p>

<p>The good news: In response to this public outcry, DEP stated that it has agreed to undertake further analysis of the Lake Nockamixon Dam to see how operational or infrastructural changes could affect its analysis.</p>

<p>We are very pleased that DEP has pulled back from its faulty analysis and has stated its commitment to a thorough analysis of the lower Tohickon Creek. But&nbsp;if history is any indication, we know that the battle over the lower Tohickon may not be over yet. PennFuture will continue to monitor DEP&rsquo;s analysis and ensure the appropriate protections are in place for Tohickon Creek.</p>

<p>We have to be vigilant to protect the lower Tohickon Creek &ndash; and all the waters of the Commonwealth &ndash; not only from pollution, but from regulatory rollbacks that threaten to remove protections and degrade our waters.</p>

Pennsylvania still not doing its part to restore the Chesapeake Bay,8/26/2019,"<p>When the Environmental Protection Agency developed a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the Chesapeake Bay in 2010, it marked a historic cleanup effort to restore one of our nation&rsquo;s most precious treasures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bay TMDL identifies the total amount of certain pollutants (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment) that the entire Chesapeake Bay Watershed &mdash; including portions of Pennsylvania &mdash; can contribute, but still be able to restore water quality in the Bay to a level that will support protected water uses, like swimming and fishing. To ensure pollutant reductions are achieved, the Bay TMDL establishes deadlines for the states to develop and implement plans within the watershed to reduce these pollutants.</p>

<p>Each State&rsquo;s proposal to accomplish these reductions must be articulated in their respective plans, called Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs), in order to provide &ldquo;reasonable assurance&rdquo; that the required reductions in pollution will be achieved, EPA is responsible for evaluating whether the plans are sufficient.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s contributions to the Chesapeake Bay cleanup is incredibly important. Approximately half of the land area of Pennsylvania drains to the Chesapeake Bay, and Pennsylvania comprises 35 percent of the entire Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The Susquehanna River is by far the largest tributary to the Bay, providing 90 percent of the freshwater flow to the upper Bay and half of the total freshwater that enters the Bay. Without Pennsylvania getting its act together, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed has little hope of being restored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since even before the Bay TMDL&rsquo;s implementation, PennFuture has worked to support efforts to reduce pollution to the Susquehanna River. When agricultural interests initially challenged the Bay TMDL in federal court, PennFuture intervened to support EPA. We have lobbied in Harrisburg for funding for pollution reduction programs and pressed for robust water quality protections in permits and agency programs.</p>

<p>PennFuture serves as the Pennsylvania state lead for the Choose Clean Water Coalition, which harnesses the collective power of more than 230 groups to advocate for clean rivers and streams in the Chesapeake Bay region. Most recently our President &amp; CEO, Jacqui Bonomo, served on the Forestry Workgroup of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s third WIP Steering Committee, which provided feedback and input on industry best management practices.</p>

<p>However, even with all of these efforts, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waters and the Chesapeake Bay remain polluted. Over the years of implementing the Bay TMDL, Pennsylvania has consistently fallen short. During EPA&rsquo;s midpoint assessment, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s agriculture and urban/suburban sectors were at the &ldquo;backstop action level,&rdquo; meaning that EPA identified substantial concerns with the strategy to implement the TMDL goals and had taken necessary federal actions to get Pennsylvania back on track. Unfortunately, these efforts seem to have been to little avail as Pennsylvania&rsquo;s third WIP remains woefully insufficient.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s third WIP provides little assurance that the state will achieve the required pollution reduction goals. It doesn&rsquo;t even set forth a plan that, if fully implemented, would achieve the goals. There is little accountability built into the plan, and Pennsylvania faces a huge gap in necessary funding to be able to even implement this deficient plan, let alone the measures necessary to actually reduce pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Pennsylvania submits its deficient WIP3 to EPA for its review and approval, it faces threats of liability. Since the Plan clearly does not provide the necessary &ldquo;reasonable assurances&rdquo; that reduction targets will be approved, EPA can not legitimately approve the plan. Other states are also displeased with Pennsylvania&rsquo;s lack of progress. Maryland&rsquo;s Governor Larry Hogan <a href=""https://governor.maryland.gov/2019/05/29/governor-hogan-voices-concerns-over-pennsylvania-clean-water-progress/"">even sent a letter to Governor Wolf</a> expressing his deep concern that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Plan falls short of its critical commitment. And a recent editorial suggested that a lawsuit could be the way to put Pennsylvania back on track. Each of these threats would cost Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania legislature should fund programs that reduce pollution to our rivers and streams to ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t incur even more expenses by failing to do what is necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/20190607-PF-WIP3-comments.pdf"">recently submitted public comments</a> on Pennsylvania&rsquo;s draft WIP3 commending the Department of Environmental Protection on the stakeholder engagement deployed in the development of the WIP, but critiquing the Plan&rsquo;s significant shortfalls such as its failure to design to meet the minimum necessary reductions of nitrogen, articulate an accountability structure, or ensure the funding necessary to meet even its marginal reductions.&nbsp;For these reasons, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s WIP3 does not provide the necessary &ldquo;reasonable assurance&rdquo; that the required reductions in pollution will be achieved. Even with the modifications the Department has made since the public comment period ended, we do not believe Pennsylvania&rsquo;s WIP3 satisfies the required standard to be approved by the EPA.</p>

<p>However, as Pennsylvania continues to lag behind the other states, it is important that some progress begins to be made. In light of this, we hope a path can be created that directs Pennsylvania to immediately implement critical elements in its WIP3 while the Department works on addressing the significant deficiencies and shortfalls in its Plan.</p>

<p>We will continue to work with Pennsylvania state agencies to implement pollution reduction measures, advocate to the legislature to support funding to implement important practices, and monitor those that contribute pollution for compliance with the law and opportunities to go further.</p>

Running for a Reason,8/21/2019,"<p>How far are you willing to go to prove a point?&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Sam Bencheghib, it&rsquo;s about 3,100 miles, or roughly the distance between New York and Los Angeles. All on foot, in the span of 160 days, running on shoes made from recycled plastics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That last part is important, because it underscores the purpose of every step of his journey. Sam Bencheghib is running across America to raise awareness about the massive amounts of plastic currently polluting our oceans and waterways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sam, who recently met with PennFuture employees in Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, doesn&rsquo;t mince words when explaining the importance of his run. By 2050, there will be more plastic in our oceans than fish. There are already more microplastics in our oceans and on our beaches than stars in our galaxy, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problems posed by plastic pollution are massive, yet the issue isn&rsquo;t being addressed on a global scale by governments and corporations. That doesn&rsquo;t deter Sam from his journey, though. In fact, it only makes him more motivated to raise awareness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you have to do something crazy to get people&#39;s&nbsp;attention,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His journey started on July 26 in New York City, and it didn&rsquo;t take long to pass over into New Jersey and Pennsylvania. From there, his path will take him through West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and California. He hopes to arrive near Los Angeles on Dec. 20.</p>

<p>To put it into perspective, Sam will be running the equivalent of about 115 marathons in a span of about 160 days, with a goal of running between 20 to 30 miles per day. He will stop to rest only on the weekends and usually only in bigger cities, where he intends on meeting with and speaking to college students, environmental organizations and local politicians about the need to address the plastics pollution epidemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what he did in Pennsylvania, meeting with local politicians and community activists. Sam said his goal is to get people on board with his message, but it&rsquo;s been a challenge in Pennsylvania because of a <a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/news/2019/06/pa-blocks-plastic-bag-bans-for-at-least-a-year.html"">recently passed moratorium</a> on plastic bag bans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That so-called &ldquo;ban on bans&rdquo; was enacted as part of budget discussions in Harrisburg in June, and bars local municipalities and cities from banning plastic bags for at least a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Pennsylvania, it&rsquo;s been a lot harder than I thought it would be,&rdquo; Sam said about creating awareness and momentum for his movement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The difficulties found within Pennsylvania won&rsquo;t derail his message, Sam said. After all, fighting against plastic pollution has been a passion of his since he was a young boy on the Indonesian island of Bali.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During his childhood, Sam and his older brother would clean up beaches in Bali, completely removing any traces of plastic. It wouldn&rsquo;t even take 24 hours before the beaches would be full of plastic again, a product of local streams and rivers carrying the pollution into the ocean and onto the beaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt we were making a difference but, realistically, were we really making a difference?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when we decided to focus on rivers and streams and educating local government and businesses.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>From that experience came a new organization founded by Sam and his brother called &ldquo;<a href=""https://makeachange.world/"">Make a Change World</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam, who is 22 years old, brought his message and ambition to America when he enrolled at Lehigh University in eastern Pennsylvania. Recently graduated, Sam knew there would be no better time to spread a message that desperately needs to be heard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the cross-country run, he will be accompanied by friend Josh Madre, who follows behind Sam in an RV and documents the journey with a video camera. The entire journey can be tracked on the organization&rsquo;s website at <a href=""https://makeachange.world/"">https://makeachange.world</a>.</p>

<p>For his part, Sam understands the daunting task ahead of him, both in running across the vast expanse of America, and in trying to combat a problem in plastics pollution that is already at a crisis level. But he isn&rsquo;t deterred, either in body or spirit, because he knows he will bring about change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing this if I didn&rsquo;t think it would make a difference,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every step I take across this country is one step closer to a world without plastic pollution.&quot;</p>

"Before You Leap, Learn About Your Water Quality",8/19/2019,"<p>During the dog days of summer, a bend in a river might provide the perfect reprieve from the heat.</p>

<p>But with recent articles about <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/us/blue-green-algae-dogs.html"">dangerous algal blooms</a>&nbsp;and the complicated answer to the <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/delaware-schuylkill-river-swim-philadelphia-pollution-20190815.html"">safety of swimming in the Delaware or Schuylkill rivers</a> near Philadelphia, it is important to know about the quality of the water you&#39;re about to dive&nbsp;into.

The Problem with Pipelines,8/5/2019,"<p>The burgeoning petrochemical movement is in its infancy in western Pennsylvania, but we&rsquo;ve already experienced significant detriments to both the environment and private property because of fracking and pipeline accidents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take a look at the recent track record of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners. Maybe you&rsquo;ve never heard of the company, but you&rsquo;ve almost certainly heard about its pipeline projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Dakota Access Pipeline, which was so controversial that <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/dakota-pipeline-protests/north-dakota-governor-orders-pipeline-protesters-leave-citing-winter-weather-n689366"">thousands of people staged a sit-in protest</a> over environmental concerns. The Mariner East 2 pipeline &mdash; constructed by Sunoco, which is a subsidiary of Energy Transfer &mdash; which was beset by so many spills, sinkholes, and shutdowns that Attorney General Josh Shapiro <a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/news/2019/03/pa-attorney-general-launches-investigation-into-mariner-east-ii-pipeline.html"">opened a criminal investigation</a> into the project. The Revolution Pipeline in western Pennsylvania, which exploded last September, <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/09/10/natural-gas-pipeline-blast-in-beaver-county-prompts-evacuation/"">destroying one house and damaging another</a> while literally shaking an entire community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those are just the glaring examples of incompetence. There are others, like the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) assessing a $355,000 penalty against Energy Transfer Partners for <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/05/03/dep-hits-sunoco-with-another-fine-for-mariner-east-2-pipeline-construction/"">polluting streams and wetlands</a> across nine Pennsylvania counties. Or another fine from the DEP &mdash; <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/news/20180827/texas-company-fined-for-damages-to-raccoon-creek-during-pipeline-construction"">to the tune of $150,000</a> &mdash; after polluting a portion of Raccoon Creek in Beaver County last summer.</p>

<p>All told, Energy Transfer <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/ProgramIntegration/Pennsylvania-Pipeline-Portal/Pages/Mariner-East-II.aspx#Compliance"">has been hit with nearly 100 violations</a> &mdash; the most recent coming on July 26 &mdash;&nbsp;from the Mariner East project alone, and fines that surpass $13 million.</p>

<p>The list goes on. The situation became so untenable in Pennsylvania that the DEP <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/02/08/DEP-halts-permit-review-gas-pipeline-Energy-Transfer-Sunoco-Revolution-Mariner-East-Pennsylvania/stories/201902080125"">suspended all permit reviews</a> for all of Energy Transfer Partners&rsquo; ongoing projects. This, only after the company <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/05/14/DEP-Energy-Transfer-fix-damage-streams-wetlands-revolution-pipeline-Beaver-permit/stories/201905140158"">failed to abide by a DEP order</a> to resolve issues at the Beaver County explosion site.</p>

<p>As if a criminal investigation from one state agency and permit suspensions from another weren&rsquo;t enough, Gov. Tom Wolf <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-issues-statement-dep-pipeline-permit-bar/"">entered the fray</a> with a damning statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been a failure by Energy Transfer and its subsidiaries to respect our laws and our communities,&rdquo; Wolf said in a news release. &ldquo;This is not how we strive to do business in Pennsylvania, and it will not be tolerated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a step in the right direction that Gov. Wolf acknowledged the repeated failures of the pipeline industry in Pennsylvania, but is it enough? Evidence suggests otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even after the debacles of the Mariner East and Revolution pipelines, the DEP in December <a href=""https://archive.triblive.com/news/state-dep-action-clears-way-for-construction-of-shell-falcon-ethane-pipeline-in-3-counties/"">approved&nbsp;construction of an ethane pipeline</a> that will feed up to 107,000 barrels per day to Royal Dutch Shell&rsquo;s cracker plant in Beaver County.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on past experiences, can you guess what&rsquo;s already happened? During construction, Shell&rsquo;s pipeline <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/ProgramIntegration/Pennsylvania-Pipeline-Portal/Pages/Shell.aspx"">incurred four violations from the DEP</a> between April and July alone. The most recent violation on July 22&nbsp;involved the spilling of 500 gallons of drilling fluid, 30 gallons of which impacted&nbsp;Raccoon Creek, the same waterway previously impacted by Energy Transfer Partners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want this to be your future, action is required. The fracked gas, pipeline, and plastics manufacturing companies have millions of dollars to throw at public relations, and too often put profits over people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Energy Transfer Partners polluted and destroyed Pennsylvania, they experienced <a href=""https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-reports-fourth-quarter-2018-results-record"">&ldquo;record performance and continued growth&rdquo;</a> in the fourth quarter of 2018. The company hasn&rsquo;t missed a beat and isn&rsquo;t slowed down in the slightest. The pollution it created in Pennsylvania and fines it was assessed are simply a part of&nbsp;doing business. It&rsquo;s a machine that will churn on as long as we let it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last month, Energy Transfer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs26xnjBXkk"">began running television advertisements</a> across Pennsylvania, showing pristine farmland and rolling hillsides. The narrator of the commercial insists that America&#39;s oil and gas moves through 2.4 million miles of underground pipelines &ldquo;safely.&rdquo; Ask Beaver County residents &mdash;&nbsp;those who <a href=""https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/09/10/center-township-gas-line-explosion-fire/"">saw the fireball</a>, those who were <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/09/10/natural-gas-pipeline-blast-in-beaver-county-prompts-evacuation/"">forced to evacuate</a>, those who could <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/news/20190111/pipeline-company-buys-properties-near-explosion-site-in-center-twp"">never return home</a> &mdash;&nbsp;how safe pipelines really are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does that sound like a company that is remorseful about its actions in Pennsylvania? Does that sound like a company that has any intention of acknowledging the role it plays in destroying our environment? No, it sounds like a company that is bent on throwing money at a public relations disaster until it goes away, only until another pops up. Rinse and repeat.</p>

PennFuture's Rob Altenburg appointed to DEP committee,7/26/2019,"<p>One of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s foremost experts in air quality issues just got another accolade to add to an already-impressive resume.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rob Altenburg, the director of the PennFuture Energy Center, has previously been invited to testify before the state legislature, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the White House. Now, he&rsquo;s taking his talents back to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the same agency where Rob started his career nearly three decades ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Effective July 1st, DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell appointed Rob to a two-year term on the agency&rsquo;s Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee. In that role, Rob will provide input on regulatory packages and other key proposals from the department&rsquo;s Bureau of Air Quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This won&rsquo;t be his first interaction with the DEP. Rob&rsquo;s first environmental job was with the Bureau of Air Quality, working on new rules to implement the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He focused on calculating and predicting emissions from factories, vehicles, and off-road equipment and was soon working on computer models to predict concentrations of air pollutants. For years, Rob was the primary forecaster for the south central and Lehigh Valley regions of Pennsylvania, deciding if certain days met the parameters for air quality action days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rob attended law school in the evenings while working full time and, after graduation, became an executive policy specialist in DEP&rsquo;s policy office. In that role he advised the governor&rsquo;s office and executive staff on a variety of environmental and public health issues and worked to improve public participation in the department&rsquo;s decision-making.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to his appointment, Rob said he was happy and proud to be given the chance to give back to the agency that gave him a start in the environmental world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very happy to hear from Secretary McDonnell that I&rsquo;ve been appointed to serve on the Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My first environmental job was with the DEP 27 years ago, so I&rsquo;m proud to be able to give something back.&rdquo;</p>

The Opportunity for Green Stormwater Infrastructure in Philadelphia’s Rebuild Initiative,7/18/2019,"<p>By combining the goals of Green City, Clean Waters and the Rebuild Community Infrastructure (Rebuild) Initiative, Philadelphia can align two major infrastructure investments and multiply its investment in its residents, our neighborhoods, and the environment.</p>

<p>The Rebuild Initiative, made possible by the Philadelphia Beverage Tax, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in physical improvements to our neighborhood parks, recreation centers, and libraries. From a list of more than 400 eligible sites, the Rebuild office is prioritizing neighborhoods that face high rates of poverty, drug crime, and poor health outcomes. It is selecting facilities where investment will promote community development and stabilization, as well as sites that are in extremely poor condition. It is currently moving forward on revitalizing <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/programs/rebuild/project-sites/"">more than 50 sites</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to making physical improvements to these sites, Rebuild prioritizes engaging community members in the site planning and design process as well as promoting diversity and economic inclusion through small business and workforce development initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parks, recreation centers, and libraries offer many social and community benefits. Libraries create opportunities for learning and access to important services. Parks and recreation centers are areas where neighbors gather for play, exercise, social interaction and other leisure activities. They also serve as safe spaces for our city&rsquo;s residents. Studies have shown that having access to parks or green space can reduce stress and contribute to improved general psychological health and well-being for people who live or work nearby.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rebuild represents a major investment in our city and its people. Another major city investment &ndash; Green City, Clean Waters &ndash; creates very similar tangible benefits for residents while also creating a cleaner and more resilient environment. Green City, Clean Waters is Philadelphia&rsquo;s 25-year stormwater management program initiated in 2011 that invests primarily in green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) to manage combined sewer overflows. As stormwater runs off roads, parking lots, and roofs it picks up oil, dirt, and other pollutants that make their way to storm drains.</p>

<p>Approximately sixty percent of Philadelphia&rsquo;s storm drain system is a combined system that mixes stormwater with household wastewater. Most large storms cause untreated sewage to overflow directly into local rivers and creeks. The Philadelphia Water Department defines GSI as a &ldquo;soil-water-plant system that intercepts stormwater, infiltrates a portion of it into the ground, evaporates a portion of it into the air, and in some cases releases a portion of it slowly back into the sewer system.&rdquo; GSI tools reduce pollution and flooding events by naturally slowing and filtering rainwater before it enters the city&rsquo;s stormwater system.</p>

<p>Green City, Clean Waters&rsquo; cornerstone is the tangible benefits beyond Clean Water Act compliance that other approaches cannot achieve. GSI implementation has the potential to accomplish substantial triple bottom line benefits&mdash; economic, social, and environmental. GSI creates community green space, revitalizes vacant lots, enhances recreational use, and even has the potential to reduce illegal drug use in public spaces. It decreases heat stress and energy use while improving air quality and contributing to climate change resiliency. It also stabilizes property values and reduces poverty through job creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Water Department (PWD), the agency tasked with implementing Green City, Clean Waters, exerts minimal direct control over city property. PWD cannot accomplish all necessary public GSI projects without strong partnerships with other city agencies and stakeholder communities. Parks and recreation centers are more than just the physical buildings &ndash; they are situated on impervious surfaces and open spaces, thereby providing ideal opportunities to manage stormwater with GSI.</p>

<p>While the Rebuild Initiative process includes a commitment to sustainability, communities can advocate for GSI projects that provide additional benefits. The Rebuild Initiative is prioritizing community engagement to inform the improvements made to facilities. Public participation in GSI and parks and recreation center design is essential for achieving the positive community benefits they are expected to create.</p>

<p>Residents can advocate for GSI in the Rebuild Initiative by attending Rebuild community engagement events, meeting with park advisory committees, friends groups, and civic associations, requesting GSI be implemented in design plans, meeting with their city council members to discuss Rebuild investment, and writing a letter to the editor in support of GSI investment in their Rebuild site.</p>

<p>Green Stormwater Infrastructure is integral to Philadelphia&rsquo;s economy, environment, and social equity. If you agree, please sign our petition <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/keepphillygreenandwatercleancopy1/index.html"">here</a>, which will be delivered to city council.</p>

",Environment; Keep Philly Green & Water Clean,Lena Smith
Six Months That Shifted My World,7/17/2019,"<p>I&rsquo;m still navigating the occurrences of the last six months.</p>

<p>&hellip;on the surface, wave after wave of new climate impact science and data pointing to our rapidly changing planet and the lives of its people. One million species threatened and species extinction accelerating at an unprecedented rate. Record high tides and sunny day floods in our coastal cities, mostly along the East Coast, but also hitting the Gulf of Mexico and Washington state.</p>

<p>&hellip;in the undertow, closer to home, state policymakers torpedoing a policy chance to shore up Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nuclear fleet and hold the line on climate pollution, and missed chances to strengthen the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, both set out to sea because the proposals displease the fracked gas industry.</p>

<p>All around, the climate emergency has settled upon us and our natural systems are fraying -- a jet stream in disarray, record flooding throughout the Commonwealth, a heat wave that delivers the highest temperatures ever recorded in Alaska, record temperatures in France, tornadic threats in the Mid-Atlantic and funnels touching the ground within miles of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>I want to find and give hope through these PennFuture correspondences, but my personal certainty in being able to say that a doomsday future is not inevitable is fading fast. The brutality of the facts and the political reality of our state has moved me. I reckoned with climate change facts a long time ago; it&rsquo;s facing the facts of what is happening in the halls of our state Legislature and executive branch that we must deal with now.</p>

<p>The influence of the fracked gas industry on our Legislature appears to be at stranglehold strength. While we see willingness from many legislators from both sides of the aisle to do the right thing on behalf of our environment, good proposals cannot make it past the solid brick wall that Speaker Mike Turzai has built to protect industry interests, with the help of well-placed anti-environmental committee chairs like Daryl Metcalfe.</p>

<p>The viewpoint of our Governor that Pennsylvania can be part of the climate solution while championing the growth of fracked gas for petrochemicals and dirty energy is incongruous. Is this born of naivete, design or a stubborn unwillingness to face the facts, at least as I see them? Or is the fracked gas industry just too powerful to push back against?</p>

<p>I encounter so many people who are involved with climate issues for the sake of their children and grandchildren and, while not a parent, I have that orientation toward future generations too. And if I pause to project those children of today into an unravelling future 30 years out, I find myself asking how, literally, will they survive? Where will they live and still be sheltered from what surely will become climate chaos if we do not act soon?</p>

<p>This personal sharing comes after six months that also included working with PennFuture&rsquo;s staff and board on our new strategic plan. The plan sets forth a trajectory of action to meet the challenges of our time. Our voice is changing, too, as we place the science of climate change as our North Star, even if it puts into question pragmatism on natural gas issues. Certainly, our changing voice and straight talk may close doors for the organization, but not calling attention to obstacles and calling out obstructionists also closes doors to the solutions we need to avert disaster. Inaction is a far greater risk than aggressive advocacy.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s acknowlege -- for now -- that Pennsylvania is not up to the task of being a climate champion. So far we have been a climate failure. Our energy policy lacks vision, creativity, and contains nothing beyond what the marketplace will take care of on its own without a helping hand from us. In failing to stand up to the fracked gas industry, our elected officials are ceding the health and well-being of our people to corporations, like we have done in decades past when coal ruled the Commonwealth. We&rsquo;ve seemingly learned nothing along the way.</p>

<p>Change must come, and if the Governor and Legislature will not act, the people and organizations like PennFuture must do more. We must speak louder, resist in greater numbers, vote in greater numbers and put unprecedented pressure on these bad actors. We must create change.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have had a chance to interact with many of you over the last six months. All of you have validated the path forward &ndash; through your intellect, your professional pursuits, your bold advocacy, support and friendship. You inspire my passion for this work and that is all I need to work harder every day to make good things happen.</p>

Pennsylvania State Budget Turns Blind Eye to Environment,7/11/2019,"<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-e4d35231-7fff-9e6a-fa32-0d0cbe4b2d7b""></span>Late last month, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a $33.97 billion spending plan that will serve as the financial roadmap for the next fiscal year. The General Assembly passed all accompanying bills and Governor Wolf signed the budget bills into law on June 28 before fleeing Harrisburg for the summer.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">So how does this budget impact our environment?</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">This year&rsquo;s budget was on time, but is it a good plan? Not quite. Especially in a year where there was a budget surplus, Governor Wolf and state lawmakers who approved this budget package should be ashamed for maneuvers that&nbsp;called for cutting funding from critical conservation funding such as the Environmental Stewardship Fund, among others.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Pennsylvania is facing many challenges related to the climate crisis,&nbsp;as well as woefully understaffed and underfunded agencies and a maintenance backlog of hundreds of millions of dollars for our state park and forest system. Despite that, this budget package basically says it&rsquo;s in the best interest of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s citizens to cut even more money from environmental protection and conservation.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">A glaring example is found within the state Department of Environmental Protection, which continues to be staffed at 1994 levels and has seen its funding cut by 30 percent since 2002.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Recent reports show that Pennsylvania should be investing nearly $257 million per year on implementation of best management practices in the Chesapeake Bay watershed alone to meet clean water goals, not to mention millions of dollars more needed to solve our clean water problems in the Delaware and Ohio watersheds and the need to overhaul drinking water systems in our cities.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Pennsylvania farmers received about $6 million in this year&rsquo;s budget for conservation, but that is just a start, and pales in comparison to the dire need of investment. For several years in a row, the river basin commissions in which Pennsylvania participates - like the Susquehanna and Delaware - are receiving well below their full-share funding.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">With the enactment of this year&rsquo;s budget,&nbsp;Pennsylvania&rsquo;s resource agencies saw increases, but nowhere near the needed levels.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""><strong>Take a closer look at the general fund allocations in the budget</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Department of Agriculture saw a $1.5 million increase for the &ldquo;Agricultural Excellence&rdquo; Conservation program and a $3.5 million transfer from General Operations to the Nutrient Management Fund. Overall, the department saw a $19.49 million increase in funding over last year&rsquo;s budget.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources saw an $874,000 decrease for state park operations, a $3.44 million decrease for state forest operations, a $2 million decrease for heritage and other parks, and a $1.6 million decrease for parks and forest infrastructure projects.&nbsp;Overall, the department saw a $19 million increase in funding compared to last year&rsquo;s budget.</li>
	<li>The Department of Environmental Protection saw a $3.67 million decrease in general government operations, a $2.51 million decrease in environmental program management, a $2.67 million decrease in the Chesapeake Bay Agricultural Abatement Program, and an $8.67 million decrease in environmental protection operations.&nbsp;Overall, the department saw a $2.6 million increase compared to last year&rsquo;s budget&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite&nbsp;drastic cuts to both the DEP and DCNR budgets,&nbsp;in earlier proposals, both agencies saw their general funds given increases due to fund transfers and new money found during last-minute budget negotiations, including an injection of $45 million&nbsp;to aid both DEP and DCNR operating budgets. While&nbsp;funding implications and final numbers for the agencies are not yet clear, this&nbsp;should be very positive.</p>

<p><strong>What about code bills?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the appropriations bill and special fund shenanigans, the General Assembly often passes associated &ldquo;code bills&rdquo; that implement the budget across different areas. These code bills are often used to move nefarious pieces of legislation that, by themselves, wouldn&rsquo;t make it through the legislature. Aside from a fairly &ldquo;clean&rdquo; Administrative Code Bill and a Tax Code Bill, which includes a $10 million per year&nbsp; increase for waste coal tax credits, this year&rsquo;s Fiscal Code Bill has a number of troubling provisions. Take a look at a handful of issues below which caused us to raise alarm during the budget negotiations and to further oppose the Fiscal Code legislation in the final days of talks in Harrisburg:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Preemption of Plastics Bans: A provision directs the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee and the Independent Fiscal Office to evaluate the economic and environmental impact of any regulation impacting single-use plastics, reusable plastics, auxiliary containers, wrappings or polystyrene containers and to submit their reports to the General Assembly by July 1, 2020. Until the reports are submitted to the General Assembly, a local governmental body may not pass a law, regulation, or ordinance imposing a tax, fee, or other restrictions on single-use plastics, reusable plastics, auxiliary containers, wrappings or polystyrene containers. Slipped into the Fiscal Code by Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, this language was previously vetoed by Governor Wolf in 2017.</li>
	<li>Changes to the PIPE Program: A part of Speaker Mike Turzai and House Republicans&rsquo; &ldquo;EnergizePA&rdquo; package of legislation (House Bill 1103), this provision provided for the Pipeline Investment Grant Program at the Commonwealth Financing Authority to be changed to allow funding of large residential conversion projects and combined heat and power applications, and the amount of funding applicants can receive was increased to $1.5 million from $1 million. This is yet another buildout of natural gas infrastructure.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Elimination of the Joint Legislative Air and Water Pollution Control and Conservation Committee: A provision calls for repealing the act which, in 1968, created the 51-year-old legislative body on July 1, 2021. The Joint Legislative Conservation Committee has long served as a bipartisan think tank on environmental and conservation policy for the Legislature.</li>
	<li>Transfers of Environmental &amp; Conservation Special Funds: The Fiscal Code called for raiding the Oil &amp; Gas Lease Fund by $69.8 million to pay for general operations at DCNR, seizing $16.1 million from the Environmental Stewardship Fund (&ldquo;Growing Greener&rdquo;), and $10 million from the Recycling Fund to pay for general operations at DEP; a total of $95.9 million taken from special funds for environmental and conservation projects across the Commonwealth.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Looking to the Fall</strong></p>

<p>State legislators have left Harrisburg for the summer, but the House plans to return on September 17th with the Senate joining them on September 23rd. While a hefty amount of bad bills were blocked or pushed back in the busy spring legislative session by PennFuture and our partners, we expect to see a very active fall.</p>

<p>During the week of budget negotiations, the House narrowly passed House Bill 1105, which would create a &ldquo;Consolidated Permit&rdquo; program at DEP and open the door for shortcuts to environmental standards in individual permitting programs. The Pennsylvania Senate also passed Senate Bill 619 by one vote, which amends the Clean Streams Law to severely narrow the definition of &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; and weakens spill-reporting requirements. We will need to continue our fight against these two dangerous bills.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to these bad bills, we will also be fighting proposals to shortcut our permitting processes by sacrificing public health protections, increase fossil fuel subsidies through EnergizePA, weaken clean air and water protections, and rollback conventional oil and gas regulations.</p>

<p>While there will be plenty of bad bills to fight, we will also be working to pass some important new bills that will help fight climate change by advancing clean energy. We will work to expand and extend our Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) &mdash; increasing wind, solar, and other renewables &mdash; as well as giving more people access to clean energy by enabling community solar.</p>

<p>We will also support putting a cap on carbon pollution and implementing a carbon price, possibly by joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and we will advance programs to aid in infrastructure and climate resiliency such as the Governor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Restore Pennsylvania&rdquo; plan.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

PennFuture strongly opposes Tohickon Creek downgrade,7/11/2019,"<p>On July 11, PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team submitted comments to the state Department of Environmental Protection, strongly urging the agency not to downgrade the status of the Tohickon Creek in Bucks County.</p>

<p>The creek, a tributary to the Delaware River, is a natural treasure and provides some of the best recreational opportunities in the area. In addition, the Tohickon Creek watershed sustains hundreds of species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates, many of which are considered rare or threatened.</p>

<p>In comments submitted to DEP, PennFuture attorney Abigail Jones wrote that redesignating waterbodies to a less-restrictive use essentially removes crucial water quality protections that keep those waterbodies clean and pure.</p>

<p>Redesignation, Jones wrote, &ldquo;is an extreme step to take under both federal and state law, and in the case of the lower Tohickon Creek, is inappropriate and unsupported.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DEP&rsquo;s proposal to redesignate the creek is even more confusing when history is factored in. In 1995, the Tinicum Conservancy submitted a petition to have the Tohickon redesignated as an &ldquo;exceptional value&rdquo; stream, the highest classification given to waterbodies.</p>

<p>Instead of considering that upgrade, DEP decided to do the exact opposite in proposing a redesignation that would knock the stream down a classification.</p>

<p>This is unacceptable to us at PennFuture, and unacceptable to many others in the area.</p>

"Artists Interpreting Climate Change, Part 3",6/26/2019,"<p>Last fall I wrote my first of <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-How-Artists-Interpret-Climate-Change-Raise-Awareness"">two blogs</a>&nbsp;on how artists are interpreting climate change, and what some artists are doing to prevent it. I continue to be amazed at the creative ways that artists of all types&mdash; painters, dancers, actors, writers, and musicians &mdash; tackle this issue in their work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Artists-Interpreting-Climate-Change-Part-II"">second blog</a> I wrote about the environmental artist <a href=""http://www.stacylevy.com"">Stacy Levy</a>&nbsp;and the &ldquo;Tide Field&rdquo; installation of caterpillar-like buoys she created for the Schuylkill River. Levy&nbsp;makes projects that show how nature functions in an urban setting.</p>

<p>Her internationally-recognized art showcases the ways natural forces interact with human-made environments and urban ecosystems. She uses her projects to communicate environmental issues, primarily water-related, to the public. These installations often merge science and art that highlight the relationship between nature and the structures humans create. Not only does Levy garner attention with her art, but her constructions present creative solutions for environmental challenges.</p>

<p>If it isn&rsquo;t obvious, I have been a big fan of Levy&rsquo;s work for a while now, so I was absolutely thrilled when she was selected as PennFuture&rsquo;s first Woman of Environmental Arts at last April&rsquo;s 2019 <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2019/03/winners-of-women-in-conservation-awards.html"">Women in Conservation Awards Dinner</a>. PennFuture created The Woman of Environmental Arts Award to honor an individual who utilizes the arts &mdash; visual arts, music, poetry, fiction, theater, dance, as well as the curation or promotion of such arts &mdash; to bring attention to, or address current environmental concerns in Pennsylvania, and Levy was the perfect first recipient.</p>

<p>At the awards dinner Levy said the following:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so honored to be given this Penn Future award for Women in Conservation &mdash; it combines all that I hold dear: art and the environment. Art is not about decorating a place. It is about creating a connection to the place, a conduit of understanding and legibility. And art has a new role, a new function &mdash; art can be the next tool to help repair our damaged environments. It is important to give art a chance to solve issues about storm water drainage, rain infiltration and erosion. Engineers have had this job for years, but they have not always come up with sustainable answers. It is time to give art a place at the table for helping to solve environmental issues.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most difficult challenges I&rsquo;ve seen artists face when dealing with climate change as a subject is how to make it informative without being didactic, accessible to a wide audience, and still make it an aesthetically interesting work of art.</p>

<p>Queens-based artist David Opdyke nailed all three with his installation, <a href=""http://davidopdyke.com"">&ldquo;This Land.&rdquo;</a> The piece had an incredible review in the New York Times last January when it debuted at The University of Michigan Institute for the Humanities in Ann Arbor, where Opdyke is the 2019 Efroymson Emerging Artist in Residence. (Disclosure: The Indianapolis-based Efroymson Family Fund, and one of its trustees, Jeremy Efroymson, have been generous past supporters of projects and organizations I was involved with while living in Indiana.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The work consists of 528 vintage postcards of United States landmarks. They&rsquo;ve been arranged on a grid to create a landscape scene of mountains and a sunset that seems to be crumbling at the bottom &ndash; but when you zoom in you see that each card has been altered, painted with tornadoes, floods, lighting, sea creatures, forest fires, pipelines, traffic jams, deformed frogs, and a lot more &ndash; including blimps announcing that the end is near and advertising a modern-day Ark being built on the shores of Lake Huron &ndash; you get the point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly encourage you to take a look at it <a href=""http://davidopdyke.com"">here</a> and use your mouse to zoom in and out on the individual post cards. The work is in North Dakota right now and will be displayed at the Chicago Humanities Festival this fall. It is one of my favorite works that I have yet to see in person and I would love for it come to Pennsylvania sometime soon!</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;ve been interested in all types of artists, not just visual, and their work focused on environmental issues. And I&rsquo;m a big reader. So, I was excited to see that not just one, but two Pennsylvania authors have recently penned such stories with Susquehanna River as their setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first is <a href=""http://www.brooklenker.com"">Brook Lenker</a>, who has worked in many environmental jobs including at the PA DCNR and Dauphin County Parks and Rec., and was a founder of the Susquehanna River Trail Association. His book &ldquo;The Restorers&rdquo; is a literary river adventure that mixes a bit of Kerouac and Twain with some Carl Hiaasen. The main character, Reily Watters, is on a 556-mile kayak expedition on the Susquehanna wen confronted with a real estate development threatening the river.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Author <a href=""http://joelburcat.com"">Joel Burcat</a>,&nbsp;also an environmental lawyer, wrote the polluted-water legal thriller, &ldquo;Drink to Every Beast.&rdquo; His lead character is PA DEP prosecutor Mike Jacobs. The book is built around his investigation of the death of two teenagers who swam through chemicals illegally dumped into the Susquehanna. I just got my copy and can&rsquo;t wait to dive in.</p>

<p>Also on my personal stack of books to read this summer is Richard Powers&rsquo; novel of environmental activism, &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.richardpowers.net/the-overstory"">The Overstory,</a>&rdquo; which recently won the Pulitzer Prize. (I hear that PennFuture&rsquo;s Director of Policy, Ezra Thrush, is reading it too this summer.) Author Ann Patchett has said that it is&nbsp;&ldquo;the best novel ever written about trees, and really, just one of the best novels, period.&rdquo; That sounds pretty good to me, but it was the rave review I heard from my mother-in-law and my wife (both artists as well), who have recently read it, that sold me. Please, no spoilers!</p>

<p>Creatively exploring environmental issues is not limited to individual artists and writers. The Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh is hosting its first &ldquo;<a href=""http://cmoa.org/event/breathe-better-day"">Breathe Better Day</a>&rdquo; on July 13th to celebrate air quality awareness through art-based lectures and family-friendly activities. Their exhibit Monet and the Modern City will be the basis of learning how artists in the past responded to the rise of industry, and polluted air, when they painted urban industrial landscapes. Wow! As far as I know this is the first museum effort to explore environmental issues and climate change by re-examining art of the past instead of contemporary work. What a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>Speaking of institutions, Hollywood has also made a (mixed) effort at exploring climate change. There is actually a whole category of films now referred to as &ldquo;Cli-Fi.&rdquo; My good friend <a href=""http://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/03/climate-change-in-the-movies-in-2018"">Michael Svoboda</a> has written a number of thoughtful articles about this. I&rsquo;ll only add, and I&rsquo;m certainly not the first to do so, that the most popular movie of the summer, <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, is essentially a movie about (no spoilers, I promise) the dangerous consequences of a ridiculously extreme environmental agenda but with no true solutions offered. In spite of this I really enjoyed it, as long as I didn&rsquo;t think too much about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What exhibits, books, movies or music have you experienced lately that creatively examine climate change and other environmental issue? I&rsquo;d love to hear from you!

The Importance of Agriculture to Clean Water,6/21/2019,"<p>The recent completion of the Pennsylvania draft Phase 3 Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) marks a crossroads for water quality in our local rivers and streams. The WIP &mdash; which more than 100 stakeholders in federal, state, and local governments, as well as non-governmental and governmental agencies, and citizens of Pennsylvania developed through countless hours of research, outreach, and strategic engagement &mdash; outlines how Pennsylvania will work to clean up local waterways.</p>

<p>While the WIP does not meet the pollution reductions necessary to meet Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nitrogen and phosphorus goals, it does meet the pollution requirements necessary for sediment reduction. However, there is a major price tag to fully implement the WIP as it is currently written: as much as $257 million annually, which the state is unlikely to provide.</p>

<p>Four of the top five pollution reduction practices come from the agricultural sector, including agriculture compliance ($33.1 million), soil health ($32.9 million), grass buffers ($9.2 million), and forested buffers ($41.4 million). With over 33,000 farms located in the Pennsylvania portion of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, it cannot be overstated how critical a role agriculture will play in the restoration of our local rivers and streams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s established a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), which mandates a specific amount of pollution that can flow into our waterways by means of stormwater, wastewater, and agricultural runoff. Pennsylvania is drastically far behind in achieving our TMDL, and it is more important than ever for clean water and environmental organizations like PennFuture to work alongside agriculture interest groups to clean up local rivers and streams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public outreach and education will be the key to meeting our pollution reduction goal. PennFuture is working with other environmental organizations and agriculture groups to increase the use of best management practices, such as cover crops and no-till farming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cover crops are used primarily to slow erosion, improve soil health, enhance water availability, smother weeds, help control pests and diseases, increase biodiversity and bring a host of other benefits. Cover crops also reduce runoff, add organic matter to the soil, and increase resilience in the face of erratic and increasingly intensive rainfall, as well as under drought conditions.</p>

<p>No-till farming leaves the soil mostly untouched, which increases levels of crop residue left behind and nearly eliminates soil erosion. No-till also drastically increases water infiltration, which results in less runoff of contaminated water as well as reduces the amount of water needed for crops.</p>

<p>Like most things, conservation practices come at a cost. New equipment to implement best management practices and planting buffers is expensive. And with 6,000 farms closed between 2012 and 2017 due to retirement and declining income, many of which were mid-sized family farms, it is easy to see why there is such hesitancy to adopt new practices. Successfully engaging and building trust within the agriculture community, and increasing the amount of farmers using conservation practices such as cover crops and no-tll,will lead to increased yield, improved soil health, and improved local waterways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The time has come for environmental organizations and agriculture groups to work together to address these issues. We must build trust and alliances within the agricultural community by increasing outreach and public engagement. We must also continue to advocate for increased water quality protection, while simultaneously addressing funding mechanisms to get farmers the resources necessary to implement conservation practices so they can continue to be stewards of their land.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clean water and agriculture interest groups can&rsquo;t restore our waterways individually. Our groups must work together to fully achieve our pollution reduction goals, and it will not be easy. But if we want our children and future generations to enjoy the beauty of our rivers and streams, it is more important than ever to work together.&nbsp;</p>

A Look at the 2018 Draft Integrated Water Quality Report,6/17/2019,"<p>Pennsylvania is a water rich state with approximately 86,000 stream miles connecting more than 700,000 acres of lakes, bays, and wetlands. Protecting and monitoring such a high volume of the Commonwealth&#39;s waterways is a challenging&nbsp;but necessary task.</p>

<p>On June 4, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) closed its public comment period for the 2018 Draft Integrated Water Quality Report (IWQR). You can view the IWQR draft and find your local water body by following <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/CleanWater/WaterQuality/IntegratedWatersReport/Pages/2018-Integrated-Water-Quality-Report.aspx"">this link</a>. These reports are required to be submitted every other year (even numbered years) to comply with two sections of the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act"">U.S. Clean Water Act</a> that require states to report on the overall condition of their aquatic resources and develop a list of all impaired waters in order to prioritize restoration efforts. Pennsylvania is over a year late in preparing its 2018 report. These reports are submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval. PennFuture has submitted comments on this report which can be viewed <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/News/20190603-PF-2018-Integrated-Report-comments.pdf"">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This year, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s draft IWQR has been transformed into a fully digital and online interactive program. Users now have access to numerous maps that show water quality in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s <a href=""https://padep-1.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=9bd2f843c4a44bb1a8ae0d024c66675f"">rivers and streams</a> as well as <a href=""https://padep-1.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=075db9e22ad74546bd5439cc469b1b16"">bays, wetlands, and lakes</a>.</p>

<p>Through these maps, PA DEP can explain why waterways in PA have or have not been determined to be &ldquo;impaired.&rdquo; If a stream or other body of water is determined to be impaired, it is required that the state design a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to restore the water quality for that specific waterbody. According to the EPA, a TMDL is a regulatory term identifying the maximum amount of a pollutant that a body of water can receive while still meeting water quality standards.</p>

<p>The next IWQR will be released in Spring 2020. Besides these reports there are more opportunities to make your voice heard. It is essential for the public to participate when there are rule-making comment opportunities. Public comments strengthen regulations, create a comprehensive and accurate record, and support an appropriate and informed decision-making process. Written public comments can be as short or in-depth as the submitter chooses, but here are a few tips and techniques from PennFuture that can help make comments effective:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use specific examples and highlight how the regulations could impact you, your family, your community, and the natural resources you love.</li>
	<li>Use persuasive language throughout.</li>
	<li>Present your comments in a clear, concise, and respectful manner.</li>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s comments opposing the Dirty Water Rule can be found <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/files/admin/2019_04_15-PennFuture-WOTUS-Public-Comments-EPA-HQ-OW-2018-0149.pdf"" target=""“_blank”"">here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, PennFuture engaged more than 1,400 people, each of whom submitted comments opposing the proposed gutting of the Clean Water Act. Nationally, more than 300,000 people submitted comments.</p>

<p>Since taking office in 2017, President Trump has made the attack on the 2015 Clean Water Rule a priority for his administration. The 2015 Clean Water Rule clarified the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s jurisdiction and reduced uncertainty, as well as protected critical waters throughout Pennsylvania and across America.</p>

<p>PennFuture strongly supported the promulgation of the Clean Water Rule because it was supported by the legislative history of the Clean Water Act, it would protect drinking water supplies used by millions of Pennsylvanians, and it would protect sensitive and critical headwaters and wetlands, which, in turn, protect the water quality for thousands of stream miles in the Commonwealth. The Clean Water Rule also relied on a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; test to determine jurisdiction of certain waters. The significant nexus test recognized the importance of biological, chemical, and physical influence of waters as a basis of Clean Water Act protections.</p>

<p>In contrast, the proposed Dirty Water Rule is not based on science at all but is a capitulation to big industry interests, making it easier for them to pollute our nation&rsquo;s waters. The Dirty Water Rule is based on an extremely limited dictionary definition of the term &ldquo;water,&rdquo; which was taken to mean only relatively permanent standing or flowing waters. Additionally, the term &ldquo;adjacent wetlands&rdquo; was restricted to mean only those wetlands that physically touch or have a direct hydrological surface connection to other &ldquo;waters of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Consequently, the proposed Dirty Water Rule would eliminate protections for some of our most critical waters, especially wetlands and ephemeral (rain dependent) streams. These waters provide numerous benefits for local wildlife and ecology and provide the clean water source for many of our drinking water systems. For this and the other reasons set forth in our comments, PennFuture strongly opposed the Dirty Water Rule as a dire threat to the significant progress we have made under the Clean Water Act toward restoring and conserving our nation&rsquo;s waters.</p>

<p>While this was the final step in the &ldquo;repeal and replace&rdquo; of the 2015 Clean Water Rule&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; (see <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Opposes-Any-Repeal-of-the-Clean-Water-Rule"" target=""“_blank”"">here</a> for PennFuture&rsquo;s comments on the repeal stage), the proposed Dirty Water Rule must be finalized by the federal agencies after reviewing and responding to all the comments. PennFuture anticipates a flurry of litigation to follow finalization of the Dirty Water Rule, and we will keep you posted about what happens next.</p>

New Definition of “Waters of the United States” Threatens Clean Water Act Protections,3/26/2019,"<p>On February 14, 2019, the federal agencies tasked with regulating our nation&rsquo;s waters under the Clean Water Act &ndash; the US Environmental Protection Agency and US Army Corps of Engineers &ndash; issued a new definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States,&rdquo; which will dramatically limit the protections of the Clean Water Act.</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-02-14/pdf/2019-00791.pdf"" target=""“_blank”"">proposed rule</a>, aptly nicknamed the &ldquo;Dirty Water Rule,&rdquo; would, among other things, remove federal protections from ephemeral waters (those that flow only in response to precipitation events) and those wetlands that lack a direct physical or surface hydrological connection to protected waters. These waters are important not only for their own ecological roles, but they are critical for providing cleaner water downstream. Nationally, approximately <a href=""https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/12/epa-claims-no-data-impact-weakening-water-rule-numbers-exist"" target=""“_blank”"">18% of our nation&rsquo;s streams and over half of the wetlands</a> could lose federal protections under the Dirty Water Rule. More concerning is that the federal government has <i>no idea</i> what the impacts will be to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s water resources!</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s most alarming about the Dirty Water Rule is that the gutting of the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s protections is <i>not based in either science or the law</i>. Rather, it is a capitulation to big industry, making it easier for them to pollute some of our most critical headwaters and wetlands. The Dirty Water Rule will jeopardize over 40 years of successes under the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s mandate to protect the biological, chemical, and physical integrity of our nation&rsquo;s waters.</p>

D.C. Visit Marks Success for the Chesapeake Bay,3/15/2019,"<p>PennFuture and clean water advocates from across Pennsylvania teamed up on March 6 for the annual <a href=""https://www.choosecleanwater.org/""><u><strong>Choose Clean Water Coalition (CCWC) </strong></u></a> Chesapeake Bay Day on the Hill.</p>

<p>Our mission was to advocate for increased funding for vital legislation that would improve water quality across the Bay watershed. Federal programs, such as the Chesapeake Small Watershed Grants (SWG) and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), provide critical financial resources that help local governments and farmers reduce pollution flowing into our waterways. At the Capitol, we asked our congressional representatives to ensure that local governments receive the funds they need to meet pollution reduction goals by: increasing Chesapeake Bay Program Funding, substantially increasing funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF), and fully funding the conservation programs in the Farm Bill in fiscal year 2020.</p>

<p>Chesapeake Bay Program grants such as the SWG and the Innovative Nutrient Sediment Reduction Grants (INSR) provide critical on-the-ground restoration at the local level. By increasing funding levels the Bay Program receives, additional resources can be allocated toward local communities and non-profit organizations to improve local water quality. These additional funds are necessary for Pennsylvania to meet its 2025 Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirement, which is a pollution limit all states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed must meet.</p>

<p>Additionally, we asked our Congressional delegation to substantially increase funding for the SRF, and include it in any future Federal Infrastructure Spending Plan. The Clean Water SRF is an essential piece of funding that provides low interest loans to local governments for clean water infrastructure projects to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution for wastewater treatment and stormwater facilities, and nonpoint sources of pollution such as farms and developments.</p>

<p>Finally, the CCWC team asked for support to fully fund the conservation programs in the Farm Bill in fiscal year 2020. You can read more about PennFuture&rsquo;s recap on the Farm Bill by checking out our blog from December titled, &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Final-Farm-Bill-Signed-into-Law-Marks-Big-Win-for-Conservation""><u><strong> Final Farm Bill Signed into Law Marks Big Win for Conservation</strong></u></a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Among the many decision makers who represent districts in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, we met with Pennsylvania Representatives Lloyd Smucker, John Joyce, Scott Perry, Glenn &ldquo;G.T.&rdquo; Thompson, and Matt Cartwright and their staffs, each of whom carefully listened to our concerns. Finally, we also had the honor of meeting with Senator Bob Casey, who introduced legislation that became the CREP section of the Farm Bill, which will help farmers and landowners install more riparian forest buffers and maintain them.</p>

Final Farm Bill Signed into Law Marks Big Win for Conservation,12/21/2018,"<p>President Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the Farm Bill. Aside from being a critical piece of legislation for farming subsidies and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Farm Bill is the largest source of conservation funding in the federal government.</p>

<p>What started as two very different versions of the Farm Bill in the House of Representatives and the Senate, the final Farm Bill passed last week in Congress provided no cuts, and even some modest increases, to conservation funding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike the previous House version of the Farm Bill, the final legislation did not contain any harmful policy riders, including provisions undermining bedrock environmental laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water Act. The final Farm Bill is also without an attack on our national forests and a weakened Forestry Title, which would have made it easier for industry and polluters to do business without being held accountable and expressly make environmental considerations for their work. Environmental and conservation advocates made the key difference here.</p>

<p>As a part of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, the Regional Conservation Partnerships Program&rsquo;s (RCPP) mandatory funding was increased from $100 million to $300 million annually, and Critical Conservation Areas, like the Chesapeake Bay watershed, will see a significant boost in funding for projects proposed by farmers and landowners in the watershed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We offer sincere thanks to Senator Bob Casey (D-PA). As a result of his work in the Senate, the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) Improvement Act of 2018, S.2978, and the Chesapeake Bay Enhancements Act of 2017, S.2139, made it into the final Farm Bill. CREP is a critical program for getting forest riparian buffers planted in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which is a substantial part of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). This provision requires that 8.6 million acres of CREP land be enrolled through CREP agreements and other continuous enrollment categories.</p>

<p>Further, this bill maintains robust funding for agricultural conservation easements across the Commonwealth and goes a long way to protect and restore clean water in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and all of Pennsylvania. PennFuture and clean water partners worked closely with Senator Casey and his staff to advocate for his CREP provisions and we are grateful to see this crucial part included in the final language signed into law Thursday. We also thank Congressman Glenn &ldquo;GT&rdquo; Thompson (R-PA-5) for his leadership in ensuring a final Farm Bill that is strong in conservation, clean water, and sustainable agriculture through the entire Conference Committee process.</p>

<p>The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 signed Thursday will substantially aid Pennsylvania&rsquo;s farmers and landowners in meeting clean water goals and will improve conservation efforts to protect water quality throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. From Pine Creek to the Pequea, from the Loyalsock to the Conococheague, the impact of this Farm Bill will be felt throughout Pennsylvania and our land and water will be better for it.&nbsp;</p>

Reducing Methane Pollution Requires Action Now,12/19/2018,"<p>On Thursday, Dec. 13, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) took an important step towards controlling air pollution from the more than 7,000 existing unconventional natural gas wells in the state. They presented to their Air Quality Technical Advisory Committee (AQTAC) a draft proposed rulemaking that, while focused on reducing emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), will also help control methane emissions.</p>

<p>While the proposal is a positive step, the time to act on reducing methane emissions is quickly running out.&nbsp; As the graph below shows (1), the switch from coal to natural gas has reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the state, but this has come at a cost of increased natural gas emissions.&nbsp; While it may be three or four years before the emissions from natural gas electricity generation exceed that of coal, that does not consider leakage during gas production.&nbsp; When the industry&rsquo;s self-reported leakage emissions are added in, natural gas may be responsible for more carbon pollution than coal as early as next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/methane1219%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 468px; height: 284px;"" /></p>

<p>Considering the actual leakage from the gas industry might be as much as five times higher than what is being reported, and the Federal government is actively trying to eliminate the regulation of methane emissions altogether, it&rsquo;s even more important for the state to take action and directly regulate methane emissions.</p>

<p>Reducing methane leakage is not only critical for our health and the environment, it is also good for the industry.&nbsp; Some companies recognize that investing in cleaner technology will save money in the long run, but without strong regulations, others will always be tempted to cut corners in search of short-term gains.&nbsp; State action on methane can help level the playing field, preventing short-sighted companies from undercutting those trying to do the right thing.</p>

<p>Governor Wolf deserves credit for the steps that have already been taken to reduce methane emissions from new sources, and he further deserves credit for this most recent positive step. But, until we can cross the finish line and get these emissions under control the work is not done.</p>

<p>While Governor Wolf has a unique opportunity to take action, each of us has a responsibility to help were we can.&nbsp; Reducing carbon pollution isn&rsquo;t going to be easy and climate change deniers will be opposed to every step we take.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t all install solar panels or buy an electric car, but we can all remind our elected officials at the state and federal level that we expect them to defend our right to a clean and healthy environment.&nbsp;</p>

Save the Land and Water Conservation Fund,12/17/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Steve Hegedus, President of the Tri-County Trout Club</strong></em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m the President of the Tri-County Trout Club, representing Allegheny, Armstrong and Westmoreland counties. Based out of Lower Burrell, PA, our organization&rsquo;s objective is to educate anglers for the purpose of enhancing the trout fishing experience and preserving our trout fisheries so that they may be passed on for the continued enjoyment of future generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We do this through environmental education and awareness, involvement in environmental projects, and the education of adults and youngsters on the many techniques, forms and pleasures of fishing. Our club is especially sensitive to any issues that threaten the future of trout fishing, our fisheries, and the environment, and we try to combat these threats in whatever way we are able.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/lwcfcopy1/index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=d1632337-b691-4718-8bab-a0972c92f4e2""><strong>Congress choosing to not renew the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a bipartisan program that has helped protect sensitive wildlife habitat, cultural heritage areas and outdoor recreation areas across the entire U.S., is one of those threats.</strong></a></p>

<p>I grew up in Upper Burrell. There, I hunted, ran a trapline and developed my appreciation for the outdoors, and while fragmented woodlots could make trespassing an issue in some spots, I also was lucky to have public parks with lakes for fishing and access to stocked trout waters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After learning more about the LWCF, I was surprised to find out that one of the places I used to fish with my friends in junior high was a beneficiary of the LWCF &ndash; Burrell Lake Park, in the city of Lower Burrell, A.K.A. Holtzhauer&rsquo;s Pond &ndash; and it&rsquo;s also where my club meets each month and where we hold our Kids&rsquo; Fishing Derby every year - all of this from one LWCF project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In college, I had the chance to hunt on some of our State Game Lands, which have also been increased through acquisitions funded by LWCF.&nbsp; When I started fly fishing, one of the streams where I first &ldquo;got my feet wet&rdquo; was Nesshannock Creek, and you guessed it, also a recipient of LWCF funds. One of my favorite destinations when I first started fly fishing was Loyalhanna Creek in the Loyalhanna Gorge near Ligonier, a natural area which was purchased using LWCF funds. Maybe you don&rsquo;t fly fish &ndash; maybe you like to fish in the river. To fish the Allegheny River near my home, the access areas are at Tarentum or Springdale, and both access points were recipients of LWCF funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I could continue, but I think you get the point. If you enjoy the outdoors, it would be hard to avoid all of the areas in PA that have benefited from this program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the Land and Water Conservation fund is not renewed, then hundreds of needed conservation projects will have no funding. Special wildlife habitat areas that are at risk of being developed will be threatened, and our country&rsquo;s ability to conserve lands for future generations of outdoors people will be greatly undermined. Increasingly, our valuable natural areas are becoming fragmented, and are being lost due to encroachment by development. LWCF offers a way to save more of them now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After 54 years of success, now is NOT the time - especially for such a bi-partisan issue - to allow this valuable program to fade away. Let&rsquo;s permanently renew the Land and Water Conservation Fund now with full funding.&nbsp;</p>

Partnerships Created Change this Year and Will Carry us into 2019,12/17/2018,"<div>&quot;Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much&quot; said Helen Keller. At PennFuture, we collaborate with partner organizations to execute our work, we rely on our activists to amplify our work at the local level, and integral to it all is financial support from individual and institutional funding partners.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PennFuture&rsquo;s pro-environment agenda moved forward in 2018 with the help of partner organizations who we teamed up with in coalitions focusing on our top issues, including clean energy, methane, climate, Delaware River water quality and Chesapeake Bay watershed restoration.&nbsp;And while some diversity among the groups&#39; goals is a good thing, it&rsquo;s essential that as much as possible, these groups pull in the same direction.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s gratifying to see what can happen when a coalition of national, regional, state and local groups representing advocacy, watershed restoration, land protection, recreation &ndash; to name a few interest groups - come together to create changes that protect our environment.&nbsp;By necessity, many of the organizations around the table in these coalitions also come together to push back against egregious legislation, such as the regulatory rollbacks that were attempted in 2018 and that are expected to return in 2019.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania worked with a host of other &ldquo;c (4)&rdquo; partner organizations, including Sierra Club, to help elect the most pro-environmental class of new state legislators in a very long time. Many of the c (4) groups also successfully worked for the re-election of Governor Tom Wolf.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>As we move into 2019, strong partnerships must persist. As the state affiliate of National Wildlife Federation, PennFuture enjoys an exclusive partnership in which both organizations leverage the other&rsquo;s bases and access to national and state policymakers into a powerful alliance. This kind of power-building is essential to fighting the Trump Administration&rsquo;s ongoing attacks on environmental protections and achievements.&nbsp;The latest assault is the Trump EPA&rsquo;s rewrite of rules protecting the &ldquo;Waters of the United States.&rdquo; The Administration, with support from its partners &ndash; including&nbsp; American Farm Bureau, National Homebuilders, National Mining Association and National Association of Manufacturing &ndash; plans to strip away protection from large segments of&nbsp; watersheds, disrupting hydrologic functions needed for clean and abundant water, and for climate resilience.&nbsp;PennFuture&rsquo;s partnership with National Wildlife Federation extends into our Delaware, Chesapeake and climate coalitions and campaigns.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Here in Pennsylvania, the environmental community aspires to tackle some big issues in 2019.&nbsp;A resurging Growing Greener Coalition - a large group comprised of local, regional, and statewide conservation, recreation, and preservation groups &ndash; will be working with PennFuture and others to advocate for replenishing critical Growing Greener funding needed for land protection, watershed conservation, recreation and preservation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The very symbol of our partnerships, Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda, forged by 26 groups and carried forward through PennFuture&rsquo;s Green in 18 campaign, will move into 2019 as a series of policy recommendations for the Wolf Administration.&nbsp;We are hoping the new class of pro-environmental state legislators making their way to Harrisburg will be the newest of our partners, allies and collaborators so that together, we can move forward exciting policies for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

The Cost of Replacing Nuclear Power with Natural Gas,12/13/2018,"<p>The Pennsylvania Legislature&rsquo;s Nuclear Caucus released its <a href=""http://nuclearenergy.pasenategop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2018/11/Nuclear-Energy-Caucus-Report-November-2018.pdf""><u><strong>2017 &ndash; 18 Bicameral Nuclear Energy Caucus Report</strong></u></a> in November, making the case for preserving our state&rsquo;s existing nuclear power plants and to outline potential policy solutions. While their report is more of an advocacy piece in support of nuclear generation than a neutral assessment of the issues, it raises important issues around the role of nuclear power in meeting our climate goals and their part in a reliable power grid.</p>

<p>Currently, Pennsylvania has five operating nuclear plants and ranks second in the nation in nuclear generating capacity. Of those five plants, two are scheduled for closure&mdash;the 819 megawatt (MW) Three Mile Island Generating Station (TMI) in Dauphin County and the 1,826 MW Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station in Beaver County.</p>

<p>Unlike fossil fuel plants, where up to 90 percent of the marginal operating costs can be for fueling its boilers, turbines, etc., with coal or gas, nuclear plants have high fixed costs (i.e. a plant is expensive to build) and relatively low marginal operating costs (i.e. nuclear plants cost almost as much when they are idle as when they run.) They are well designed for the traditional role of &ldquo;baseload&rdquo; generation where they run at or near their capacity as often as possible, but this also means that they rarely set the price of the electricity market. Rather, natural gas plants that can ramp their electricity output up and down to reflect demand most often sets the market price. As a result, nuclear plant profits are strongly influenced by external factors, such as the glut of natural gas prices driving down market prices.</p>

<p>The most at-risk plants are single-unit nuclear reactors, like TMI or the Davis-Besse and Perry Nuclear Power Stations in Ohio. These have higher operating costs per megawatt-hour than plants with multiple units and, not surprisingly, all three of these plants are scheduled to retire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We should not minimize the impacts on jobs and the local communities as these plants retire, but our state&rsquo;s nuclear fleet is aging with no real prospect of any new plants being built to replace them&mdash;these are not problems we can avoid indefinitely. It makes sense that the legislature is concerned, but the big question though is what, if anything, they should do about it? Beyond the jobs issue, two major concerns are the impacts on climate change and electric reliability.</p>

<p><strong>Climate Change</strong></p>

<p>The Caucus report makes the claim that, &ldquo;Existing nuclear plants are a critical component of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, and nuclear plant closures are devastating to greenhouse gas goals.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a strong statement, but looking at the data, it&rsquo;s fair.</p>

<p>In our region, most of the carbon pollution comes from the electricity generating sector. Those emissions have declined 24 percent between 2005 and 2016, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the problem has been solved. Thanks to the retirement of a number of large coal-fired power plants, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal dropped more than 53% or 68 million tons over the period. Unfortunately, to make up for the lost generation, GHG emissions from natural gas rose by more than 25 million tons over the period. If that trend continues, replacing all the remaining coal with gas generation may only reduce emissions another 25 million tons.</p>

<p>Replacing the zero-carbon generation from the TMI and Beaver Valley nuclear plants with more carbon-intensive natural gas generation will, on the other hand, increase carbon pollution in Pennsylvania more than 9 million tons per year. If we were to lose all five nuclear plants and replace them with natural gas, that would more than eliminate any gains from retiring the remaining coal fleet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While clean, renewable generation has the technical potential to replace the lost nuclear generation, the problem is timing. Three Mile Island, for example, is scheduled to close on September 30, 2019. To take its place alone, we would need to more than double&mdash;and maybe much more than double&mdash;our renewable energy generation. That is just not going to happen in time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reliability</strong></p>

<p>The other strong claim from the Caucus Report is that, &ldquo;While today&rsquo;s grid can withstand extreme conditions, tomorrow&rsquo;s grid without the reliability and resiliency of nuclear power could, &lsquo;result in material levels of generation unavailability and load shedding.&rsquo;&rdquo; In other words, losing nuclear generation could result in power shortages resulting in blackouts. In this case, &ldquo;could&rdquo; is the operative word. The real issue isn&rsquo;t if the loss of nuclear generation&mdash;the source of almost a third of our in-state generation&mdash;could cause reliability issues. The question is if that is likely to create problems that our existing grid and other tools can&rsquo;t handle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our grid operator, PJM Interconnection, conducts a reliability analysis when any power plant retires. If they find the plant is needed, PJM can request it remain in operation temporarily until system upgrades, like new generation or improved transmission lines, can be completed.&nbsp; In exchange for this temporary continued operation, such plants can receive above-market rates for their energy. While tools like this are out there to address potential reliability issues, they are often not needed. In the case of TMI and Beaver Valley, PJM has completed analysis and found that they can retire as scheduled.</p>

<p>Barring some unforeseen incident, we&rsquo;ll probably have at least three-years notice before any of the other three plants retire and maybe much more than three years. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that these plants don&rsquo;t provide some added reliability, but without quantifying this benefit more precisely, it&rsquo;s hard to judge what it is worth to ratepayers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Policy Choices Moving Forward</strong></p>

<p>Balancing these fundamental truths in upcoming policy choices is critical. In the short run, replacing nuclear plants with natural gas severely hurts efforts to address climate change. Nonetheless, in the long run, replacing nuclear and fossil fuel generation with clean, renewable energy and greater energy efficiency is the only sustainable pathway. Finding a middle ground depends on whether there are ways to extend the life of these nuclear plants in a cost-effective manner, buying valuable time to deploy even more cost effective and clean renewables sources.</p>

Scrooge and Year End Giving,12/12/2018,"<p>Charitable giving has been tied to the end of year holidays since at least 1843 when Charles Dickens published &ldquo;A Christmas Carol.&rdquo; Who doesn&rsquo;t remember the opening scene when the charity collectors show up at Scrooge&rsquo;s office and ask for a donation?</p>

<p>&quot;At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,&quot; said the gentleman, taking up a pen, &quot;it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and Destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>Scrooge replies that he believes the government programs&mdash;prisons, workhouses, and poverty laws&mdash;are sufficient to take care of those in need. They are not. As Scrooge discovers that evening when visited by the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future: charity is still necessary, especially at the end of the year.</p>

<p>It is through charitable giving that Scrooge understands the meaning of the holiday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And he did it without any concern for end-of-year tax-deductions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not that these deductions aren&rsquo;t important, too. Maximizing tax-deductions is a practical consideration that should be taken into account when making a donation, but it isn&rsquo;t the main reason most people give at the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A number of studies over the past few years have analyzed why people give to charity and rarely does &ldquo;tax-deduction&rdquo; even make it into the top ten. People give because they truly want to help people in need, and they give to make a difference in their community, and they give to support causes they believe in. We give because we believe it makes a difference. And we give because it makes us feel good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet, even though we know it is the right thing to do, many of us don&rsquo;t give throughout the year and choose instead to wait until the holidays. And that&rsquo;s okay. If you&rsquo;ve waited until now to make your annual charitable contributions, you&rsquo;re in good company! Almost a third of all charitable giving takes place in December, and for many organizations, this year-end giving accounts for anywhere from a quarter to half of their donations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We give at the end of the year because it makes us feel good to give during the holidays. Whether you celebrate Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa, the winter solstice, or something else (Festivus?) during these cold, dark days at the end of the year, we are all celebrating our community and sharing gratitude with our loved ones.</p>

<p>Tax-deductions are nice, and appreciated, but that&rsquo;s not why Scrooge gave. He gave because it made him feel as light as a feather, happy as an angel, merry as a school-boy, and giddy as a drunken man. He gave because it made him feel good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us!&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>All of us at PennFuture thank you for your giving, and wish you peace, love, and joy during this wonderful holiday season, and a happy new year!</p>

"Despite Trump, We Will Act on Climate",11/28/2018,"<p>Under the veil of a tryptophan-tainted Black Friday, our government released the Fourth National Climate Assessment.&nbsp;If the climate deniers in Washington, D.C. who played out the timing of the report&rsquo;s release were hoping our brains would be so mesmerized by the prospect of great shopping bargains, or still substantially hung over from Thanksgiving feasting&nbsp;for us to pay attention to the document, they couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong.&nbsp;Here we are in the week after the release of the assessment, and it is still getting plenty of play. Why might that be? Despite the report&rsquo;s piercing truth in calling out the profound impacts on specific communities, and the straight line it draws between climate impacts and the ultimate toll it will take on our economy and livelihoods, the real reason the report is alive and vibrant is that the people of our country care deeply about this issue, and its impacts are hitting home, and frequently.</p>

<p><strong>I believe in the last week the window for climate action has been thrown open wider and we will see an acceleration in climate action, and very soon.</strong>&nbsp;I believe that long time clarion climate champions and warriors &ndash; including remarkable individuals associated with PennFuture such as our board member and renowned scientist Michael Mann, past-president Larry Schweiger, and our current chair Char Magaro, who is almost singularly focused on helping communities address climate &ndash; will soon be joined by new champions. I am hoping newly re-elected Governor Tom Wolf and Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman will emerge with a vision and plan to take on climate here in Pennsylvania and will move stronger policy solutions.&nbsp;I see climate-forward businesses with interests in our state, such as NextEra Energy Resources, Mars and Dansko stepping up even higher. They are being joined by myriads more to lead the private sector.&nbsp;Climate leaders in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s legislature like Leanne Krueger-Braneky and members of the Climate Solutions caucus, are being joined by newly elected pro-environment candidates, including Danielle Friel Otten, Lindsey Williams, Sara Innamorato, Summer Lee, Chris Sappey, Melissa Shusterman, Tim Kearney, and Steve Santarsiero.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Statement-Petition-Process-on-Carbon-Emissions-a-Positive-Step-Toward-Fighting-Climate-Change-on-State-Level""><strong>PennFuture was proud to support and sign onto the Clean Air Council&rsquo;s petition to the Environmental Quality Board to limit carbon pollution.</strong></a> This petition offers a pathway towards our climate goals and is a backstop to legislative inaction.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the PA Department of Environmental Protection, in partnership with PennFuture and a team of facilitators and stakeholders, <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/SolarFuture/Pages/Pennsylvania%27s-Solar-Future-Plan.aspx""><strong>released Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future Plan</strong></a> to realize more potential for solar energy generation in-state. The plan was crafted and shaped with very significant public participation and presents a viable path forward. Several elements of the plan have already been implemented, including enabling commercial property-assessed clean energy (C-PACE) and encouraging in-state solar development, but there is more that can be done. The work continues on, enabling community solar in Pennsylvania and renewing and strengthening our Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards.</p>

<p>Climate must be further attacked and on multiple scales. Beyond energy, we need to be looking at transportation, agriculture, methane, and other sources and causes. Pennsylvania is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gas in the country and for far too long, we have turned a blind eye to that fact. It is our obligation and responsibility&mdash;now, without further delay&mdash;to each other and future generations to make things better here. Fossil fuel extraction in Pennsylvania&mdash;oil, coal and now gas&mdash;are embedded in our geology, and in the DNA of our communities and economy. The industries associated with extraction have enjoyed primacy here for over 100 years and many elected officials have served at its pleasure.&nbsp;Now, that must begin to change.&nbsp;We must make the hard decisions to diversify our economy, regulate pollution, protect our water, improve our air, and address the climate catastrophe among us.&nbsp;I feel a shift and emboldening and it is long overdue.</p>

Giving Thanks for Open Spaces and Fighting for LWCF,11/27/2018,"<div>Every good thing in life doesn&rsquo;t shout out, &ldquo;Look at me! Look at me!&rdquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I think that&rsquo;s what makes this season of Thanksgiving and merriment so important: it&rsquo;s a time for reflection. It&rsquo;s a time to look back on the last year of your life and actively seek out the good things you&rsquo;ve been given, the things you&rsquo;ve learned or the important things that have happened to you. It&rsquo;s a time to count the ways &ndash; however big or small &ndash; in which you&rsquo;ve been shown kindness or love or friendship. It&rsquo;s a time to take hold of the light and harness it for the depths of winter.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>For me, oddly enough, one of the things I&rsquo;m most grateful this year is a campaign I&rsquo;ve been working on over the last four months to push for the reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>While working on this campaign, I&rsquo;ve realized this outdoor recreation and conservation program has been with me for my entire life, giving me spaces to run and hike, to think and heal, and to learn about the natural world around me.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>It was with me every Sunday that my younger brother and sister had a youth soccer game at the Ed Meyer Recreation Complex in Titusville, PA. It was there when I had the opportunity to intern with the U.S. Forest Service as a Biological Surveyor for the Jake&rsquo;s Rocks Epic Mountain Bike Trail in the Allegheny National Forest. It even followed me to graduate school in Boone, North Carolina, when the first hiking trail I ever went on was the Glenn Burney Trail in Blowing Rock, an LWCF-funded site.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>When I look back at my life, I can see traces of the Land and Water Conservation Fund everywhere I go. It&rsquo;s a constant reminder that the recreation complexes, open spaces, and historical sites we visit don&rsquo;t just magically appear. They&rsquo;re planned. They&rsquo;re given to us.&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>For that, I am forever grateful.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Gratitude as an Attitude,11/20/2018,"<p>As I&rsquo;m sure many of you do, every year when I gather with my family for Thanksgiving we each take a turn&nbsp;before we eat, going around the table (or the room if the extended family is there too!) to say what each of us is thankful for. It is a simple&nbsp;and beautiful tradition, and one that can also produce some laughs (the uncle who is thankful for beer and football comes to mind), and sometimes it causes anxiety.</p>

<p>Honestly sharing our feelings with a group of people, even those who we are closest to, can be embarrassing or uncomfortable for some.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;ve been a bit stressed for the past week just thinking about what I want to say I&rsquo;m grateful for this year. Not that I have a problem myself with sharing&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t be writing this blog if I did. No, I want to make sure I get it right. I mean, we only get one chance a year to get the spotlight and share like this and I want it to be a good one!</p>

<p>And then the absurdity of it hits me: I&rsquo;m getting stressed out by trying to decide what I&rsquo;m grateful for. Gratitude isn&rsquo;t supposed to make you stressed&mdash;it is supposed to make you happy!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>There have been many psychological studies and popular books written on gratitude during the past decade or so that all basically conclude the same thing: the common trait shared by happy people is gratitude.</strong> (If you search &ldquo;Gratitude and Happiness,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll find tons of these available online.) In what is called &ldquo;positive psychology&rdquo; research, studies show that expressing gratitude on a regular basis can actually improve one&rsquo;s health as well as increase&nbsp; a person&rsquo;s ability to have a positive outlook. Gratitude creates satisfaction. And having this positive outlook on life improves our ability to encounter adversity and stress in a healthy manner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yep, I was doing it all wrong. By only focusing on one thing to feel gratitude for on one day, I was creating stress. Instead, by being mindful and expressing gratitude regularly (daily!) we recognize the good in our lives that we are fortunate to have. Recognizing&nbsp;and expressing gratitude&nbsp;becomes an attitude and a way of living.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Latin root of gratitude is gratia, which also means grace. Being gracious means being courteous and thoughtful to others. It means recognizing that often the source of good in our lives lies at least partially outside of ourselves. This source can be many things of course: family, work, nature, or a higher power. And, it can be charitable nonprofit organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Nonprofit organizations&mdash;whether they are working towards improving the environment, or feeding the hungry, or rescuing a dog, or providing shelter during a disaster, or making the world more beautiful through the arts&mdash;have my gratitude. </strong>Charitable groups, such as PennFuture, do what few of us can do as individuals. By bringing together voices and our resources, nonprofits amplify our voices to have a collective impact. That is the amazing power of nonprofits, and why we support them. And why we should be grateful for them.</p>

<p><strong>And as the Director of Development for PennFuture, I have the very wonderful job of graciously helping to connect supporters of environmental causes to the work that PennFuture does.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>So, what am I going to say I&rsquo;m grateful for on this Thanksgiving?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for my family and the love and support they give me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for nonprofits that do the work that I can&rsquo;t do as an individual.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m grateful for PennFuture for the work the amazing staff does to promote clean air, water, and energy in Pennsylvania.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for PennFuture for giving me the opportunity to share this work with others.</p>

<p><strong>And I&rsquo;m very grateful for you, for your support of PennFuture&rsquo;s work. Because we couldn&rsquo;t do it without you. Thank you!</strong></p>

<p>But this Thanksgiving, I think I&rsquo;m going to say that I&rsquo;m most grateful that we have a national holiday to celebrate gratitude &ndash; and how it reminded me how important it is to be grateful every day. <strong>Gratitude as an attitude &ndash; live it every day!</strong></p>

<p>And, Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

Clean Water Advocacy Workshop Teaches Participants to Take Action,11/19/2018,"<p>On Saturday, Nov. 10, PennFuture and Trout Unlimited hosted a workshop at Wildwood Park&rsquo;s Benjamin Olewine III Nature Center in Harrisburg to discuss the Farm Bill, Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort, stream redesignation, and to conduct hands-on workshops for participants interested in water advocacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The workshop began with PennFuture and Trout Unlimited giving an overview of important priority areas that we are focused on, along with an overview of why we decided to host the event. After the initial introduction concluded, we divided the attendees into two different groups, where we then began our workshops.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Trout Unlimited&rsquo;s workshop, conducted by Mid-Atlantic Policy Director David Kinney and Mid-Atlantic Organizer Robert Shane, provided an overview and hands-on training about how to write opinion pieces and letters to the editor for newspapers and publications about clean water issues.</strong> Each participant drafted their own writing sample regarding the importance of clean streams and clean water.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture&rsquo;s workshop, led by myself and Director of Policy Ezra Thrush, focused on how to effectively conduct meetings with your elected officials about clean water issues.</strong> The one-hour session provided a detailed overview about how to set up a meeting with your legislator, including outreach to bring along fellow constituents, conducting the meeting, and following up after the meeting with the legislator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the workshops, we were fortunate enough to be joined by Rep. Keith Gillespie (R-York) and Rep. David Zimmerman (R-Lancaster). Each of the representatives gave an overview of why clean water is important to them, as well as what kinds of environmental legislation we can expect to see in the next legislative session. We were able to hold a full one-hour breakout session with each of the representatives, where the participants were able to utilize the skills they had learned during our workshops and discuss the clean water issues that are most important to them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meeting with your elected officials is one of the most important actions you can take as a citizen. It&rsquo;s a small way you can make a big difference in your community. Teresa Caruthers, who attended the workshop, recently began volunteering with the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments and expressed just how important it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We (Alliance) recognize that clean water is essential for population health, as well as the health of our ecosystems.&nbsp; The PennFuture &amp; Trout Unlimited workshop offered me a timely opportunity to learn more about the broad range of issues, along with strategies to communicate effectively with public officials and the press,&rdquo; Caruthers said.</p>

<p>We hope the attendees at the workshop will apply the skills they learned to take initiative and develop relationships with their legislators moving forward. As we begin a new legislative session in just a few short months in Harrisburg, now is the time to get out and begin meeting with your returning or new elected officials. Your voice matters.</p>

<p><strong>Remember - to make democracy work, we must be a nation of participants, not simply observers.&nbsp;</strong></p>

Our Pocono Waters Forum Educates Community on Clean Streams,11/7/2018,"<p>On Oct.&nbsp;30, <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.org/""><em><strong>Our Pocono Waters Campaign</strong></em></a> hosted a&nbsp;panel forum discussion at East Stroudsburg University&rsquo;s Innovation and Entrepreneur Center. Six panelists from across the Commonwealth came together to educate the public about Exceptional Value (EV) and High Quality (HQ) stream classifications, and why they are important to the Poconos region. More than 110 members of the Pocono Mountains and Lehigh Valley communities attended the forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The program consisted of opening remarks from PennFuture&rsquo;s President and&nbsp;CEO Jacquelyn Bonomo, with closing remarks from Trout Unlimited&rsquo;s Mid Atlantic Organizer&nbsp;Rob Shane.</p>

<p>The rest of the night involved&nbsp;two separate panel discussions. The first panel was moderated by Abigail Jones, PennFuture&rsquo;s Staff Attorney. Jones asked panelists many questions pertaining to regulatory items relating to stream designations. The panel was privileged to have Robert Weber of the PA Fish and&nbsp;Boat Commission&rsquo;s unassessed waters program, Paul Wilson, Ph.D, a professor from ESU, and Chuck Gould from Chestnuthill Township, Monroe County, all talking about this important topic. This panel covered everything from macroinvertebrates to township regulations and developments that were not affected by stream upgrades, to programs in place in PA to assess every moving water body in order to enhance and protect the waters of the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second panel focused on users of exceptionally clean streams. Faith Zerbe of Delaware Riverkeeper Network played the role of moderator for this panel. Fred Gender, a local angler &amp; property owner; Gary Leander, a local canoeist; and Gary Bloss, a local business owner of Josie Porter Farms, discussed their experiences recreating on and owning businesses that rely on the Poconos&rsquo; exceptional value and high quality streams, along with their positive interactions with tourists who come to the Poconos for its beauty, fresh air, and elite fishing and boating waters. Fred and Gary had very similar experiences living in the acid mine drainage affected areas of PA and full heartedly expressed how thankful they are for the privilege to come to the Poconos to utilize the pristine fishable and swimmable rivers and streams that flow to the Delaware River.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the attendees funneled out of the door of the Innovation Center, many different conversations were arising and continuing.</p>

<p>The conversation about EV stream designations will continue between Our Pocono Waters Campaign and the citizens of the Pocono Region to educate about the importance of these protected waters and how showing support for protecting them will increase their value to the region, while still supporting responsible development and economic growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Our Pocono Waters Campaign is unifying the community while educating citizens, business leaders, and local leaders about the importance of protecting &ldquo;Exceptional Value&rdquo; (EV) streams, highlighting the many ways in which clean streams and economic development coexist in a region known for its natural beauty and booming tourism industry. Clean streams are at the heart of the Poconos, where 80 percent of the state&rsquo;s EV streams are located, primarily in Monroe, Pike, and Wayne counties.

Legislative Session Closes with Significant Environmental Fight,10/26/2018,"<div>With the close of legislative session in Harrisburg last week came significant victories for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental protection, as two harmful bills were halted thanks to our work in the Capital, and thanks to the many citizens who took action by contacting their elected officials.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Senate Bill 652, which aimed to silence those protesting pipelines, and House Bill 2154, which sought to roll back protections and regulations for the conventional oil and gas drilling industry, have both officially been defeated for this legislative session.&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This would not have been possible without the advocacy and hard work from PennFuture staff, members, supporters, and partners across the environmental community in Pennsylvania. Through action alert emails that engaged citizens with their elected officials, in-district constituent meetings with members of the General Assembly, calls to offices, sign-on letters with partner organizations and coalitions, and multiple lobby days, our presence and direct opposition to these bills truly had an impact.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>HB 2154 would have greatly compromised air and water quality, repealing conventional oil and gas drilling regulations for almost 35 years by reenacting the Oil and Gas act of 1984. </strong>This bill would have placed profits of the oil and gas industries above protections of public resources and public health. HB 2154 sought to promote the use of drilling fluids and wastewater without any supporting scientific evidence deeming it safe for the public, potentially leaving families at risk. This bill also would have broadly threatened surface water in rural areas, where many of the highest quality streams and headwaters are in Pennsylvania. Additionally, HB 2154 would have opened the door to more drilling operations across Pennsylvania, which would further endanger our air and water, and it called for eliminating protections for public resources, such as parks, forests and wildlife preserves, weakening public health regulations in favor of profits for polluters.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>HB 2154 saw some unexpected movement in the State Senate last week as the session clock counted-down, but PennFuture and our allies were vigilant, reaching across sector and policy areas, to build a wide coalition of groups to garner 26 &lsquo;NO&rsquo; votes on the bill. </strong>Because of this work, PennFuture and our partners were able to block this bill from being brought up for a final floor vote in the Senate before the Chamber gaveled out for recess, beating the industry&rsquo;s efforts. We may see this bill reappear in the next legislative session beginning in January, and we are prepared to fight it again.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Another dangerous bill that PennFuture spent much of its time fighting in the last weeks of session was Senate Bill 652. This bill&rsquo;s language was almost taken verbatim from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), funded largely by the oil and gas industry and polluters.</strong> It was a threat to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s democracy and public participation, and SB 652 aimed to inhibit protesting rights by imposing a felony offense upon any individual who enters a &lsquo;critical infrastructure&rsquo; facility with intent to &lsquo;impede&rsquo; operations. This means a person who attended a meeting during which a peaceful protest was planned against construction of an oil and gas facility could also be prosecuted for committing a felony - the same grade of offense used to define capital murder.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Senate Bill 652, cunningly known as the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, was part of a coordinated, nationwide campaign by the oil and gas industry to shield itself from any accountability for the pipelines, drilling rigs, and other projects they&rsquo;re putting on Pennsylvanians&rsquo; farms, backyards, schools, or close to our communities.</strong> The goal of SB 652 was to frighten Pennsylvanians away from opposing oil and gas projects, even if those projects harm our health, land, or families. SB 652 was an attack on the rights of Pennsylvanians to stand up for their clean air and clean water, and an attempt to silence people who oppose environmental degradation, the potential consequences of natural gas infrastructure, and the reckless behavior of the oil and gas industry.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PennFuture worked closely with our environmental champions in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to speak against the bill in Committee and worked to build a group of votes against the it. After being bogged down with nearly 35 amendments, and because of its ferocious and controversial nature, it became evident in the last week that Senate Bill 652 would not be seeing a final vote on the floor of the House before the end of session. We count this as a victory and will continue to fight it if the bill returns in some other iteration in the next legislative session.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>With the end of legislative session, PennFuture and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment saw another victory with the defeat of the &ldquo;Regulatory Review&rdquo; package of bills, which included House Bills 209, 1237, 1792, 1959, and 1960, which sought to roll back key protections for our clean air and water, and sought to undermine our regulatory agencies, including the Department of Environmental Protection. </strong>Though these bills passed the House in May, PennFuture and our partners were able to stop them in four different Senate committees.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PennFuture also worked hard to advance and pass several beneficial bills during the 2017-2018 session, including House Bill 2468, which increases protections against abuse of eminent domain on plots of land with conservation easement status, such as the Stoneleigh Natural Garden in Villanova and the McCormick Farm in Cumberland County; thereby protecting our parklands and open spaces.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We also worked to pass House Bill 234, which establishes Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Commercial PACE program, authorizing local governments to create energy improvement districts to help fund energy efficiency, renewable energy and water conservation projects. We worked to pass House Bill 118, which closed the &lsquo;solar borders&rsquo; in Pennsylvania by requiring solar projects funded by solar credits from the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) to be built in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Several beneficial bills for environmental protection and conservation have failed to pass this session, but we will continue to advocate for them next year alongside partners. Here&rsquo;s what to look for in the coming months in terms of the work ahead:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>The passing of framework and funding legislation for a Growing Greener III program would be a huge step in the right direction for best management practice implementation and increasing funding for clean water across the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We will also continue to support legislation like Senate Bill 800, which aimed to revamp the statewide electronics recycling program in favor of a new, more functional program.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>PennFuture and clean water partners will also continue to work with the state legislature to pass a healthy and responsible fertilizer reduction and application bill such as Senator Alloway&rsquo;s Senate Bill 792, which called for the regulation of lawn fertilizer application; its passing would be significant for water quality, especially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>PennFuture will also work to pass legislation like House Bill 1446, aiming to increase electric vehicle-friendly infrastructure in the Commonwealth, Senate Bill 1236 proposing to update Act 129, an important utility energy conservation program, and Senate Bill 15, which sought to ensure that Pennsylvania continues to fulfill its responsibility in fighting global climate change, striving to meet its commitments under the Paris climate accord and attain the goals set forth in the Clean Power Plan.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In terms of renewable energy, PennFuture, in the next session, will advocate for community solar legislation like that of House Bill 2681, and a renewal of the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) legislation.</li>
</ul>

<div>For now, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and State Senate will return to Harrisburg after the elections on Nov.&nbsp;13&nbsp;and 14&nbsp;for the start of new member orientation, leadership elections, and caucus reorganization, but are not expected to move any legislation for the rest of this year. The General Assembly will likely be back during the first full week of January 2019 and we will continue to advocate for a clean and responsible state budget, track and advance legislation that protects our environment, acts on climate, and we will defend against any attacks on our Commonwealth&rsquo;s crucial clean air, water, and natural resource protections.</div>

PennFuture Celebrates Legal Victory for Exceptional Value Streams,10/23/2018,"<p>Some of the cleanest water in Pennsylvania flows from&nbsp;the Poconos &ndash; the headwater streams of our majestic Delaware River.&nbsp; <strong>PennFuture, representing itself and Brodhead Watershed Association, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-and-Brodhead-Watershed-Association-Earn-Legal-Victory-for-Exceptional-Value-Streams-in-the-Poconos"">won a significant legal victory earlier this month</a> when the Environmental Hearing Board (EHB) dismissed a challenge to the classification of four of those headwater streams as Exceptional Value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Adding to a long list of legal wins over PennFuture&rsquo;s 20 year history, this decision by the EHB held back an attack by a group of resorts and developers who challenged the process by which the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection classifies waters for protection. In this instance, the four streams under scrutiny &ndash; Swiftwater Creek, Paradise Creek, Tunkhannock Creek and Devil&rsquo;s Hole &ndash; will receive the highest level of protection from degradation through the Exceptional Value classification. And that&rsquo;s a really good thing, because there is a very long list of communities, livelihoods, economies and critters who benefit from this cleanest of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The group who brought this legal action against DEP -- in which PennFuture and Brodhead Watershed Association intervened -- includes the largest resorts in the Poconos. The resorts have plans to build, grow, and become even larger. And while they say they are environmentalists, we see that they aren&rsquo;t green enough to develop in a way that respects the purity of Pocono water, the integrity of its forested landscape, unique natural beauty, or the history of the area as a mecca for quiet respite in the outdoors for over a century. These businesses find environmental rules too tough and costly to comply with, and to make it all a little easier, question the state&rsquo;s scientists, and ask the courts to make it easier for them to develop by allowing some pollution to the streams that stand in their way. We expect that these resorts will continue to try to undermine clean streams protections, and PennFuture will be here to fight back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March 2017, PennFuture moved its northeast office to Mount Pocono. We became part of the community and were welcomed by the rich array of water advocates, land protectors, and recreationists who for decades stewarded these lands and waters. This move proved to be fortuitous and put PennFuture in one of the most important disputes around clean water in a long time. PennFuture&rsquo;s lawyers had represented several of these groups and their interests in the past, resulting in strong relationships that were already in place. The organization was able to quickly mobilize to defend the exceptional water of the Poconos.&nbsp;<strong>The stakes for the future of the Poconos are high, and the work to protect the region by necessity involves more than litigation.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>As a complement to our legal work, we are part of the very exciting <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.org/""><u><strong>Our Pocono Waters Campaign</strong></u></a>, launched earlier this fall with key partners including Trout Unlimited, Delaware Riverkeeper Network and many more stewards of the Poconos environment, including a growing list of businesses and civic organizations.&nbsp; <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.org/our-pocono-waters-partners/""><u><strong>These groups and businesses</strong></u></a> are advancing a sustainable vision for growth in the Poconos, in an endeavor to keep the natural assets and character of the region that make is so special.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
This fight for clean water in the Poconos includes a display of grassroots support, so that elected officials in each of Monroe County&rsquo;s 17 municipalities &ndash; as well as the greater Pocono region &ndash; understand there is broad support for true environmental protection and sustainable growth.&nbsp;<strong>That show of force is building through an online petition that to-date has over 2,200 signatures and <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/protectourpoconowaters/index.html""><u>we hope you will sign and be part of this important fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></a></strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/103018cleanstreamsthepoconosandyouforum/index.html""><strong>On Tuesday, Oct. 30 from 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Our Pocono Waters Campaign is presenting a forum entitled &ldquo;Clean Streams, the Poconos, and You&rdquo; at East Stroudsburg University.</strong></a>&nbsp;The evening is an opportunity for you to learn more from expert panelists, including understanding the regulatory protection of water in Pennsylvania, and hearing from businesses and recreationists that rely on clean water.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s all stay informed and educated on these issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, we will not win this fight without money.&nbsp;PennFuture is raising funds for our legal defense of Exceptional Value waters in the Poconos to continue to fight on the legal front.&nbsp;The battle for the Poconos&rsquo; clean water is not over, and we are also preparing for similar fights in other parts of the state.&nbsp;<strong>Our fund goal is $25,000 <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018OPWCampaign/index.html"">and if you can make a contribution</a>, you can help keep us in the fight.</strong>&nbsp;This&nbsp; campaign for clean water will take legal muscle, broad support from grassroots, businesses and civic-minded organizations, well-informed citizens and advocates and sufficient financial resources.&nbsp;<strong>Let&rsquo;s work together to be prepared for a long fight.&nbsp;</strong></p>

"With New Climate Report Issued, PennFuture Continues Legacy of Work",10/12/2018,"<p>I&rsquo;ve waited five days to write something about the October 8 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) document, <a href=""http://sdg.iisd.org/news/ipcc-special-report-limiting-global-warming-to-1-5c-will-require-unprecedented-transitions/""><strong>The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&ordm;C</strong></a>. This time around, the panel uses its powerful voice and platform to pronounce that we are living through the impacts of 1 degree change. This time, the IPCC makes its case that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is the best pathway to avoid the irreversible impacts of climate change. The panel makes no bones that to get there will be extremely challenging, and that no sector of society can sit out doing its part to greatly limit its carbon footprint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By now, millions will have said something about the report on social media, or to their friends and family. I can&rsquo;t offer anything original or that hasn&rsquo;t been said many, many times since last Saturday. So, I find myself asking how, if, the report changes the world for PennFuture? If I am going to be honest with my answer, it doesn&rsquo;t. <strong>We operate from the same pronounced, crucial and excruciating imperative to act on climate this week, as we did when we formed as an organization 20 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>By the time PennFuture was founded in October 1998, Dr. James Hansen&rsquo;s testimony to Congress on global warming was ten years old. The NASA climate scientist noted the warmth of the earth at that time was the hottest ever, and that there was enough data for him to say that extreme weather was attributable to impacts from the greenhouse gas effect. In 1990, the IPCC issued its first assessment, this time the science and the call to act wasn&rsquo;t a single voice speaking from within NASA, it was a large body of scientists presenting more data and recommendations for policy makers upon which the United Nations was then to act through the UN Framework on Climate Change. The Framework was ratified at the Earth Summit in Rio in &lsquo;92, taken up again in Kyoto, further shaped in Bali, Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban until finally the United States, China, India and the entirety of the world embraced a chance through the Paris Climate Accord in 2015.</p>

<p>Here in Pennsylvania, PennFuture was making progress, a little at a time, helping the state set goals for renewables, helping consumers make good energy choices, helping nascent alternative energy businesses get their legs under them and connect to a growing network through the early days of our Energy Center. We began dealing with the onslaught of gas, working for guidelines and protections for communities&hellip;always with ambitions to do more, to provide leadership at a scale that meets the imperative, to act in ways that meet the growing climate crisis described by 40 years of excruciating science, and now, with almost daily evidence of the changing world around us &ndash; everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, here at PennFuture, we are settled into the work we have to do. We&rsquo;re doing some planning, and we are hoping it will be informed by outcomes of November 6, Election Day. We hope you will vote, and vote with the environment and our climate in mind. We hope Election Day will bring change and send enough of a message to give elected officials who in their hearts know the time has come to act, the will to step up and with your help, and the help or organizations like PennFuture, finally make Pennsylvania a climate leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Lancaster County’s Road to Water Restoration,10/10/2018,"<div>Back in April when I first began my journey at PennFuture, I published the blog <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Building-a-Community-Clean-Water-Toolbox-How-PA-Will-Meet-its-Goals""><em>Building a Community Clean Water Toolbox: How PA Will Meet its Goals</em></a>. During the time, Pennsylvania had just launched its pilot program in Franklin, Adams, York, and Lancaster counties to meet its Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency. Since this time, significant progress has been made by each of these counties in the development of action plans to reduce pollution runoff going into our local waterways.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Franklin and Adams counties have been meeting with the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s (DEP) Chesapeake Bay office to develop their toolboxes; York County has been hosting bi-weekly meetings to develop their pollution diet plan, with only a few meetings left until they release their plan to the public. Lancaster County Clean Water Partners have been convening every two weeks in the development of their toolbox, and officially released their draft strategy for restoring local water quality on Wednesday, Oct. 3.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The draft plan, developed by the Partners, focuses on cleaning up local waters in Lancaster County, where 21 percent of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s pollution reduction goals need to occur. It is a tall task, as 1,400 miles of streams in the county, or 50 percent, are considered &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; by the EPA. This means that the bodies of water are considered too polluted or otherwise degraded to meet the water quality standards set by the states, territories or authorized tribes in the U.S. under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. Coupled with this is the troubling fact that 80 percent of the pollution reduction goals need to come from the agriculture sector alone. In total, Lancaster County must reduce 11 million pounds of pollution (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment) loading into the Chesapeake Bay by 2025.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Who Led These Efforts?</strong></div>

<div>The Clean Water Partners writing team, led by Justin Evans, Allyson Gibson, Brian Gish, Ruth Hocker, Mark Huber, Peter Hughes, Matt Kofroth, Joe Sweeney, Chris Thompson, Joellyn Warren , and many others, met every two weeks to develop the draft plans that were presented at the meeting. Over the last several months, the Partners have conducted municipal roundtables, orchestrated engineer luncheons, hosted conference calls with the Agricultural Council, and met with the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program. Their primary objective was to act as an &ldquo;information hub&rdquo; for all of the suggestions, and make sure that all of the information necessary to develop the draft, and solicit input from stakeholders, was centralized.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>What Does the Draft Strategy Look Like?</strong></div>

<div>The draft plan focuses on six key areas that need to be addressed in order to meet compliance with the TMDL. These areas include data management, agriculture, stormwater, buffers, stream restoration, and land use and preservation.&nbsp;</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Data Management: </strong>Areas of improvement include a central location for conservation plans, restoration project permits, and grant applications. It also emphasizes the importance of improved documentation of current practices, more in-stream water quality monitoring to establish baselines, and identifying the best tools needed to achieve the goals and to measure progress and success.</li>
	<li><strong>Agriculture: </strong>In order to come to compliance and meet the 80 percent reduction goals necessary in the agriculture sector, the writing team laid out several important areas to focus on. This includes implementing better manure management practices, with a goal of reducing 25 percent of the annual application. In order to do this, they suggested introducing an end to winter spreading, and identifying and promoting the best location-specific alternate practices to deal with manure. Along with this, the team also highlighted the importance of acknowledging the need for a five to eight year phase-in period and to provide support. Other areas of improvement include building new manure storages and implementing barnyard management in priority areas, establishing a recording system of manure transport in and out of the county, increasing the number of farms who do livestock stream access management by 50 percent, increasing cover crops by 40 percent, increasing no-till and/or conservation tillage, and increasing buffer and stream restoration.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Stormwater: </strong>In order to meet compliance in stormwater pollution reduction, the Partners suggested several scenarios. Identifying alternative sources of project possibilities that receive credit above compliance, developing and encouraging adoption of local land use ordinances to address stormwater more efficiently, and implementing innovative water quality projects that are effective and cost-efficient are all possibilities.</li>
	<li><strong>Buffers:</strong> In the blog I highlighted in the opening paragraph, I illustrated the importance of buffers on water quality. The Partners recognize the cost-efficient values that buffers provide, and suggest including an exemplary buffer demonstration of one to two acres in every township, creating an online map of buffer implementation to show progress, and direct landowner outreach for implementation to show progress. In conjunction with this, Lancaster County also aims to create a buffer program to complement CREP, and create and coordinate outreach campaigns for all public lands and semi-public lands to be required to install buffers.</li>
	<li><strong>Stream Restoration:</strong> The Partners outlined 50 projects plus basic, cost-effective monitoring of before and after water quality results that are shared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Land Use &amp; Preservation: </strong>Finally, the Partners suggested implementing county planning initiatives, better growth management practices, improved planning and design, increased natural resources, open spaces and parks, and increasing tree canopy in both rural and urban areas.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Where Does This Draft Succeed?</strong></div>

<div>The draft plan written by the Partners highlights some of the key areas that have been severely lacking in the last 8 years of the Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). Through the first two phases of the WIP (2010-2017), there was a centralized, top-down approach to regulating the counties, which solicited less input from key stakeholders and limited their ability to contribute to the development of the projects. That all changed with the Phase III WIP &ndash; as it stresses the importance stakeholder engagement and has allowed the counties to develop their own toolboxes based on the geography, urban and rural makeup, and technical assistance necessary to reach their pollution reduction goals. Lancaster&rsquo;s draft strategy for restoring their local water quality emphasizes a comprehensive, grassroots, and integrated approach to reducing water pollution by bringing together a diverse set of voices with a myriad of technical expertise.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Where Do We Go from Here?</strong></div>

<div>It must be noted that these strategies are only a draft of the final product, and the final version will undoubtedly go into much greater detail of how to specifically reduce pollution based on each sector. For the last half of the meeting, the Partners solicited input in the form of roundtable discussions from the nearly 100 participants who attended. They will take the feedback they have received, continue to work on and revise the plan, and present it to the Chesapeake Bay Office in early November.&nbsp;</div>

<div>There is still work to be done before the draft will be finalized &ndash; but, we&rsquo;re in the end game now.&nbsp;</div>

A Successful Forum to Celebrate the Delaware River Watershed,10/9/2018,"<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/CDRW%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 547px; height: 492px;"" /></p>

<p>The Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed (CDRW) celebrated its sixth annual Delaware River Watershed Forum in Cape May, NJ on September 25 and 26. As attendees walked through the doors of the conference center at the Grand Hotel, there was an aura of victory amongst them. In the last year, this same group of people have celebrated wins and advanced new priority goals while swimming through a very challenging political climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March 2018, for the first time in history, the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program (DRBRP) received $5 million in funding as part of the Fiscal Year 2018 Omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed by the President. Because of this, dedicated funds will now go to on-the-ground projects designed to conserve and restore wildlife and fish habitats, improve water quality, and increase public access to the Delaware River and its tributaries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The forum hosted a plethora of opportunities for attendees to network, learn about new programs, and educate their colleagues about work presently going on in the basin. They heard welcome remarks from CDRW&rsquo;s new director, Sandra Meola, along with words from Eric Stiles, President and CEO of New Jersey Audubon, who promoted the goal of every stream in the Delaware Basin becoming &ldquo;fishable and swimmable&rdquo; for generations to come. For the next two days, there were so many different discussions and presentations to choose from to attend. Members had their choice of the Wild and Scenic Rivers program to Agricultural Best Management Practices to advocacy efforts to municipal engagement techniques. Any topic there may have been an interest in could have been found at this forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s President and CEO Jacquelyn Bonomo welcomed everyone to the banquet dinner and reinforced the importance of partnering on projects to be successful. It was exhilarating to see everyone take out their cell phones and sign <a href=""http://www.ourpoconowaters.org""><strong>Our Pocono Waters Campaign petition</strong></a>, stating why exceptional value streams are important to them before they sat down to share a meal with colleagues and friends. After dinner, the networking continued over ice cold local craft brews in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/4-The-Delaware-1510522942349896/""><strong>4theDelaware Campaign</strong></a> pint glasses and live music. Some of the networking even shifted to the beach as attendees gazed at the harvest moon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To wrap up the forum, the group had the privilege of listening to the stories and checking out some amazing river pictures by Tim Palmer, an author and photographer focusing on rivers, conservation, and the environment. As everyone said their good-bye-for-now&rsquo;s at the end of the last session, the positive thinking and eagerness to get back to their computer desks, sampling equipment, and conference calls to further the mission and priorities of CDRW could not be overlooked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The coalition&rsquo;s seventh year will hold new obstacles, successes, and opportunities for all members of the coalition, but with teamwork and common goals, this group will see success once again when they meet for the 7th Annual Delaware River Watershed Forum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As the Pennsylvania state lead for the CDRW, PennFuture is dedicated to mobilizing the priorities of the coalition through watershed outreach, policy monitoring, and basin wide partnerships.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mission of the Coalition is to unite organizations and enhance their capacity to effectively advocate for protecting and restoring the Delaware River Basin by coordinating communications, messages, and actions and fostering accountability for success at the federal, state, and local levels.&rdquo; &ndash; CDRW mission statement.

"Artists Interpreting Climate Change, Part II",10/1/2018,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">A few weeks ago, <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-How-Artists-Interpret-Climate-Change-Raise-Awareness"">I wrote a blog&nbsp;about how artists are interpreting climate change,</a> and what some artists are doing to prevent it. Since then, I&rsquo;ve heard from a number of people about other creative projects dealing with these issues. I quickly realized that I needed to write a sequel blog on the subject.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Not all artists use paint and canvas to pay attention to climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">One of the most amazing uses of creative technology, which many of us recently saw, was when <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRkXPuGAHkE"">The Weather Channel used augmented reality graphics</a>&nbsp;to demonstrate the possible effects of Hurricane Florence&rsquo;s storm surge. Meteorologists were surrounded on screen by the rising water, carrying floating cars and other debris, while they explained the potential danger of the surge. The Weather Channel is partnering with The Future Group to take an &ldquo;Unreal Engine&rdquo; (originally created for video games) and use it as &ldquo;immersive mixed-reality technology&rdquo; to improve their viewers&rsquo; understanding of weather phenomena. Michael Potts, TWC&rsquo;s vice president of design, said that this technology, which wasn&rsquo;t even available a few months ago, &ldquo;allows us to paint pictures&rdquo; unlike anything anyone has ever seen. These are high-tech artists at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">A musician who is paying attention to climate change is GZA, one of the founding members of the hip-hop group, Wu-Tang Clan. GZA isn&rsquo;t rapping about the climate. He&rsquo;s exploring it in his TV series, &ldquo;Liquid Science.&rdquo; The first episode is titled Global Warming, and is available on Netflix <a href=""https://www.redbull.com/int-en/tv/video/AP-1N7M59QHW2111/global-warming?playlist=AP-1N83MJWAH2111:season:1"">or can be streamed here</a>.&nbsp;Other episodes of the series take GZA on a journey where he meets with scientists and engineers who are shaping the future. All of them are worth watching.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Closer to home, the environmental artist Stacy Levy has created an installation in the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia called Tide Field, through Nov. 20, which uses &ldquo;art as a vehicle for translating the patterns and processes of the natural world.&rdquo; The piece, commissioned by the Mural Arts Philadelphia and Bartram&rsquo;s Garden, consists of hundreds of multi-colored caterpillar-like buoys which move with the tidal flow. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q-soXXKN70&amp;w=840&amp;h=473"">There is a great video of the work here. </a>I first became aware of Levy&rsquo;s work when I visited the Frick Environmental Center in Pittsburgh this summer and saw her beautiful Rain Ravine, which funnels water from the rooftop down almost 300 feet across a sandstone sculpture to the wetlands below. <a href=""http://pghsolartour.org"">If you are planning to go on PennFuture&rsquo;s Solar Tour this Saturday</a>,&nbsp;you can view it then.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">An entire exhibit of works made with non-traditional materials is at the <a href=""https://www.brandywine.org/museum"">Brandywine River Museum of Art&nbsp;</a>through Oct. 21. Natural Wonders: The Sublime in Contemporary Art, features 13 American artists examining our relationship with nature. According the curator, Suzanne Ramljak, the works &ldquo;reflect the current anxiety and concern for the sustainability of the Earth&rsquo;s resources.&rdquo; The exhibit is meant to complement the work of the Brandywine Conservancy and its efforts to protect land and water in the Brandywine Valley.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">As cool as all of these uses of innovative materials, approaches, and technology are, the most exciting thing I&rsquo;ve seen since posting my first blog was that the <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/"">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>&nbsp;actually has a position on their staff for working with artists who pay attention to climate change!&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the really hard things about climate change is that people struggle to imagine it, and imagine what it looks like,&rdquo; says Elizabeth Corr, Manager of Arts Partnerships for the NRDC. &ldquo;Artists and art have the incredible ability to break down that barrier . . . that allows the public to interact, to ask questions, to have emotive responses, to feel. And once they&rsquo;re feeling, they&rsquo;ll be more inclined to take action.&rdquo; NRDC also has its own <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/stories/can-public-art-save-planet"">artists-in-residence program</a>&nbsp;to support this work. Wow!</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">While I continue to explore how artists are paying attention to climate change, I keep thinking back to one of the most interesting books I read in graduate school, <a href=""http://www.artandphysics.com/"">Leonard Shlain&rsquo;s Art &amp; Physics.</a> Shlain, a medical doctor, takes his reader on a historical tour of how people understand reality &ndash; through art and through science. Written in a way that is accessible to everyone, he makes the argument that art and science are parallel visions that have been informing each other throughout time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Seeing how artists are tackling issues of science in their work that comments on, and in some cases tries to prevent, climate change, is inspiring. As we work to save our planet for future generations, it is even more important to now recognize these parallel methods of understanding and changing, our world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I can&rsquo;t wait to see what we do next!</p>

The Inevitable Policy Response Theory,9/26/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Christina Simeone, Director of Policy and External Affairs at Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.</strong></em></p>

<p>As PennFuture recognizes climate month and the state of Pennsylvania enjoys its <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/clean-energy-week-2018/""><strong>newly minted clean energy week </strong></a>with a proclamation from Gov. Tom Wolf, a new thought provoking theory is introduced from the international financial community that I thought I&rsquo;d share.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The theory is called the <u><strong><a href=""http://www.unpri.org/"">Inevitable </a><a href=""http://www.unpri.org/"">Policy Response (IPR),</a></strong></u> and it predicts a rapid and forceful international policy reaction to climate change with widespread financial implications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The theory was introduced by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), which is an independent, institutional investor-driven proponent of <a href=""https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=1534""><strong>responsible investment</strong></a>, with signatories representing over $59 trillion in assets. PRI works internationally, in partnership with the UN Global Compact and UNEP Finance Initiative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PRI issued a series of policy and technical papers on the IPR to inform institutional investors about the IPR risks, and to help prepare them to navigate pending market turbulence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s breakdown the IPR theory.</p>

<p><strong>The Policy Ambition Gap. </strong>The logic from the folks at PRI starts with recognizing there is a &ldquo;policy ambition gap&rdquo; in the Paris Agreement serving as an uncertainty in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. This is the white space between the national pledges (i.e. the nationally determined contributions) and the 2&deg;C pathway in dark blue.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/christinablog%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 452px; height: 245px;"" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What is IPR?</strong> IPR is the missing, but required, policy action to move the world towards a target of 1.5&deg;C to 1.75&deg;C with 50 &ndash; 66% probability (i.e. closing the Policy Ambition Gap). The longer there is a delay in emissions reduction policy implementation now, the greater the need for more rapid, forceful, and disruptive policy action in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PRI is concerned about the IPR, because they believe companies and investors will essentially be price-takers during a period of immense volatility. This volatility is expected to occur after announcement of the IPR, as the markets adjust to expected policy-driven actions.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this Inevitable? </strong>PRI contends several factors will coalesce to <a href=""https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5378""><strong>trigger </strong></a>the IPR. As the physical (e.g. extreme weather) and economic (e.g. insurance industry) impacts of climate change become more visible, attitudes will change and place social pressure on policymakers. Security issues related to climate impacts&mdash;from migration to regional destabilization&mdash;will increase. Investors will push to reduce regulatory uncertainty and risk on greenhouse gases to inform long-term investments, and the cost-competitiveness of low-carbon technologies will continue to improve.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>When, What, and How?</strong> After examining the forthcoming schedule of post-Paris national pledges, <a href=""https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5368""><strong>PRI concludes the IPR will occur by 2025</strong></a> (around the time of the &ldquo;Global Stocktake&rdquo;). The IPR could consist of coordinated global action, or could be comprised by enhanced commitments from leadership nations, states, and economies. PRI doesn&rsquo;t specify the substance of the IPR, but believes it would likely consist of demand-side (e.g. carbon pricing at $54 &ndash; $190/tonne CO2e) and supply-side (e.g. eliminate fossil fuel subsidies) policies, as well as promotion of negative emissions strategies (e.g. sequestration).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Impact on Institutional Investors. </strong>PRI states that as soon as the IPR is announced, it would immediately change how investors value assets and would trigger a period of high volatility until policy and implementation details are determined and analyzed. In general terms, PRI indicates the IPR would rapidly shift capital from high- to low-carbon activities and could result in stranded assets and losses.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations.</strong> PRI believes institutional investors should engage in forward looking scenario and strategic planning to better prepare for transition and mitigate financial losses associated with the IPR. They believe careful attention should be paid to strategic asset allocation, portfolio structure, governance approaches, and risk management responses. Specifically, PRI outlines a framework for integrating IPR transition into <a href=""https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5379""><strong>strategic asset allocation and portfolio construction</strong></a> that investors can use to prepare for the high volatility period that will ensue once the IPR is announced. In addition, PRI prepared a <a href=""https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5380""><strong>list of investor actions in each phase of the IPR</strong></a> (i.e. pre-policy announcement, post-policy announcement, and during implementation).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is at Stake? <a href=""https://www.eiuperspectives.economist.com/sites/default/files/The%20cost%20of%20inaction_0.pdf"">As stated in a terrific report from The Economist,</a></strong> &ldquo;Regulation has largely failed to confront the risks associated with climate change borne by long-term institutional investors.&rdquo; The report calculated the present value of manageable assets at risk from unchecked climate change, with mean loss to the private sector estimated at $4.2 trillion and mean losses from the societal perspective rising to $13.9 trillion.&nbsp; However, limiting warming to within 2&deg;C (i.e. closing the policy gap) reduces these risk by 50 &ndash; 57%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may or may not believe in the IPR theory, but you should appreciate what it represents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A large international network of long-money (i.e. pension funds, endowments, insurance) not only advocating for, but foreshadowing and framing out preparations for a near-term, large-scale shift towards a low-carbon global economy.</p>

Hurricane Florence is the Latest Sign of Our Failure + Enduring Hope,9/26/2018,"<p>Hurricane Florence was a feat of human engineering. It turned into a ferocious killer in a matter of days because we&rsquo;ve warmed the oceans, providing the storm with excessive moisture to supercharge its strength. It brought historic flooding because we&rsquo;ve also warmed the atmosphere, transforming the character of the jet stream and re-writing weather patterns that lead to slow, meandering storms that swell our streams and rivers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hurricane Florence follows in the footsteps of Harvey, Sandy, Maria, Matthew, Wilma, Irma, and Katrina, a series of critical, devastating and deadly events, all proving we&rsquo;ve lost our best chance to stop climate change. At the same time, we should remain hopeful that progress toward reducing fossil fuel climate change is nearing an inflection point and while we must now live with a changing climate, we can limit its savagery.</p>

<p>Since NASA scientist James Hansen testified before Congress in 1988 that burning fossil fuels was altering the climate, countless individuals around the world have courageously sought decisive action to stop potentially dangerous changes to our weather and way of life. For 30 years, efforts have been made at all levels of society, the economy, and government to charter a path away from climate catastrophe by building a new, low carbon energy system.</p>

<p>Yet, it&rsquo;s clear we&rsquo;re past the point where we can stop human-made activities from changing the weather, a fact <a href=""https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/8/28/16213268/harvey-climate-change"">North Carolinians </a>won&rsquo;t soon forget. Rather, the goal post has moved as we try to stop locking in increasingly dangerous climate changes for decades and centuries to come. We are also forced to prepare our infrastructure and our communities for the human-charged weather events we have already put into the hopper because of our lack of action.</p>

<p>According to scientists <a href=""http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1934/20"">Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows</a>, industrial nations must peak their carbon emissions by 2020 and cut emissions by 10 percent each year thereafter until we hit zero to avoid a 2 degrees Celsius rise in global temperatures. Doing so is our best chance at avoiding a severe, long-term climate crisis we would not be able to reverse. Over half of our carbon pollution stays in the atmosphere for centuries (unless we invent an effective way to capture it), meaning we&rsquo;ve already dumped so much into it that the only way to stop it is dropping to net-zero as quickly as possible. But, global carbon levels have increased every year since 1988 and show no signs of waning, let alone falling at the deep rates we&rsquo;ll need in a few short years.</p>

<p>Our attempts at changing public policy to reverse this onerous trend have been equally grim. The first attempt at cutting carbon&mdash;the Kyoto Protocol&mdash;failed because industrial countries, like the United States, chose not to ratify the treaty. The latest global treaty attempt&mdash;the Paris Accord&mdash;was dashed by the ascent of climate-denying President Trump. Oil, natural gas, and coal still receive <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/aug/07/fossil-fuel-subsidies-are-a-staggering-5-tn-per-year"">$5 trillion (with a T!) </a>in government-sponsored subsidies every year, including more than <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidy-Report"">$3 billion per year from Pennsylvania, far more than those supporting renewable energy.</a></p>

<p>While carbon <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=34872"">emissions have decreased 13%</a> in the United States since 2005 (and 16% in Pennsylvania) because of renewable energy deployment, expanding use of natural gas, and coal plant closures, the long-term picture is still dismal. <a href=""https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-environ-110615-085934?journalCode=energy"">By choice, the U.S. is locking</a> in decades of gas plants and pipelines that ensure we will continue emitting carbon from power plants, spewing methane from infrastructure, and perpetuating a political economy around fossil fuels aimed at continuing their operation, no matter how dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is a prime example of the problems we face trying to stop the root causes of climate change, as we build out dozens of natural gas power plants and <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/pipeline-building-boom/"">4,600 miles of gas pipelines</a>, while providing the <a href=""https://triblive.com/business/headlines/10595729-74/tax-shell-pennsylvania"">red carpet treatment</a> to plastics manufacturers to use the Commonwealth&rsquo;s fracked gas well into the century. Pennsylvania leaders are trying to have it both ways by supporting climate-rotting natural gas at every turn, while occasionally offering weak climate and clean energy policies to goose up voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thirty years since Hansen&rsquo;s clarion call, it&rsquo;s clear that we have failed to stop climate change, but that&rsquo;s not stopping us from ensuring its stay is short. Thousands of governments and corporations, including <a href=""https://www.wearestillin.com/signatories?title=&amp;field_sector_target_id=All&amp;field_public_value=All&amp;field_address_administrative_area=PA&amp;field_location_proximity=25&amp;field_location_proximity-lat=&amp;field_location_proximity-lng=&amp;geolocation_geocoder_google_geocoding_api=&amp;geolocation_geocoder_google_geocoding_api_state=1"">97 entities in Pennsylvania</a>, have joined the We Are Still In movement to pledge continued support for climate action, even if our elected leaders at the highest levels won&rsquo;t. Global investments in clean energy <a href=""https://about.bnef.com/blog/clean-energy-10-predictions-2018/"">have now grown</a> to over $330 billion and renewable energy deployment is far outpacing new fossil fuel generation. <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2018/0427/Even-in-Trump-era-green-energy-innovation-is-sparking-not-sputtering"">New clean energy innovations</a> from our laboratories and universities, as well as those already in the market, are making zero-carbon energy cheaper and more accessible to consumers. The seeds of transformational change are sprouting.</p>

<p>And that is why I&rsquo;m hopeful in the face of overwhelming odds. If Hurricane Florence was manipulated by burning coal and oil for the last century, her future siblings will be born and raised on the backs of fracked natural gas. While I&rsquo;m confident that we will prepare ourselves for their brutal power, I&rsquo;m also optimistic we can buck our past and present failures to make the changes in Pennsylvania and elsewhere so that preparation isn&rsquo;t the only option. It&rsquo;s up to all of us to prioritize climate action in all of the choices we make, including how we vote.</p>

<p>The pieces are in place for significant and sudden climate success. It&rsquo;s not a matter of whether, it&rsquo;s a matter of when, and I&rsquo;m enduringly hopeful that an era of climate action in Pennsylvania and abroad isn&rsquo;t so far away.</p>

"House Bill 2154 Threatens PA Communities, Putting Polluters First",9/25/2018,"<p>We hear frequently about the need to control methane and other dangerous pollutants from natural gas extraction in the Marcellus shale, known as the &ldquo;unconventional&rdquo; gas industry. <strong>These large and deep wells hold the significant potential to release pollutants when things go wrong, but the less talked about &ldquo;conventional gas&rdquo; industry is just as central to the Commonwealth&rsquo;s pollution problems.</strong> Legislators&rsquo; efforts to pretend conventional wells are just the cleaner, smaller cousins of unconventional gas by rolling back environmental protections are dangerous to our communities and based on a false assessment of the industry.</p>

<p>There are over 7,000 large unconventional wells in Pennsylvania, but more than 70,000, smaller, and shallower conventional wells, along with more than 300,000 orphaned and abandoned wells from more than a century of conventional drilling.&nbsp;When it comes to potential pollution, these wells make up for in numbers what they lack in size.</p>

<p><strong>Because there are many more operators drilling many more wells, it can be challenging to regulate the conventional oil and gas industry, but this isn&rsquo;t a problem we can ignore simply because it is difficult to track.</strong>&nbsp;Some of these wells use hydraulic fracturing (fracking) just like their bigger cousins, and many of them are located near homes, schools, streams, parks, and other particularly sensitive areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In spite of this, there are forces in the state Legislature that are trying to roll back environmental protections related to these wells. If successful, their plans would put clean air and pure water in jeopardy. <strong><a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/hb2154copy1/index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=6f01befb-fb7e-4c37-8806-0979eb166d56""><u>House Bill 2154, which could be voted on this week in the State Senate,</u></a> essentially sets the requirements on these sources to the levels they were in 1984, rejecting modern advances in technology and instead, allowing these operators to use decades old techniques that pollute more.</strong></p>

<p>Regulating these sources is hard enough already, but House Bill 2154 would take away important tools the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection uses to protect communities. For example, this bill would require DEP to issue warnings in certain cases instead of notices of violation.&nbsp;That is basically telling operators that in many cases, they have a free pass for their first violation, which is potentially dangerous for citizens living in close proximity to these wells. Industry accountability should be prioritized.</p>

<p>This bill also eviscerates bonding requirements.&nbsp;Normally, the DEP requires operators to provide bonds that will fund the state to plug wells if an operator goes out of business or otherwise defaults on its obligations.&nbsp;If this bonding requirement isn&rsquo;t high enough to accomplish the task, we either add to the number of abandoned wells polluting our state or&nbsp; Pennsylvania taxpayers end up paying what the company should have. Instead of ensuring adequate bonding, this bill sets the cost of a bond at $2,500 per well, or a $25,000 &ldquo;blanket bond&rdquo; to cover the entirety of an operator&rsquo;s wells, no matter how many they have.&nbsp;That isn&rsquo;t nearly enough to properly close the wells, so the bill is essentially offering conventional drillers free insurance that Pennsylvania taxpayers would be forced to subsidize.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This bill not only takes power from the DEP, it also hurts land owners. <strong>Once a well is proposed, it gives DEP or the land owners just 15 days to raise objections.&nbsp;</strong>For land owners, that just isn&rsquo;t long enough to learn about a well, hire a qualified expert to review the proposal, then research and develop comments. Instead, this almost guarantees objections will be rushed and not fully developed. The DEP typically gives the public at least 30 days to comment on its actions and in complex cases routinely gives much longer. <strong>It&rsquo;s shocking that the legislature is willing to cut off the public&rsquo;s voice on such an important impact to their land, water, and community.</strong></p>

<p>HB 2154 also attempts to take the power away from municipalities to use their zoning authority to protect their citizens. The PA Supreme Court upheld this right in 2013, finding that the Environmental Rights Amendment of our state Constitution requires the government, including municipalities, to act as a trustee of the our natural resources.&nbsp; Removing this power means not just more pollution, but more pollution in our communities where we live, work, and learn, say nothing of being unconstitutional</p>

<p>While these reasons alone are enough to reject HB 2154, it&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; This bill is bad for all Pennsylvanians. It&rsquo;s shocking that after a century of grappling with the issues brought on by the fossil fuel industry, that elected officials in 2018 would be trying to give communities the tools from 1984 to defend and protect themselves Legislators should resoundingly reject this archaic bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Op-Ed: Beaver County Pipeline Explosion: How to Prevent Future Catastrophes,9/23/2018,"<p><a href=""http://www.timesonline.com/opinion/20180920/op-ed-beaver-county-pipeline-explosion-how-to-prevent-future-catastrophes""><em><strong>This blog post originally appeared as an opinion piece in the Sept. 20 edition of the Beaver County Times.</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Residents of Center Township, Beaver County, narrowly avoided a catastrophe on Sept. 10. A newly constructed natural gas pipeline ruptured, causing a terrifying explosion and fire that destroyed a house and several garages and vehicles.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s a great relief that no one was injured, we must still consider what we can do to prevent a similar occurrence, or worse, in the future.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to chalk the explosion up as an accident. The ruptured pipeline was caused by a landslide, an unintentional, chance occurrence. We can&rsquo;t prepare for that. Not true. If office towers can be built in cities prone to earthquakes, pipeline operators can prepare for landslides and minimize their impact.</p>

<p>In this instance, the pipeline owner, Energy Transfer Corporation, had installed the proper erosion and sedimentation controls, but they were not working at the time. That&rsquo;s what Jim Shaner, executive director of the Beaver County Conservation District, the agency responsible for inspecting ETC&rsquo;s pipeline construction procedures, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. So, lax safety practices by ETC, which also owns the problem-plagued Mariner East 2 pipeline, offset the safeguards in place, assuming those &ldquo;safeguards&rdquo; are enough.</p>

<p>But isn&rsquo;t a landslide an act of God? Not much we can do to prevent that. Again, not true. The landslide was caused by intense rains during the previous four days. Experts are attributing the heavy rains and flooding we&rsquo;ve been experiencing this summer to climate change &mdash; an act of man. Furthermore, climate science is signaling a much wetter future for our region, so land saturation and flooding from more frequent and more intense rainfall is coming.</p>

<p>No, this near-disaster cannot be dismissed as an accident or an act of God. The real culprit here is bad public policy and misguided economic development investments. For decades, policymakers of both parties have refused to allocate enough funding to the state agencies responsible for permitting and monitoring pipeline construction, and protecting our health and the environment. Furthermore, investing in gas, and not renewable and clean energy, is shortsighted, reckless and, as the Center Township explosion demonstrates, dangerous.</p>

<p>By failing to take the necessary steps to address climate change, legislators put our communities and climate at risk. Pursuing policies and investments that reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and begin to level the playing field between gas and renewables, such as wind and solar, would unequivocally prevent calamities like the one in Center Township.</p>

<p>The leading environmental organizations in Pennsylvania are fighting to improve current policies. The Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda, an action plan developed by a statewide coalition of more than 25 conservation and environmental groups, contains a number of practical policy solutions for bipartisan bolstering of the state&rsquo;s clean-energy sector, adequately funding the state agencies responsible for protecting the environment and natural resources, achieving environmental justice for the most-vulnerable communities, improving the quality of drinking water and more.</p>

<p>Achieving the policy changes called for here is going to require a groundswell of support from Pennsylvanians. With a pivotal election taking place Nov. 6, we need to take our demands for more enlightened, proactive environmental policies directly to the candidates running for governor and the Legislature. All of us must do our part. Visit <a href=""http://www.greenin18.org"">www.greenin18.org</a> to find out what you can do now to fight for a healthier environment in Pennsylvania.</p>

How Will Climate Change Affect Pennsylvania’s Plants and Animals?,9/20/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Greg Czarnecki, Climate Change and Research Coordinator, PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</strong></em></p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s climate is changing. Average temperatures have increased more than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit since the early 20th century, with even greater increases during the winter. Very heavy rain events and flooding are much more common, and while winters have become wetter, more precipitation is coming as rain and less as snow. These changes are beginning to alter habitats, change natural cycles, and impact the Commonwealth&rsquo;s plants and animals.</p>

<p>As the climate continues to change, plants and animals have three options &ndash; adapt, move, or die.</p>

<p>All living things have an optimal range of climatic conditions in which they can survive and thrive. Some, like white-tailed deer, which are found from Florida to northern Canada, have very broad tolerance ranges. They will just go with the flow and adapt to the changing conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those that have more narrow tolerance ranges and are mobile will need to move to areas with more favorable conditions, generally to the north or to higher elevations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This northward movement has occurred many times in our planet&rsquo;s history, most recently when the glaciers retreated during the last ice age. The difference now, however, is the speed with which the climate is changing and the lack of suitable habitat for migration and resettlement due to cities, roads, energy infrastructure, and urban sprawl.</p>

<p>One example of a Pennsylvania species on the move is the black-capped chickadee. This ubiquitous bird is no longer found in the southeast part of Pennsylvania, having been replaced by the Carolina chickadee, a southern species. Scientists have identified a hybridization zone where the ranges of the two birds overlap, which is moving north at about a kilometer per year.</p>

<p>You might not think of them as mobile, but plants can also shift their ranges in response to climate change. While they don&rsquo;t physically move, the geographic range within which their seeds germinate can. <a href=""http://www.docs.dcnr.pa.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_20033655.pdf""><u><strong>In its recently released climate change adaptation plan</strong></u></a>, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources evaluated the likelihood that the Commonwealth&rsquo;s most common trees will continue to flourish across their current range within the state. Among the species not likely to do well are American beech, Paper birch, and Quaking aspen. On the other hand, more southerly species not widely found here now, such as Sweet gum, Shortleaf pine, and American holly, are expected to expand their range within the state.</p>

<p>But not all species will be able to relocate as the climate changes, especially those with specific habitat requirements and a limited ability to move. One of the species that fits those criteria is North America&rsquo;s largest amphibian, the Eastern Hellbender.</p>

<p>The proposed state amphibian is found in medium to large cool water streams containing boulders, flat rocks, and healthy populations of their favorite food &ndash; crayfish. The Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program has conducted <a href=""http://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/CCVI.aspx""><u><strong>climate change vulnerability analyses</strong></u></a> for more than 100 Pennsylvania plants and animals, including the hellbender. They rank it as extremely vulnerable to climate change due to its habitat specificity, limited mobility, increasing water temperatures, limited genetic variation, pressure from amphibian collectors, and a likely significant decrease in suitable habitat by 2050.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are things we can do to reduce the impact of climate change on many of our species. For aquatic species like the hellbender, planting trees along riparian corridors, as is being done by <a href=""https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/Conservation/Water/RiparianBuffers/Pages/default.aspx""><u><strong>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s buffer initiative</strong></u></a>, can go a long way to cooling water temperatures and improving water quality. For species on the move, identifying and conserving critical migratory pathways will be necessary. And for those that can neither adapt or move, there is always the option of assisted migration. This translocation of a species into new areas of the state, however, should only be undertaken after a stringent scientific analysis of the implications of introducing a species to a new place on the landscape.</p>

"Recent Rollbacks Mean Dirtier Air, Increased Deaths from Pollution",9/18/2018,"<p>Since the Trump administration took over the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), it has talked a lot about its return to its &ldquo;core mission.&rdquo; It even has a whole section on its website devoted to the topic. But, after more than a year, it has become clearer than ever that actually protecting the environment isn&rsquo;t a priority. Instead, the number one mission appears to be its campaign to destroy any progress President Obama made in reducing air pollution and combating climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first salvo of this campaign targeted the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States, the transportation sector. On Aug. 2, the Trump administration released its proposal to roll back clean vehicle rules that the Obama administration negotiated with automakers. Worse still, this would also withdraw the California waiver so states like Pennsylvania would lose the ability to opt-in to more protective standards for their citizens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Trump plan, now called the &ldquo;Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles&rdquo; rule, is clearly a disaster for air quality. Since it does not advance the agency&rsquo;s old &ldquo;core mission&rdquo; of protecting the environment, the EPA has shifted its focus. Our new vehicles will chug out more smog-forming pollutants, cancer-causing particulates, and greenhouse gases, but the EPA claims (with little justification) that those new dirty vehicles will be safer and cheaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Trump EPA&rsquo;s recent attack on clean air is its proposal to repeal the Obama Administration&rsquo;s Clean Power Plan (CPP). If adopted, this new proposal will result in more than 1,400 additional fatalities from air pollution, increase the amount of missed school from students suffering from asthma and lost productivity from the parents who care for them, exacerbate global warming, and end up forcing consumers to pay more for dirtier, more polluting energy. In spite of that, the Trump administration decided to call it the &ldquo;Affordable Clean Energy&rdquo; rule (ACE).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CPP was built around section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), which requires existing power plants to use the &ldquo;best system of emissions reductions&rdquo; (BSER) that, after considering costs, health benefits, and energy requirements, has been adequately demonstrated. The Obama-era EPA did a comprehensive analysis and set state-by-state emissions standards that were presumptively BSER. It then tasked state governors to submit plans on how to meet those standards. Overall, this would result in an 870 million tons reduction in carbon pollution and have net benefits between $26 and $45 billion. In Pennsylvania, this would only take a modest step forward. We were about halfway to our target by the time the rule was proposed and had a number of cost-effective options to move forward.</p>

<p>The current ACE plan being proposed throws out the old rule, sacrificing $23 to $42 billion in net benefits for what the Trump administration claims is a $6 billion reduction in compliance costs.&nbsp; It concludes that this bad deal for consumers is really the &ldquo;best system of emissions reductions&rdquo; because it ignores that the power grid is highly interconnected. Instead, the EPA redefines BSER to only include minor tune-ups and other efficiencies that can be adopted at each individual facility, even if much cheaper reductions are available elsewhere. It also creates much more work for state environmental agencies by throwing out presumptive BSER levels and forcing states to start from scratch.</p>

<p>The companies that own coal-fired power plants support this new plan, but even they admit that they just aren&rsquo;t competitive in today&#39;s market and ACE isn&rsquo;t going to make much of a difference as to whether they stay in operation or retire. In fact, just days after the EPA released this proposal, First Energy announced its money-losing Bruce Mansfield plant--the largest coal-fired power plant in Pennsylvania--will close in 2021 unless the federal government steps in and forces consumers to pay higher electricity bills to bail them out.</p>

<p>We are being told that such a bail out is necessary because retiring coal plants are a threat to grid reliability. This simply isn&rsquo;t the case. If a power plant slated for retirement is actually needed, it can be designated as a reliability must-run (RMR) unit and be compensated accordingly on a temporary basis until system improvements can be completed and it can retire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There reality though is that with competition from cheaper natural gas and growth in clean renewable generation, these coal plants just aren&rsquo;t necessary. It&rsquo;s no surprise that no new coal plants are expected to be built in Pennsylvania and retirements of existing plants will continue. The five other large (&gt; 1GW) coal plants in Pennsylvania besides Bruce Mansfield are all 40 to to 50 years old and are nearing retirement. At least one of those plants, Brunner Island, is in the process of converting to natural gas, and others have admitted financial trouble.&nbsp; In spite of this, The EPA is claiming that ACE will result in a 4.5 to 5.8 percent increase in coal use--an obvious lie.</p>

<p>Just because ACE won&rsquo;t make much difference for the coal industry doesn&rsquo;t mean the administration has given up on a coal bail-out. A top Trump-appointee at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) recently said that they are working to identify plants they consider &ldquo;critical&rdquo; and find a way to &ldquo;value&rdquo; them. This follows a proposal from the Department of Energy last year asking FERC to &ldquo;value&rdquo; plants with more than 90-days of fuel on site (e.g. coal) in the name of &ldquo;resilience.&rdquo; In both of these cases, the word &ldquo;value&rdquo; means the same thing--it means forcing consumers like you to pay extra for dirty power that you don&rsquo;t want or need.</p>

How Artists Interpret Climate Change & Raise Awareness,9/13/2018,"<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/IMG%5F1471%2EJPG"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p>Recently, I was invited to be a judge of an art competition presented by the Whitaker Center in Harrisburg. It was their &ldquo;Summerscapes Upcycled Pizza Box Contest,&rdquo; in which artists of all ages used repurposed pizza boxes as their canvases to express their favorite summer moments. Many of the artists used &ldquo;recycled&rdquo; materials to create outdoor scenes to show what the they were paying attention to recently.</p>

<p>Because that is what artists do - they notice something &mdash; it could be a shape, a color, an idea, a moment, a person&mdash;and they pay attention to it. When they make their painting (or photograph, sculpture, play, story, dance, or music) they are asking us to pay attention to what they noticed as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Five months ago, I took the position of Director of Development for PennFuture. Before that, much of my career was in the arts. What I&rsquo;ve been noticing during the past five months is how much intersection there is between these two paths. There are a lot of artists&nbsp;of all types&nbsp;who are creating works that ask us to pay attention to the environment and climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I should have noticed this before, but isn&rsquo;t that what most of us say about climate change? </strong>My wife is a photographer and has been creating digital compositions with climate change themes for a few years now. I knew that she was paying attention to the issue, but were other artists?</p>

<p>To find my answer, I first visited the <a href=""https://artistsandclimatechange.com/"">&ldquo;Artists and Climate Change&rdquo; website</a>.&nbsp;It was created to encourage artists to create art, plays, books, operas, and more that go beyond the scientific facts of climate and engage people in the reality of its impact on our lives. Sometimes, the issue&nbsp;of climate change feels so big that it almost seems impossible to act. By encouraging and connecting individual artists to address this, the hope is that this huge issue can be broken down into &ldquo;small personal components.&rdquo; The quantity&nbsp;and variety&nbsp;of work being shared is inspiring. I have been personally moved by the work of <a href=""http://www.joansullivanphotography.com/"">&ldquo;renewable energy photographer&rdquo; Joan Sullivan.</a></p>

<p><strong>It turns out that many artists are paying attention and trying to do something.</strong> One of the most effective groups has been the <a href=""http://landartgenerator.org/"">Land Art Generator Initiative</a>, an international collective&nbsp;based in Pittsburgh, that for almost ten years has been connecting artists, architects, engineers, scientists, and local communities to create public art that somehow generates sustainable energy. A great example of this is <a href=""http://www.artenergycamp.org/"">Pittsburgh&rsquo;s &ldquo;Renaissance Gate</a>,&quot; which was developed by 20 children&mdash;ranging in age from 8 to 17&mdash;from the Homewood neighborhood during a 2015 LAG summer camp. The solar artwork now provides energy to the neighborhood they live in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This past summer, the artist Mel Chin created a &ldquo;mixed reality&rdquo; installation which allowed visitors in Times Square to &ldquo;experience&rdquo; what the tourist spot will look like when it becomes completely submerged by rising sea levels due to climate change. Looking up from &ldquo;under water&rdquo; through special Virtual Reality head-sets, users could see everything going on around them in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; and also see the bottoms of numerous boats and ships floating 26 feet above their heads. <a href=""https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/mel-chin-confronts-climate-change-times-square-virtual-reality-artwork-1317413#.W09UPQHT1iM.email"">The work is no longer in Times Square, but can be viewed through an app.</a></p>

<p>Many of the temporary sculptures and installations created for this year&rsquo;s recent Burning Man festival in the Nevada dessert had an environmental theme as well. Perhaps the most poignant was a 36 foot tall sculpture of a polar bear made by Don Kennell &amp; Lisa Adler out of over 100 repurposed car hoods. <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/long-view-a-polar-bear-stands-in-the-desert#/"">They will be touring this &ldquo;icon for global warming&rdquo; across the country in the coming months.</a></p>

<p>Not all work though is just about paying attention or generating energy. Artists are also taking action to prevent climate change. Miami Beach, where sea level rise is already a reality, launched a new artist in residence program last April at the Art Center of South Florida to spend a year exploring climate change - and trying to see what artists can do to prevent it. <a href=""https://news.artnet.com/art-world/miami-beach-artist-residency-rising-sea-levels-1306526#.WzPct5GwG20.email"">Artist and South Florida native Misael Soto was selected to spend the year meeting with city officials to learn and discover what artists can do to have an actual impact on the environment.</a></p>

<p><strong>Can artists truly prevent climate change?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but at least some are trying. As Jacquelyn Bonomo, PennFuture President and CEO, writes in her recent blog, with the scale of the climate problem we face, what we are doing right now is simply not enough. More must be done, and we all must take responsibility for doing something.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Michael Mann, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State and PennFuture Board Member tweets: &ldquo;Follow your heart. Climate change and environmental sustainability impacts every sector of civilization and every facet of our lives. Do what you&#39;re good at and enjoy doing and finding a way to change the world for the better while you&#39;re doing it.&rdquo;</p>

Of Floods and our Future,9/10/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Larry J. Schweiger, President Emeritus, PennFuture</strong></em></p>

<p>Pennsylvania has a history of floods but none like what we are experiencing today. The earliest floods recorded in 1786, 1810 and 1820 were called &quot;pumpkin floods&quot; because native Americans grew their pumpkins along rich floodplain soils. During fall hurricanes, pumpkins were swept into the rivers.</p>

<p>Later, loggers destroyed the virgin forests and fires burned. Passing storms and denuded mountainsides caused rapid runoff and flooded communities. The connection between denuded mountainsides and floods was clear in 1895 when Dr. Joseph Rothrock was hired as the first forestry commissioner to acquire and restore damaged forests. Rothrock warned, &quot;Unless we reforest, Pennsylvania&#39;s highlands will wash into the oceans.&rdquo; The Commonwealth purchased the worst of the denuded lands from lumber companies, creating many state forests.</p>

<p>Today, the pumpkins are gone and the hillsides are reforested, but cars are being washed away during unprecedented &quot;rain bomb&quot; events. The dramatic and unprecedented uptick in floods from superstorms and hurricanes is an early warning sign of what is coming our way in terms of the many impacts of climate change. Why are we experiencing increasing storms with record-breaking rainfall?</p>

<p>Simply put, our lawmakers have ignored scientific warnings for many decades, and now we are entering what will be a time for consequences. Yet, daily, humans continue to dump 110 million tons of heat-trapping pollution into the sky. It turns out that 93 percent of the energy trapped by carbon dioxide, methane, and other pollutants is channeled into the oceans. Warmer waters pump vast amounts of moisture into the skies. Heat equivalent to a staggering 400,000 Hiroshima-scale bombs is added to the oceans each and every day. Overheated waters produce elevated storm intensities.</p>

<p>Every corner of the world is experiencing the consequences of climate change. The American West has been overheated, drying out and catching on fire. The California firefighters painfully understand the results of our failure to end the burning of fossil fuels. The waters of the Gulf of Mexico and of the Caribbean don&#39;t flush well and are particularly vulnerable to overheating. From Hurricanes Katrina, Maria, and Harvey, Gulf Coast communities and our island territories have experienced unprecedented storms on steroids from hurricanes passing over overheated water.</p>

<p>The Northeast, including Pennsylvania, is increasingly vulnerable as the Gulf Stream warms and slows down. Let us not forget Superstorm Sandy or a much earlier Hurricane Agnes that destroyed 68,000 homes and ruined 3,000 businesses. On August 17th, Governor Tom Wolf signed a disaster emergency proclamation in response to a series of severe rainstorms up to ten inches in some areas that triggered damage to homes and businesses throughout much of north and central portions of the state. It was the second time in 2018 that the Governor declared a state of emergency as a massive snowstorm battered Eastern Pennsylvania and brought down thousands of trees and destroyed homes and businesses in the Poconos. Paradoxically, climate change can trigger more significant snowstorms as well as more winter rainfall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pittsburgh&rsquo;s February weather was a record breaker, including the warmest February day on record with temperatures nearly 40 degrees above normal and a 7&rdquo; month-long rainfall record. Saturated soils initiated mudslides in Duquesne Heights, Babcock Boulevard, Garfield, Spring Hill and Route 30 just to name a few of the dozens of massive landslides that occurred locally in 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1977 Johnstown flood is the kind of flood pattern we must fear. The storm just hung over the hills above Johnstown and caused 76 deaths, leaving $330 million in property damage. We are experiencing similar intense, often nearly-stationary &ldquo;rain bombs&rdquo; triggering flash-floods, mudslides overwhelming towns and roadways. When increased atmospheric water vapor combines with a disrupted and wavier Jetstream, strong storms can be held in place longer. A 4th of July storm hovered over Fox Chapel, O&#39;Hara Township and Aspinwall, flooding streets and bringing down trees and power lines. Twice in one week, the Delafield Road-Freeport Road area suffered substantial damage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What must we do to protect our communities from the ravages of floods?&nbsp;</strong>First, we must shut off the spigot of pollution by demanding that Congress overcome fossil-fuel&#39;s powerful grip and put a price on carbon emissions to quickly move our economy to carbon-free energy. Lawmakers must also incentivize efficient homes, cars, and businesses, cutting the demand for such fuels.</p>

<p>Second, historical 100-year floods are no longer a relevant land planning standard. Federal flood maps can&rsquo;t keep up with growing flood risks and must be redrawn based on climate modeling. Stormwater infrastructure must also be built with more significant storms in mind. Banks must say no to flawed construction in places with unstable slopes or flood-prone hazards. All new land developments must be required to hold much more runoff.</p>

<p>Third, to address the relentless mega-storms and multi-billion-dollar floods, the Federal Flood Insurance Program must be updated with rates that reflect the real costs of the risks and include all areas that are now vulnerable.</p>

<p>Finally, climate disruption is a relentless feature in our world, but we must work together to avoid the worst that will inevitably come if we continue to ignore the connection between pollution and destructive climatic forces. Let&#39;s put aside every political difference and work together to protect our children&#39;s future.</p>

The Urgency of Climate Change + Opportunities to Take Action,9/4/2018,"<p><strong>PennFuture marks September as Climate Month, along with communities around the state, nation, and world. Over the course of the next few weeks, we will provide you with blogs, events and a webinar that focus on and explore all aspects of climate change and its impact on Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</strong>On one hand, it&rsquo;s a somber moment as we watch the modest policy progress made over the last decade evaporate at the national level and Pennsylvania welcome natural gas, coal, and petrochemicals with open arms. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s a moment of clarity as we recognize that the time for incremental changes, multi-decade solutions, and tinkering around the edges, if there ever was one, is over.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://grist.org/climate-energy/what-would-wartime-mobilization-to-fight-climate-change-look-like/""><strong>As climate writer Dave Roberts puts it</strong></a>, the scale and speed at which we need to address climate change is nothing less than a &ldquo;war-time mobilization.&rdquo; Our country&rsquo;s most esteemed scientists, many of whom teach and live in Pennsylvania, have been ringing the alarm for decades that human activity is fundamentally changing the chemistry of the atmosphere. In our own communities and families, we have undoubtedly seen a heartbreaking increase in the frequency of Lyme disease, occurrences of asthma, and destruction caused by climate-fueled weather events. As Pennsylvania&rsquo;s scientists note, none of this can be explained away by anything other than the fact nature around us is changing&hellip;rapidly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I recently met with several of PennFuture&rsquo;s most steadfast friends, who suggested that a climate equivalent of Pearl Harbor was needed to wake people up to the climate crisis. We simply cannot wait for another focusing moment to occur, as if Hurricane Florence, Superstorm Sandy, California wildfires, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Irma, Midwest flooding and severe weather outbreaks, and western drought aren&rsquo;t enough. We are in the midst of such peril&mdash;as I sometimes like to put it, we are &ldquo;fiddling while Rome burns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Washington, D.C., the Obama administration&rsquo;s response to the climate crisis&mdash;the Paris Climate Accord, the Clean Power Plan and vehicle efficiency standards&mdash;has been replaced by the Trump administration&rsquo;s plan to rollback vehicle emission standards, boost the use of coal, and expand drilling in our oceans and forest lands. It&rsquo;s a coordinated attack on our wellbeing by corporate right unraveling our air, water, and climate protections to squeeze out another ounce of profit on the backs of our public health.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The policy situation here in Pennsylvania isn&rsquo;t much better.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve rolled out a red carpet for Shell Global&rsquo;s cracker plant in western Pennsylvania with a $1.62 billion subsidy from tax payers. Our economic development officials continue to tout Pennsylvania as the next big boom for the petrochemical and plastics industry. We&rsquo;ve lent a helping subsidy to coal by reopening mines in the anthracite region, and they celebrate the opening of new metallurgic mines in the southwest part of the state. Like I said: fiddling while Rome burns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say Pennsylvania isn&rsquo;t doing anything positive in the realm of creating solutions to the climate crisis. I&rsquo;m supportive of the $2,000 rebate program for alternative fuel vehicles just announced by the PA Department of Environmental Protection. The state recently implemented its first ever methane controls on new oil and gas infrastructure. The state is beginning to force bad actors to plug abandoned and leaking gas wells. We just passed Commercial PACE legislation that opens new opportunities for commercial building owners to lower their energy consumption and bills. And Governor Wolf is staunchly condemning Trump&rsquo;s abandonment of clean car standards. <strong>All of these policy choices matter, but with the scale of the climate problem we face, it&rsquo;s simply not enough.</strong></p>

<p>We have a political problem here in Pennsylvania, as we do nationally. Climate change is running well out ahead of us and we are losing our chance to act decisively and significantly. We are dragging our feet on the policy decisions that will actually make a dent in the problem: state methane regulations for existing oil and gas infrastructure, eliminating subsidies for oil, coal, and natural gas, investing significantly in next-generation renewable energy technologies, aggressively updating Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, and implementing carbon pricing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This shortsightedness&mdash;especially the blindness of our policy officials to the economic opportunity of investing in renewable energy&mdash;will not only dig us a climate hole we may not be able to escape from, but also put the Commonwealth at an economic disadvantage for decades to come while saddling our citizens with the health and environmental impacts of these misguided investments in gas and coal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the fight must go on and there is important work being done to overcome the stranglehold the fossil fuel industry has over the Commonwealth&rsquo;s climate and energy policy and implement the type of wartime mobilization we need. I am proud of a new program being developed by PennFuture called Clean Energy Communities. Being piloted in Pittsburgh, the program is working with communities and their elected officials to take ownership of their climate future and advance renewable energy in their municipalities and reduce their carbon footprint. Our expectation is to expand this program around the state as there are hundreds of local communities that have overwhelmingly expressed their determination to meet carbon reduction goals, with or without state or federal action.</p>

<p>PennFuture is also working with the PA DEP and over 500 stakeholders on the Finding PA&rsquo;s Solar Future project. The goal of the project is to model scenarios for increasing solar energy deployment in Pennsylvania and to discuss the best pathways for doing so. PennFuture has convened stakeholder meetings, engaged with thought leaders, and is helping organize a statewide report on the potential for solar energy moving forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, there is tremendous energy around this election cycle&mdash;I feel it everywhere. More and more citizens are tired of getting their health, clean water, and air quality thrown under the proverbial bus through the guise of &ldquo;smaller government&rdquo; or &ldquo;cutting red tape.&rdquo; Through PennFuture&rsquo;s civic engagement program, we&rsquo;re elevating the public debate on environmental issues around the Commonwealth and engaging in nonpartisan voter education ahead of November 6th. I am so proud of the work being done by our partner organization, Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, as they shine a spotlight how well or not our elected officials are doing on environmental legislation and votes. <a href=""https://www.conservationpa.org/scorecard""><strong>They recently published its 2017 &ndash; 18 legislative scorecard and you should take a look.</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Without a doubt, more needs to be done and PennFuture will continue to build out its climate programming to continue matching the monumental task ahead. </strong>We hope that you&mdash;our supporters, readers, and the general public&mdash;will join in the discussion on how best to do this in Pennsylvania. During climate month, PennFuture is hosting a number of events around the Commonwealth to advance climate protections. I hope you&rsquo;ll be able to join us. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/events""><strong>Click here to visit our events page to get involved.</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>In closing, I believe that Climate Month is no longer a time to raise general awareness on climate or calling for simply any action. Rather, it&rsquo;s now a moment to note what we realistically have to do, no matter how much of an uphill battle it may seem from the outset. </strong>We&rsquo;ve moved past the need for small policy changes and into an era where immediate and urgent mobilization is all we have left to meet this challenge. I want to personally thank all of those who are trying every day in the public&rsquo;s service to overcome this climate challenge. I&rsquo;m sure there have been many moments in the last couple of years where it seems hopeless, but we can&rsquo;t relent. Together, let&rsquo;s keep going.&nbsp;</p>

Monroe County College Campus Journeys to Clean Energy and Efficiency,8/29/2018,"<div>The Monroe Campus of Northampton Community College in the Poconos strikes gold and more on an environmental journey.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, as designated by the U.S. Green Building Council, is more than a symbol of excellence in green building.&nbsp; It represents a standard of environmental stewardship that succeeds in &ldquo;acting on the triple bottom line - putting people, planet and profit first.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>While Northampton Community College (NCC) is celebrating its 30th year in Monroe County, it was just over 10 years ago that NCC held a &ldquo;Monroe Dream Session&rdquo; with its faculty and staff, board of trustees and students to formulate a vision for a new campus that would serve all of Monroe County. One of the most important parts of the vision was that the new campus would become an example of responsible environmental stewardship whether it ended up becoming silver, gold or platinum LEED.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In December 2015, NCC had a special ceremony on campus to announce that it had indeed met the goal of becoming LEED Gold as certified by the U.S Green Building Council. But that certification did not happen easily &ndash; nor did it happen as originally planned. As with all big vision projects, it took time to get things started. There were zigs and zags, and an economic downturn in 2008 that almost derailed the entire project. It took a lot of passion and dedication by many to stay the course to complete the current campus in Monroe County that is so valued by the students and faculty.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I was privileged to speak with Matt Connell, Dean of the Monroe Campus of NCC for the past 24 years, about the journey that took the NCC &ndash; Monroe campus from more humble college grounds by renting high school buildings all the way to Gold LEED building status.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Back in 1998, I learned that NCC was selling off an old campus and then utilized high school buildings and the local Chamber of Commerce site as classrooms in the evening for their students &ndash; approximately 600 of them! They also rented space in downtown Stroudsburg for a couple of years until they decided they needed a more permanent location.&nbsp; As Dean Connell says, they bought what was then an old blouse factory in Tannersville &ndash; right off of 611 &ndash; and it became as he would lovingly call it, &ldquo;A 10,000 square foot one room schoolhouse &ndash; a couple of classrooms, computer labs and some snack machines.&rdquo;&nbsp; NCC added some modular trailers to increase its capacity as its enrollment grew.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Incredibly, NCC went through two phases of expansion at that original campus and eventually grew to a 40,000 square foot facility campus to accommodate up to 2,200 students through 2002. But NCC really needed to add more space. The original campus, while it had classrooms, science labs and some administrative offices with a small library had, according to Connell, &ldquo;NO Student space. The campus lacked all of the amenities that students look for when they come to a college campus.&rdquo; But, he said all of those shortcomings at a commuter campus really spurred them on to add to the student space that is now in existence on their campus. He said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what led to the Dream Day.&rdquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>When I asked about how NCC was able to engage the local Monroe community to help the project move forward financially, Connell said it was more of a yin and yang experience at the beginning. While NCC did seek support from the local community in a couple of different ways, because of the market forces happening with the collapse of the housing market in 2008, there were different schools of thought as to what the community could do. Connell stated that three years ago, folks in the banking field shared information with him &ldquo;that showed&nbsp; Monroe County took it on the chin more than once when the housing market crashed. He added, &ldquo;Real estate taxes in Monroe County are some of the highest in the state.&rdquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The dean indicated that the market force essentially galvanized a lot of folks in the community to say,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&rdquo;We&rsquo;re already paying school taxes, we&rsquo;re not going to take on another tax to support a community college, so &ndash; again, it wasn&rsquo;t the purpose of what we were doing, it was more their engagement with it.&nbsp; In many ways, it was just poor timing!&rdquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>When I asked the dean what came out of the construction process that was notable for him, he replied that while he has spoken about how important it was for NCC &ndash; Monroe Campus to get the LEED certification, one of the things that impressed him personally and professionally, as the construction process took place, was learning that 80 percent of the waste generated in the construction of this campus was recycled.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I did not realize that was part of the LEED certification &ndash; so that was really impressive,&rdquo; he said.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>He added that &ldquo;a key part of minimum LEED certification was that the delivery of materials and supplies and equipment to build and equip this campus could come only from a radius of a certain distance because of minimizing the impact on the environment with exhaust emissions from all vehicles that were bringing materials and equipment to build the campus.&rdquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Having toured the campus this past spring, I can say that everything about this campus has been designed for energy efficiency and sustainability. It is what you would call a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; school with all energy use constantly monitored and adjusted by computer to maximize clean energy efficiency.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>The NCC Monroe campus Environmental Fact sheet shows they now have:</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Solar Voltaic System</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>2090 solar panels producing 637 kW of power</li>
	<li>Provides about 40% of the campus annual electric needs</li>
	<li>Generates over 700,000 kWh per year, or enough electricity to power 70 homes</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Campus HVAC Management System</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Trane Tracer Computerized Energy Management System</li>
	<li>Monitors and Controls over 4,000 points through out the campus</li>
	<li>Saves over 660,000 kWh per year, or enough electricity to power 60 homes.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Campus Lighting Management System</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Lutron Computerized Lighting Management System</li>
	<li>Monitors and controls over 10,000 lights throughout the campus</li>
	<li>Saves over 450,000 kWh per year, or enough electricity to power 45 homes</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Geothermal Heating and Cooling System</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>164 wells that are 450 feet deep</li>
	<li>Closed loop, meaning water is recirculated, not extracted from the ground</li>
	<li>Provides 100% of the campus heating and cooling needs</li>
	<li>Saves over 200,000 kWh per year, or enough electricity to power 20 homes.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Wind Turbine System</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>10kW Bergey wind turbine on an 80 ft tower</li>
	<li>Started operation April 2016</li>
	<li>Expected to generate over11,200kW per year</li>
</ul>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I asked the Dean what challenges lay ahead for the college now that the GOLD certification is complete and has been operating for awhile. He said that while they are proud that they have the full package that is having a positive impact on the environment, they have more to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&ldquo;From a systems point of view, everything is operating as it should be on the solar panel system, on the geothermal wells, on the lighting, heating and cooling. Everything is working as it should be. With mechanical systems, you are always going to have breakdowns and things, so that part is working well. From a programmatic point of view, the thing we must do as a college now is figure out how to access and leverage all of the resources that we have at this GOLD LEED certified campus and convert it into an educational program that prepares individuals to be able to manage future LEED certified programs and campuses or buildings,&rdquo; he said.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&ldquo;In our minds, there will be a number of these projects taking place over the next 10 or 15 years, and each one will build upon and learn from the previous project. But they&rsquo;ll need trained individuals to manage those complex operations daily &ndash; and leverage and maximize the ability of those places to limit impact on the environment. Our next step is to figure out how to convert that to a credential that is marketable and those individuals employed in that field.&nbsp; That will be a growing field over the next 10 or 15 years.&rdquo;</div>

<div>As to what the Dean hopes for the future of the college, he says that the legacy of the institution always looks to leave is one of, &rdquo;We did everything we could as an institution to help students succeed and achieve the dreams and goals that they have whether it&rsquo;s with one class or degree &ndash; and we did everything we could using the high touch, high tech approach that really engages students in meaningful ways, and in doing so, helped them gain confidence and help them recognize that they can achieve a number of things that they were not always sure about before they got to us.&rdquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>NC Monroe County has certainly struck GOLD with more than their LEED building.&nbsp; Their accountability on environmental impacts is impressive and they are taking the next steps to grow leaders in this field.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thank you to the NCC Board of Trustees, faculty and students and Dean Connell who started the &ldquo;dream day&rdquo; and made it happen in Monroe County!&nbsp;</div>

"Clean Water Rule Revived in PA, Protecting Our Headwater Streams and Wetlands",8/22/2018,"<p>Last week, a federal district court in South Carolina threw out the Trump Administration&rsquo;s unlawful attempt to delay the effective date of the Clean Water Rule &ndash; which was enacted in 2015 &ndash; resulting in its reestablishment in Pennsylvania and 25 other states.</p>

<p>The 2015 Clean Water Rule is a scientifically-supported rule, in line with the purpose of the federal Clean Water Act, that protects sensitive and critical headwaters and wetlands, which in turn protects the water quality for thousands of steam miles in the Commonwealth and the drinking water supplies used by millions of Pennsylvanians.&nbsp;PennFuture supports the Clean Water Rule and its clear protections of our waters, which provide further benefits to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s outdoor recreational economy as well as communities and small businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Background</strong></u><br />
The Clean Water Rule was promulgated on August 28, 2015 to clarify the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; under the federal Clean Water Act.&nbsp;It notably extended clean water protections for small, intermittent and ephemeral streams and wetlands that had a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; to traditionally navigable waters.&nbsp; The Clean Water Rule was based on the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; as described by Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy&rsquo;s concurring opinion in <em>Rapanos v. United States</em>, 547 U.S. 715 (2006), which protected any waters that had a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; to navigable streams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon taking office in 2017, President Trump took aim at the Clean Water Rule and directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers to rescind the Rule and replace it with a new, more limiting definition consistent with the late-Justice Anthony Scalia&rsquo;s majority &ldquo;continuing surface water connection&rdquo; opinion in <em>Rapanos</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In July 2017, the Trump Administration proposed to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule. The agencies received over 685,000 public comments on the proposed repeal, with the majority of the comments (over 500,000) opposing the repeal of the Clean Water Rule. (<a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2017-09-27-PennFuture-Clean-Water-Rule-Repeal-Public-Comments-%28EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203%29.pdf"">Read PennFuture&rsquo;s comments here.</a>)&nbsp;This repeal rule has not been finalized, and no replacement rule has yet been proposed.</p>

<p>Apparently concerned that its proposed repeal would not withstand judicial scrutiny, the Trump Administration in November 2017 concocted a proposed rule that would add a new &ldquo;applicability date&rdquo; to the Clean Water Rule in an attempt to essentially override the August 28, 2015 effective date of the Rule.&nbsp;Over 4,500 public comments were submitted (<a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2017-12-13-PennFuture-Clean-Water-Rule-Applicability-Date-Public-Comments-%28EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0644.%29.pdf"">read PennFuture&rsquo;s comments here</a>), and on January 31, 2018, the Trump Administration finalized the &ldquo;Delay Rule&rdquo; such that the 2015 Clean Water Rule would not be effective until February 6, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Numerous lawsuits challenging the Delay Rule were filed across the country.&nbsp;One of these lawsuits, filed in the federal District Court of South Carolina, argued that the Trump Administration failed to follow the procedural rules set forth in the federal Administrative Procedures Act (APA) in promulgating the Delay Rule.&nbsp; On August 16, 2018, <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2018-08-16-South-Carolina-Dist.-%28SELC%29.pdf""><strong>the District Court agreed, and imposed a nationwide injunction on the Delay Rule.</strong></a></p>

<p>Because of this ruling, the Clean Water Rule has been reinstated in the following 26 states, pending finalization of the proposed repeal rule: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. (For the remaining 24&nbsp;states, two courts had previously enjoined the Clean Water Rule from taking effect, and thus the South Carolina injunction on the Delay Rule does not impact the status of the Clean Water Rule in those states.)</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture has long-supported the Clean Water Rule and its protection of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s critical headwater streams and wetlands.&nbsp;We will continue to vocalize our support for the Clean Water Rule, and will keep you informed of any updates in this ongoing battle.</strong></p>

<p>9/12/18 UPDATE:&nbsp;Yesterday, a federal court in Texas blocked the implementation of the Clean Water Rule in three southern states (Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana), but stopped short on issuing a nationwide injunction on the Clean Water Rule.&nbsp; Consequently, the Clean Water Rule is now in effect in 23 states, including Pennsylvania.</p>

Trump's Proposed Car Emissions Rollback Would Prevent States from Protecting Citizens,8/21/2018,"<p><a href=""https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2018/08/trumps_proposed_car_emissions.html""><em><strong>This blog post originally appeared as an opinion piece published in Harrisburg&#39;s PennLive on Aug. 11.</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Transportation emissions now surpass electric generation as the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States. But with millions of gas guzzling vehicles on the road and car culture so ingrained in society, reducing these emissions is difficult. To continue addressing this complicated problem, President Barack Obama worked with automakers in 2012 to negotiate a cost-effective increase in vehicle efficiency standards that would cut carbon and reduce gasoline consumption, while keeping our automobile industry competitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The automakers agreed with the new efficiency standards at the time, but they have seen an opportunity to cut a new deal under the Trump Administration. Trump quickly acquiesced to the automakers&rsquo; requests, and his EPA has rushed out a proposed rollback under the Orwellian title, &ldquo;The Safer and Affordable Fuel Efficient Vehicles Proposed Rule for Model Years 2021-2026.&rdquo; This new regulation would freeze federal fuel economy standards at 2020 levels and keep states from protecting their citizens with higher standards.</p>

<p>Unbelievably, this rollback goes well beyond what the automakers initially asked for. Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company recently said they &ldquo;support increasing clean car standards through 2025 and are not asking for a rollback.&rdquo; He went on to say that Ford &ldquo;believe[s] we must deliver on CO2 reductions consistent with the Paris Climate Accord.&rdquo; What the automakers wanted was some added flexibility in compliance, but what they got was a ham-fisted attempt at eliminating agreed-to standards that would have led to affordable cars that are the cleanest in our automakers&rsquo; history.</p>

<p>This new move is impossible to justify along any economic, public health, good governance, engineering, or scientific lines of argument. The EPA already determined in 2017 that existing standards are achievable by the auto industry and the technologies to meet the standards already exist -- the European Union requires even higher standards. We also know that repealing the standards will result in lower gas mileage that could cost drivers more than $2,000 at the pump over the life of their vehicles. The Trump plan will also increase foreign imports of oil by millions of gallons, add millions of tons of carbon pollution to the air, and increase asthma-causing and smog-forming pollutants.</p>

<p>EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation Bill Wehrum gives a tortured justification for this action. He claims that not having to meet new pollution standards will save the automakers money. He then assumes that automakers will pass the savings on to consumers; that the savings will make enough difference that people will buy newer and safer cars; and, safer cars will, in turn, mean fewer fatalities in car accidents. So, he argues, we have to make drivers pay more at the pump, import more foreign oil, and damage the environment for &ldquo;safety&rdquo; reasons. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who is one of 19 state attorneys general who have announced that they will challenge this action, put it plainly saying, &ldquo;The data and science do not back up what they&rsquo;re trying to do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Attorney General Shapiro is right to challenge this regulation. The Commonwealth has long since opted to protect its citizens and the environment with fuel efficiency standards that are stronger than the minimum federal requirements--this new rule takes away that option. Instead, we will be forced to accept a one-size-fits-all federal rule that assumes our automakers can&rsquo;t make cars as clean and efficient as other countries are already making.</p>

<p>States normally have significant authority to regulate pollution inside their borders, but there are cases where federal law prohibits states from creating their own rules. Almost everyone agrees that forcing auto manufacturers to create different versions of each model-year car to comply with up to 50 different state fuel efficiency rules would be expensive and create logistical problems. So, when Congress passed the Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act in 1965, it added Section 209 to the Clean Air Act (CAA) that typically prevents states from creating their own vehicle emissions standards.</p>

<p>There is one important exception though: California was already regulating vehicle emissions before the EPA, so the CAA doesn&rsquo;t take that power away. Instead, if California determines that their standards are at least as stringent as the federal standards; the EPA is obligated to waive Section 209 unless it has an acceptable reason not to. Once California receives that waiver, other states like Pennsylvania can legally opt-in to California&rsquo;s standards--that is what Pennsylvania, along with thirteen other states and the District of Columbia, have done.</p>

<p>Everyone would probably prefer a single national standard, and the Obama administration&rsquo;s emissions guidelines were a major step in that direction, but not all states face the same problems. Pennsylvania, with more than 100 billion miles of vehicle travel every year, has more than 20 times the vehicle usage than a state like Alaska. We also have many more citizens living in communities with poor air quality. It makes sense that states like Pennsylvania have the right to adopt more stringent standards to protect their citizens, and that&rsquo;s just what we did.</p>

<p>If the Trump administration succeeds in withdrawing the California waiver, that also takes the choice away from Pennsylvania. Not only is the President not listening to the auto manufacturers, he&rsquo;s also ignoring the needs of our communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Exceptional Waters Define the Poconos & Deserve Protection,8/21/2018,"<p><a href=""http://www.poconorecord.com/opinion/20180815/my-turn-exceptional-waters-define-poconos-and-deserve-protection""><em><strong>This blog post originally appeared as a &quot;My Turn&quot; column published in the Pocono Record on Aug. 15.</strong></em></a></p>

<p>When I was a child growing up in Hazleton, I generously described where I was from as the &ldquo;western Poconos.&rdquo; After I learned how to ski at Camelback, became a rafting guide on the Lehigh, and later an angler who understood the holy nature of the Delaware River and its tributaries to fishing, I better understood my desire to be associated with the Poconos, its natural beauty and pristine waters.</p>

<p>The wild beauty and abundance of clean and exceptional waters of the Poconos has attracted generations of families, businesses, institutions, and tourists to invest in something here - be it the whole of their lives, a second home, their vacation time and recreation funds, or the dollars needed for major industry or small and family businesses to succeed. In fact, tourism has underpinned the wellbeing of the region, and travel tourism brings $3.5 billion to the area annually, according to Pocono Mountains Tourism Bureau, Pocono Mountain Tourism Fast Facts 2018. Together, people and businesses created a Pocono region that has been able to thrive and coexist with the environment &ndash; but now, that coexistence is threatened.</p>

<p>A new vision for Pocono tourism is now being touted, one that PennFuture and several of our local partners, neighbors and advocates do not support.&nbsp; This vision translates into major development schemes that will change the region. Instead of integrating with the land and water of this special place as businesses have done historically, the preference is to develop through wholesale clearing of forests and daylighting of shaded streams. In the place of previously natural areas, there are now swaths of macadam, concrete and swales that &ldquo;manage&rdquo; rainwater and snowmelt because artificial surfaces just can&rsquo;t absorb water as effectively as a forest.</p>

<p>Some holders of these big ideas and investors in this kind of development are finding it problematic to develop the Poconos in line with the rules that have made this place special for decades. We can&rsquo;t conjecture on why that is, but let&rsquo;s assume that some will argue that it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;too expensive&rdquo; to plan and engineer a development that discharges its used water into a stream in the same condition it was in when it was withdrawn from its source. We believe the majority of Pocono residents, businesses and visitors feel it is appropriate for everyone to share the responsibility for clean water, especially in a place like the Pocono region that is actually defined by its healthy environment. Also, according to the Pocono Mountain Tourism Fast Facts 2018, &ldquo;Tourism in the Pocono Mountains contributes to the triple bottom line (economic, social, and environmental) like no other industry in the region.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture and its partners are launching Our Pocono Waters Campaign to bring this issue to light and to protect the exceptional streams of our region. </strong>Through this campaign, we are working to bring awareness to the exceptional waters of the Poconos and the value the region ascribes to them. We hope to communicate to elected officials and business leaders that there are many more people who value the outstanding water quality in the Poconos than those who want to compromise our historic, pristine waters for their own benefit.</p>

<p><strong>We look forward to maintaining the legacy of natural beauty in the Poconos while supporting thoughtful, responsible development, and hope you will join us by visiting <a href=""http://www.ourpoconowaters.org"">www.ourpoconowaters.org</a> to learn more.</strong></p>

PennFuture’s Leadership Tour Explores the Poconos,7/30/2018,"<div><em><strong>By Nancy Wottrich, Member of PennFuture&rsquo;s President&rsquo;s Leadership Council.</strong></em></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PennFuture&rsquo;s Spring 2018 President&#39;s Leadership Council Tour was held in the Poconos of Northeast PA over the course of two days in which we discovered this beautiful region, learning about its natural and human history and discussing some of the pressing environmental issues currently threatening the area.&nbsp; If I were to sum up my experience on this tour with just a few words, they would be &ldquo;progressing, connecting and reflecting.&rdquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Progressing:</strong> While some in decision-making positions persist in holding back alternative energy growth in this country, visionary individuals and groups are forging ahead to a fossil-free future &ndash; and the movement continues to expand. Mark Culp, Physical Plant Director of Northampton Community College&rsquo;s Monroe Campus, provided our group with an in-depth tour of this Gold LEED facility. Everything about this campus has been designed for energy efficiency and sustainability. Impressively, all energy use is constantly monitored and adjusted by computer to maximize efficiency.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Connecting:</strong> To paraphrase author John McPhee, it&rsquo;s not enough to just fight to protect the places we cherish.&nbsp; We need to make time to enjoy them as well &ndash; to connect through learning about them, to experience their raw beauty and strength, and to immerse ourselves in nature&rsquo;s solitude, peace and healing qualities. From this comes our perseverance to keep up the fight.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Short of its former reputation as the &ldquo;Honeymoon Capital of the East,&rdquo; the Poconos area is also known for its clear, cold tannin streams that tumble off the plateau in a series of spectacular waterfalls. Home to native brook trout, these streams were coveted by elite fly-fishing clubs that bought up large tracts of land to protect their private playgrounds.&nbsp; Coupled with this are equally large tracts of state forest lands scattered around the plateau and down the escarpment to the Delaware River.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>As a result of these protected lands, many of the Poconos streams have been classified as &ldquo;Exceptional Value&rdquo; because they have the best and cleanest conditions.&nbsp; This status also affords them the highest level of protection when it comes to runoff, discharge and land disruption.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Along the banks of Cranberry Creek in VanBuskirk Preserve, native ferns and wildflowers abound under the shade of hemlocks and rhododendron.&nbsp; Rocks in the streams are carpeted with thick layers of moss and tree bark covered in lichens attest to the clean air quality. Water splashing over rocks and a symphony of bird songs are the music here. There is a peacefulness that washes over one standing in a place like this &ndash; a connection that is found no where else than in the midst of nature.&nbsp; This preserve has protected one small fragment of precious habitat that once was found throughout the region. Exploring the creek further and with the aid of aquatic biologist Eric Baird, we sampled for macro-invertebrates. The kinds of species and quantity of each found can tell one a lot about the overall health of the stream.&nbsp; The greatest diversity is found in cold, clear waters, like those in the Poconos, and provide food for the trout that reside here.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>It naturally followed that after learning about the Pocono streams, we should have the opportunity to enjoy them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some in the group were treated to private guided fly-fishing excursions on several of the famous trout streams in this area.&nbsp; While I am not a fly fisher person, I can certainly relate to the zen-like nature of the sport.&nbsp; Standing quietly along a babbling stream, tuned in to the insect hatch and skillfully laying down a hand-made duplicate ever so gently onto the surface of the water.&nbsp; And of course the exhilaration of the catch, should one be so lucky!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Others in the group experienced the soggy and solitary nature of Tannersville Cranberry Bog, a property of The Nature Conservancy.&nbsp; Nestled within 1,000 acres of protected land, this is the southern most boreal bog east of the Mississippi River.&nbsp; Here sphagnum moss slowly decays into peat, forming a layer over 40 feet thick and carnivorous plants thrive in the nutrient poor soil.&nbsp; As night descended, the bog chorus of birds and amphibians amplified. Even though the main road was less than a quarter mile away, it felt like we could have been deep in the wilderness.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am eternally grateful to the individuals who had the foresight to protect this unique habitat.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Covering more than 130 square miles throughout the Pocono region, the protected lands of Delaware State Forest have become a haven for native plants and wildlife and a refuge for the Golden-winged Warbler, a species declining so rapidly that it has been a candidate for the federal Endangered Species List.&nbsp; Loss of its very specific habitat along with Blue-winged Warbler hybridization have brought the bird to extremely low levels in Pennsylvania. Bruce McNaught, a member of PennFuture&rsquo;s Leadership Council and a consulting biologist for the Pa. Game Commission, has been surveying this bird in the Poconos for over 10 years.&nbsp; With his leadership, we toured areas of the state forest currently being managed for Golden-winged Warbler restoration. Thanks to the research of people like Bruce, recommendations from the International Golden-winged Warbler Group and coordinated efforts through the PA Bureau of Forestry, critical habitat management is occurring, and small stable populations of this species persist in Pike County.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Reflecting: </strong>Will we humans ever learn to live in harmony with our earth? It has been said we learn from our mistakes, but too often that is not the case when it comes to economic growth and setting environmental policy.&nbsp; Be it ego, greed or misguided beliefs, we continue to make the same mistakes, and the health of our planet takes a hit each time. A very informative tour of Gray Towers, home of Gifford Pinchot brought home this point.&nbsp; As the first director of the US Forest Service, two-time PA governor, life-long conservationist and outdoor enthusiast, both Pinchot&rsquo;s professional and life philosophy was centered around wise use of our resources to benefit humankind, while still preserving the integrity of those resources.&nbsp; A book his father gave him on his 21st birthday instilled this ethic in him.&nbsp; The book, &ldquo;Man and Nature:&nbsp; The Earth as Modified by Human Action&rdquo; was published in 1864 and addressed the concern that human actions were causing dire consequences to the health of the earth. A highlighted quote caught my eye.&nbsp; It was written 154 years ago, but sadly the message is still as applicable today: &ldquo;Man depends upon soil, water, plants and animals.&nbsp; But in securing his <span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>livelihood, he may unwittingly destroy the fabric of nature that supports him.&nbsp;Therefore, men must learn to understand their environment and how they <span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>affect it.&nbsp; And they must take action, individual and collective to restore and <span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>maintain a more viable setting. &ldquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Interlaced with our enrichment experiences was serious discussion about the current environmental issues facing this region, including climate change, land development, and water quality, some of the issues PennFuture is tackling.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Streams in the Poconos, and streams in general, were used as dump sites for eons.&nbsp; &nbsp;Flowing into the Delaware River, the water source for over 15 million people, the quality of these streams is critical. Regulations established to clean them up have been very successful, and both the flora and fauna have rebounded. Now, however, many of those regulations are being challenged and attacked, and the result could be a return to the unhealthy and polluted conditions these streams previously endured.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The economic revival of the Pocono region has seen an increase in land development, with expansion of housing, businesses and resort complexes.&nbsp;While this may be good for the economy, it must not be at the cost of habitat loss and ecological degradation. Tourism and outdoor recreation are the basis of this region&rsquo;s economy.&nbsp; There are proven ways to have the growth that feeds the tourism industry without destroying that which attracts them in the first place.&nbsp; Businesses, industry and environmental groups must work together to reach agreements on how to provide for growth while preserving the resources, wild places and natural beauty.&nbsp; PennFuture&rsquo;s challenge and initiative is to make this the pivotal point upon which decisions for this region are based.&nbsp;</div>

How Climate Change is Affecting Baseball Games Across the Country,7/30/2018,"<p>Recently, the Harrisburg Senators had to cancel its game against the Bowie Baysox in anticipation of the Susquehanna River flooding out City Island. Like many others, I was disappointed because I was looking forward to an evening of cheering on the home team. I was also disappointed because the Senators had planned to host their first ever &ldquo;Go Green&rdquo; night to benefit and promote a number of local environmental organizations, including PennFuture. The Senators are to be applauded for organizing this promotion and I greatly look forward to participating in it next season&mdash;as long as City Island isn&rsquo;t flooded again.</p>

<p>Rainouts have always been a part of baseball, but are we seeing something different? Thanks to climate change, abnormal weather conditions are becoming the new normal. This year&rsquo;s baseball season opened with a record 28 major league games being postponed in April because of weather conditions. Having a ballpark on an island certainly makes the minor league Senators more vulnerable to inclement weather, but what we are experiencing this summer is extreme.</p>

<p>Dr. Michael Mann, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State and PennFuture Board Member says, &ldquo;The extreme weather we are seeing this summer around the Northern Hemisphere (i.e. extreme heatwaves, floods, droughts, and wildfires), including the extreme rainfall seen recently here in Pennsylvania, is related to an unusually stationary, highly meandering perturbation in the jet stream. Our work (i.e. this article last year: <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45242"">https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45242</a>) shows that this sort of pattern, which has been associated with many of the most extreme, persistent weather events in recent years including the 2003 European heat wave, 2010 Moscow wildfires, 2011 Texas &amp; Oklahoma drought, 2016 Alberta wildfires etc., is becoming more common because of human-caused climate change (and in particular, because of amplified Arctic warming).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rainouts and flooding are not the only threats to America&rsquo;s oldest pastime. <a href=""http://blog.nwf.org/2018/07/how-will-climate-change-affect-the-future-of-baseball/"">According to a recent report from the National Wildlife Federation</a> the high humidity that much of the country is experiencing is making the balls heavier with moisture, and it is easier to hit a home-run with a heavier ball&mdash;and not just in the Colorado Rockies ballpark where they&rsquo;ve been storing their baseballs in humidors since 2002. For 2018, the MLB has mandated that all teams store their balls in an &ldquo;air conditioned and enclosed room&rdquo; with a sensor to help determine if every team should be required to use humidors.</p>

<p>Another issue affecting baseball, according to NWF, relates not to the balls, but the bats. The invasive Emerald ash borer beetle has killed millions of ash trees since 2002. And ash happens to be one of the most popular woods for making baseball bats. Unfortunately, like games in April and infield hits, the ash bat may become a thing of the past for baseball fans because of climate change.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/03/29/poll-most-pennsylvania-voters-say-climate-change-causing-problems-now/"">According to a Franklin &amp; Marshall College/StateImpact Pennsylvania poll this spring</a>, the majority of us in PA believe that climate change is causing problems right now and that the state should be doing more to address it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Confronting a problem of this magnitude can seem overwhelming. Individually, we all have a voice &ndash; collectively, we have impact. PennFuture amplifies this voice. Recently, we worked with a coalition of 25 unified environmental groups across the state to create the first-ever Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda. The Common Agenda is a comprehensive blueprint the next governor can use to address our environmental challenges. It provides the candidates with common sense solutions for the state to move towards a clean energy economy and increase environmental protection for our most vulnerable communities, and just maybe our baseball parks too. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Updated-Final-Version-of-the-PA-Common-Conservation-Agenda-5.1.18.pdf"">You can read the Common Agenda here&nbsp;while waiting for the rain delay to end.</a></p>

What You Can Do For Your Watershed,7/30/2018,"<p>On Wednesday, July 18, I met with a dedicated group of citizen scientists&nbsp;who gathered to learn more about how to get involved with policy in their watershed. Hosted at the Visitor Center of the Pennypack Ecological Restoration Trust in the Pennypack Preserve, 15 volunteers from watershed organizations throughout the greater Philadelphia area participated, including representatives from the Wissahickon Valley Watershed Association, the Tookany-Tacony/Frankford Watershed Partnership, Pennypack Ecological Restoration Trust, and Friends of Poquessing Watershed.</p>

<p>Citizen scientists play an important role in protecting our waterways. Watershed organizations have recruited and trained volunteers to sample water quality and look for signs of pollution that traditional surveys may have missed. Citizen scientists are trained to identify the most visible signs of pollution, such as debris, water discoloration, odors, surface films and sheens, fish kills, and algal blooms. Volunteers also sample water and test for nutrients, such as phosphorus and chlorine. A volunteer scientist can sometimes be the first line of defense against pollution in our waterways&mdash;seeing the warning signs firsthand and alerting coordinators, emergency responders, and the PA Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP).</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of the gathering was to explore ways that citizen scientists can transform their data and water testing experiences into policy action and change.&nbsp;</strong>We partnered with Gayle Killam, Deputy Director of Science and Policy at River Network, Lindsay Blanton, Water Programs Coordinator for Wissahickon Valley Watershed Association, and Kevin Roth, Stewardship Assistant for Pennypack Ecological Restoration Trust, to discuss how data and personal stories can make a difference for our waterways through participating at regulatory hearings, commenting on permits, and advocating for stronger legislative protections.</p>

<p><strong>There are many avenues you can take to protect our waterways, too. For instance, when you find pollution in your creek, you can take immediate action by calling the PA DEP &ldquo;Emergencies and Spills Hotline&rdquo; (1-800-541-2050). </strong>When pollution causes a fish kill, for example, your advocacy and knowledge can help raise awareness about it and resolve the problem through stronger regulations and more effective policies.&nbsp;</p>

Saving Energy on a Budget,7/30/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Veronica Manning, PennFuture Intern</strong></em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to save energy on a budget with a few practical, simple steps. Here are some easy, cost-effective ways to decrease your home&rsquo;s carbon footprint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Switch to Clean Energy for Your Electricity</strong></p>

<p>Switching to a clean energy provider for your electricity is a simple alternative that allows you to rely less on fossil fuels. Pennsylvania is one of 17 states with a retail electric program, which lets customers choose where they buy their electricity.&nbsp;Using renewable energy doesn&rsquo;t require changing your utility company. In Pennsylvania,&nbsp;electricity utility companies own the distribution networks in a local area, or the wires that connect your house to the rest of the grid. The utility companies buy energy from a mix of sources, and that energy is then sent to their customers. Customers who have not chosen an electricity generator receive default electricity service, or energy that comes from multiple generators.&nbsp;Choosing your generation provider means that your same utility company will now send energy from your specified source instead of providing default electricity service to your home. Depending on what source you choose, this clean energy also may also be cheaper than what you currently pay for default electricity.</p>

<p>Switching to a clean energy provider can be done online in a few minutes. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/TakethePowerBack_Steps-to-Take-for-Parents.pdf""><strong>Follow our step-by-step guide here to get started.&nbsp;</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Reduce Your Standby Power Consumption</strong></p>

<p>Standby power is a term for the energy used by devices that appear to be off. Electronics like TVs, phone and laptop chargers, streaming devices, and gaming consuls all consume a small amount of power while in sleep mode. The Department of Energy estimates that standby power accounts for up to 10 percent&nbsp;of the total residential energy use in the U.S.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While standby power is necessary for the functioning of many appliances in your home, you can still reduce your standby power consumption by turning off nonessential devices when not in use.&nbsp;Your electronics can either be unplugged individually or grouped on a shared power strip. Some smart power strips also have an option to set a timer, automatically turning off your devices for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to spend more, you can also consider replacing your appliances with more efficient models. Older appliances consume more standby power than their newer counterparts.&nbsp; When shopping, look for models with an <a href=""https://www.energystar.gov/"">ENERGY STAR</a> certification. These products meet EPA guidelines for appliances that are both energy efficient and cost-effective in the long term. You also have the option of switching to a programmable thermostat.&nbsp; The EPA found that replacing a manual thermostat can cut heating or cooling costs by 20 percent or more.</p>

<p>For more information on standby power, <a href=""https://standby.lbl.gov/faq/#what"">check out this fact sheet from the Berkley Lab.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><strong>Use LED Lightbulbs</strong></p>

<p>If you are still using incandescent lightbulbs, consider switching to LEDs. Incandescent lightbulbs lose about 90 percent of the energy they consume as heat. Because so much energy is wasted, an incandescent bulb requires more energy to produce the same amount of light as an LED.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Light-emitting diodes, or LED bulbs, lose about 10 percent of the energy they consume as heat, making them much more efficient than their incandescent counterparts. They are more expensive than traditional lightbulbs, but last about 10 years. LEDs are also easy to dispose of once they have reached the end of their lifespan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While compact fluorescent light bulbs, or CFLs, are sometimes also listed as another energy-efficient alternative to incandescent bulbs, they are much less efficient than LEDs. CFLS lose about 80 percent of the energy they consume as heat. CFLs also contain mercury and need to be specially recycled to prevent contamination. If you have CFL bulbs in your home, you should replace them with LEDs once they burn out or break. Your local waste collection service and some stores may offer cheap or free CFL recycling. Check online to see what&rsquo;s available in your area. The EPA has also released guidelines for cleanup and disposal of broken CFL bulbs, <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/cfl"">which can be found here.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><strong>Line Dry Your Laundry</strong></p>

<p>Electric tumble dryers are one of the biggest consumers of energy in many households. In 2014, the <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/efficient-clothes-dryers-IB.pdf"">National Resource Defense Council</a> found that the typical electric dryer had seen only marginal improvements in energy efficiency since&nbsp; 1981. As of 2015, ENERGY STAR certified dryers are available, but these machines still consume large amounts of energy compared to other energy-efficient appliances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Line drying your laundry is a great way to reduce the energy consumed by drying clothes in an electric tumble drier. Sheets, blouses, dress shirts, and other items made of medium to lightweight fabric can be dried outdoors on a line. If line drying is not an option in your area, consider investing in an indoor drying rack for items like sweaters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Use Window Coverings to Keep Your Home at a Comfortable Temperature</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Using window coverings will reduce energy loss and save money on your heating and cooling bills. Heating energy can escape through your windows and decrease your home&rsquo;s energy efficiency.&nbsp; Uncovered windows also allow heat from sunlight to enter your home, making it harder to stay cool in the warmer months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you already have coverings on your windows, use them strategically to improve your energy efficiency. Window coverings should be opened on sunny winter mornings to allow heat from sunlight to enter your home throughout the day. Coverings should be closed on summer days to reduce heat from direct sunlight. Windows that do not receive direct sunlight can be left uncovered to take advantage of natural light.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you do not&nbsp; already have coverings on all of your windows, <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/energy-efficient-window-attachments"">use this guide from the Department of Energy</a> to find which type would work best for you.&nbsp;</p>

Engaging on Environmental Concerns and Listening across the State: Meet the CEO Happy Hours,7/27/2018,"<p>This spring, PennFuture kicked off a series of Meet the CEO Happy Hour events around the state, as we wanted to create opportunities for me to meet more of our supporters, activists and partners spread all around this very large Commonwealth.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>More importantly, we wanted to create a chance for all of you, as our eyes and ears on the ground, to talk with me, share your concerns and meet other members of our talented PennFuture staff. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this time a lot, and now I feel much more plugged into a community of people who care deeply about our environment, and who are doing remarkable work to protect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the 2016 elections, PennFuture made a conscious decision to be more active in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s mid-sized towns and communities. Our happy hours are a part of that endeavor, and now have taken us to Erie, Ambler, State College, Mount Pocono, and of course Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where I tend to spend a lot of time already.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve learned quite a bit more about the concerns of folks living in these places and I wanted to share some of what I have heard with all of you.</p>

<p><strong>One of our best attended events was held in Erie, where I reconnected with several activists who shared their concerns about Erie Coke Works.</strong>&nbsp;While we are not ready to make specific pronouncements about pollution from the facility, the community may be dealing with significant pollution problems, based on the odors and visible emissions coming from the works.&nbsp; There were conversations about the Lake Erie and French Creek and about renewable energy opportunities, and threats from pipelines and plastics.&nbsp; We had a chance to meet a large group of senior academics and administrators from Gannon University, who were not there for the happy hour, but with whom a lot of synergy is now evident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In Pittsburgh, there was a lot of talk about air quality, fracking and the petrochemical build-out underway and led by Shell Global in nearby Beaver County.</strong>&nbsp;I connected with some old friends from the nine years I spent living and working in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; For as much time spent talking over the challenges, there was good talk about renewable energy over microbrews. PennFuture has had a presence in Pittsburgh since its beginning, and so many of you who came out have had long relationships with our organization.</p>

<p><strong>Up in the Poconos, we had a fantastic turnout and we saw friends from close partners like Brodhead Watershed Association and Trout Unlimited.</strong>&nbsp;PennFuture&rsquo;s office in Mount Pocono is focused on protecting those high quality headwater streams of the Delaware River Basin, and so there was a lot of talk about Exceptional Value streams, and how they must continue to be protected, while at the same time allowing for economic development to flourish. We had a group from the Wind Gap area come to talk to us about sludge disposal and their work to protect their community.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In Ambler, I had a chance to meet Mayor Jeanne Sorg, and talk about Ambler&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability, including clean energy.</strong>&nbsp;My conversation with Mayor Sorg gave me some food for thought as PennFuture looks to expand its Clean Energy Communities project beyond Pittsburgh.&nbsp; Mayor Sorg reminded me that as clean water and clean energy are intrinsic to healthy, thriving communities, the bottom line for elected officials is managing a budget and how important it will be that green solutions and practices are positively impacting those bottom lines.&nbsp; Wissahickon Valley Watershed Association staff showed up in numbers for some socializing, and several important local activists came out to support the event.</p>

<p><strong>Renowned Penn State climate scientist and PennFuture board member Michael Mann joined us in State College, and there was a lot of talk about climate and politics and how we can tackle the lack of leadership among most elected officials on our issues.</strong>&nbsp;I had a chance to reconnect with a woman who shares my name, almost 30 years after we found out the other existed on a bus trip to Washington, D.C. for a rally after the Three Mile Island disaster.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not of blood relation, but she and others who came out for the happy hour share the same DNA for environmental advocacy.</p>

<p><strong>We also had a crowd at the new Yards Brewery in Philadelphia, a business we love because of their commitment to renewable energy.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>By far, the biggest question we heard over and over was, &ldquo;What can I do to help?&rdquo;</strong> There&rsquo;s so much you can do.&nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in past blogs, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/greenin18"" target=""_blank"">our Green in &rsquo;18 campaign is seeking volunteers through the fall.</a>&nbsp;Our <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/join-the-ace-program"" target=""_blank"">Advocates for Conservation and the Environment (ACE) program</a> is training volunteers to do education on issues and meetings with legislators in district offices. That program is slowly expanding and we&rsquo;d welcome your help. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/newsletter-sign-up"" target=""_blank"">We also ask that you subscribe to our email list</a>, as your engagement and rapid response to action alerts will allow you to contact your legislators and push them on specific actions when in session, and we will always keep you up to date on the latest environmental legislation moving in Harrisburg.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who attended, just to say hello, or to bring important issues to our attention.&nbsp;While PennFuture does not have the capacity to work on every environmental issue in the state, we have&nbsp;concerns after several of these conversations and will be looking into next steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We need you to be our eyes and ears on the ground because our state is large and we cannot be everywhere &ndash; as much as we would like to be.&nbsp;In the meantime, we count on you.&nbsp;I want to thank all of the PennFuture board members and President&rsquo;s Leadership Council members, and ACE volunteers who have joined us thus far. Thanks to the staff who came out, and brought&nbsp;their family members, and significant others with them. I hope to see more of you at future happy hours that are on our calendar for the rest of the summer into spring.</p>

Why You Should Join Tom Wolf & Scott Wagner on the Campaign Trail,7/27/2018,"<div>The threats to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment have never been more urgent. We have the third worst air quality in the country, and as a result, in some Pennsylvania cities, one in three children suffers from asthma. Pennsylvania drinking water ranks as one the nation&#39;s riskiest for lead-contamination, and 19,000 miles of our streams and rivers are unsafe for drinking, recreation, aquatic life, or agricultural use. The race to exploit the abundance of natural gas beneath the surface has turned Pennsylvania into one of the largest producers of methane, a major health and climate hazard, and has produced large quantities of wastewater and solid waste, which has exposed Pennsylvanians to harmful substances that cause a variety of serious illnesses.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In response, a coalition of 26 environmental organizations across the state, led by PennFuture, developed the <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/CCA_2nd-Edition_Web-Version-6.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda</strong></a>, a comprehensive series of fiscally responsible solutions to the problems above. Another advantage of the agenda: the recommended solutions can be enacted by the incoming governor using the executive authority granted in the state constitution. With a pivotal gubernatorial election taking place on November 6, this would seem like an opportune time to distribute the agenda. But so far, we&#39;ve heard little about either candidate&rsquo;s environmental and conservation agendas.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Why are the candidates focusing so little attention on the environment? After all, aren&rsquo;t more and more people convinced that the environmental problems facing Pennsylvania must be addressed before it&rsquo;s too late? The answer to the latter question is a resounding &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; The <a href=""https://www.fandm.edu/uploads/files/708725106986767486-f-m-poll-release-march-2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"">March 2018 Franklin and Marshall College Poll</a> survey of 423 Pennsylvania registered voters found that 62% think climate change is causing problems now, and 67% think the state should do more to address the problems associated with climate change, including 47% who say the state should definitely do more. What&rsquo;s more, 55% of the respondents believe the potential environmental risks of natural gas drilling outweigh the potential economic benefits, a turnaround of the findings in a Franklin &amp; Marshall survey four years earlier.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Yet despite these findings, only 2% of the participants in the March 2018 poll believe that the environment is the most important problem facing the state, a sentiment that is essentially the same as in other recent Franklin &amp; Marshal polls. The top five concerns expressed by Pennsylvania voters in March were:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Government &amp; politicians<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>16%</li>
	<li>Taxes<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>15%</li>
	<li>Unemployment &amp; personal finances<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>12%</li>
	<li>Crime, drugs, violence, and guns<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>10%</li>
	<li>Education/schools<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>9%</li>
</ul>

<div>These five problems have been at the top of the list dating back to early 2017, while the environment has ranked no higher than seventh during this time period and has not been mentioned by more than 3% of Franklin &amp; Marshall poll participants. So, although Pennsylvania voters are concerned about the environment and want to see more action taken, they consider other issues even more important. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that the issues overshadowing the environment are the ones being discussed on the campaign trail. I can personally attest to that having attended a Scott Wagner town hall last week.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>To overcome this, the PA Common Conservation Agenda coalition <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/greenin18"" target=""_blank"">created the Green in &rsquo;18 campaign.</a> To advance the agenda, it is vital that both gubernatorial candidates start discussing environmental issues on the campaign trail and presenting their plans for restoring the health of the state&rsquo;s environment and safeguarding it for future generations. The only way this will happen is if the Green in &rsquo;18 campaign can elevate the importance of the environment in voters&rsquo; minds, and motivate them to get out on the campaign trail and ask the candidates questions about their positions on and plans for the environment.&nbsp;</div>

PennFuture Joins Forces with Franklin County Coalition for Progress for Presentation,7/27/2018,"<p>On Saturday, July 14, PennFuture provided a presentation on &quot;Climate, Stewardship, and Environmental Justice&quot; at the Coyle Free Library in Chambersburg, Pa. as dozens of activists came out to discuss and learn more about a variety of environmental issues hindering our Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture was invited to present and participate in the event by Franklin County Coalition for Progress (FCCP), a local advocacy group advancing social justice and equality for all residents in Franklin County. Topics ranged from federal and state policy, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s standing in the Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP), and environmental justice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had the honor of joining my colleagues, Ezra Thrush, Director of Policy, and Roman Acri, Green in 18&rsquo; south-central Pennsylvania campaign organizer, on a variety of conversations with the attendees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ezra began the event by highlighting several essential pieces of work he has been a part of. It has been a busy legislative season for our Director of Policy, and the impact of it has been felt across the board by those in the conservation effort and beyond. Highlighting the positive and negative aspects of the House and Senate Farm Bills, as well as increased funding for our environmental agencies, he informed the coalition that much has been accomplished &ndash; yet much more work still needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My work primarily revolves around the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers, specifically the cleanup and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. On April 10, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental advocates and state agencies conducted a meeting where they developed their toolbox for four pilot counties that will be heading up the initial strategy of reducing pollution and runoff, and developing best management practices (BMP&rsquo;s) to help Pennsylvania reach its Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Pennsylvania being so far behind in its pollution reduction goals, I highlighted some of the most important areas of work that are taking place at the state and county levels. Being in Franklin County, which is one of the four pilot counties of the WIP pilot program, Chambersburg plays a critical role in the progress of our pollution reduction goals. With their state-of-the art MS4 program, this small town is making big progress and setting a great example for the south central part of the state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roman then closed out the session talking about Environmental Justice in the state. According to the PA Department of Environmental Protection, nearly one-third of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s population lives in an Environmental Justice area. These areas are now defined as a census block group with a 30 percent or greater minority population, or a 20 percent or greater population at or below the poverty level. &ldquo;These are really important issues that are severely harming entire communities &ndash; solely because of where they live,&rdquo; Roman said. &ldquo;We have a responsibility not only as advocates, but as human beings, to look out for each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PennFuture would like to thank the Franklin County Coalition for Progress for allowing us to speak at their meeting. Any time environmental advocates are able to come together, enjoy some coffee, and discuss environmental protections is a good day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>FCCP is leading the way to a renewal of the promise of America; that Franklin County becomes a community of welcome, acceptance, fairness, and opportunity for all people. They hold monthly seminars on the second Saturday of every month from 10am-12pm at the Coyle Free Library in Chambersburg. The next few months will continue the focus of watershed health, specifically examining the Borough of Chambersburg storm water sewer systems.

Cloudy with a 100% Chance of Solar Power Generation,7/17/2018,"<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/PennFuture%2D1%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 700px; height: 726px;"" /></p>

<p>Bob and Susan Donnan have always had an appreciation for the environment, and after choosing to go solar at their home in Peters Township, common misconceptions about installing solar panels in Western Pennsylvania were quickly shattered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was surprised by how much energy could be stored on cloudy or partly cloudy days,&rdquo; Susan said. &ldquo;People think it has to be sunny all of the time and that is a misconception.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The couple attended PennFuture&rsquo;s Annual Pittsburgh Solar Tour in October 2017. Just a couple of weeks later during a trip to Home Depot, Bob spoke to representatives from Solar City, made an appointment for a free estimate, and made the switch to solar energy.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The couple&rsquo;s passion for clean energy stems from their shared desire to create a better world for future generations, especially their own family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My greatest concern is the environment I am leaving for my grandchildren. I worry about the future and I feel many people are concerned with profit and making money. I am concerned for my grandkids,&rdquo; Susan said.</p>

<p>Susan, a volunteer with Face2Face Healing, and Bob, a retired landscaper, live in a home that now has 11 solar panels that are then backed up by a Tesla power wall. The panels are a 3.3 kilowatt system. The Tesla power wall is a rated 14 kilowatt hour lithium ion battery, of which 13.5 kilowatts are useable. The panels supply the house with energy, and any excess power produced by the solar panels is then stored in the power wall. This is helpful because it gives the home energy independence in the event that the grid goes down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been days when we put energy back on the grid, which is a good feeling,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;Today, we were 97% self-powered. Yesterday, we were 100% self-powered and for the week, we have been 86% self-powered. This month, our home has been 72% self-powered.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The combination of attending PennFuture&rsquo;s Pittsburgh Solar Tour and then bumping into Solar City workers around the same time period spurred their choice to go solar.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;While on the tour, I learned more about the orientation of the panels and got a better idea of what the production would do for those families and households,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;We learned about the SRECS and renewable credits. It just gave you a feel for seeing it up close and talking to someone about it, and hearing about their commitment, interest and their knowledge. Everyone was enthusiastic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They also liked the fact that many of the homes were right in their neighborhood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It came out to our local area and that made it more interesting to us,&rdquo; Bob said. &ldquo;These were areas I was familiar with and one place I drive past often. There was a nice group of people on the bus and snacks &ndash; you always remember the food.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Bob and Susan encourage those interested to attend PennFuture&rsquo;s Pittsburgh Solar Tour Oct. 6, 2018 to get an idea of the clean energy possibilities for their own families and homes.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;They can get a firsthand look for themselves, talk through how it works for them and be pretty specific, getting a close-up look at panels on a roof, learning about a power wall, how it works and what it does,&rdquo; Bob said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout the process, the couple has discovered the power of going solar and the possibilities it can bring, even if it&rsquo;s a typically dreary Pittsburgh day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think if I have learned something, it&rsquo;s that I am kind of surprised to see that the panels still produce even after the sun goes over the house in the late afternoon and into the evening. We still get production. The panels produce energy for a lot longer period every day than I thought they would &ndash; it is surprising even on a grey, cloudy day, you still get production,&rdquo; he said.</p>

RESPECTAgZone Aims to Protect Community from Intrusive Proposed Power Lines Route,6/27/2018,"<div><em><strong>By Susan Cenname, RESPECTAgZone Member and Indiana Township Resident</strong></em></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>For the past year, residents of Indiana Township, adjacent to Hartwood Acres County Park, have been under a threat that would change their way of life, the appearance of their community, the value of their homes, and the safety of their land. The threat has been unnecessary on many levels, and yet it persists.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Residents first learned of the threat from a benign-appearing notice that began, &ldquo;Dear Duquesne Light Customer: As new homes are being built and the demand for energy grows in the area, Duquesne Light Company [DLC] is working to maintain a level of reliability customers have come to expect while increasing the overall resiliency of the grid. Our dedication to improving the way energy is delivered is just one of the many ways we are working to become your next generation energy company.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>It went on to describe the company&rsquo;s plans to build a new high-voltage transmission line through Indiana Township to service West Deer Municipality. The notices did not contain any maps of the routes being considered by the company.&nbsp; The description of the project failed to vividly reflect the dramatic impact 150-foot high towers would have on our environment, working farms, and landscape.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This notice initiated a process by which residents educated themselves about DLC, their project, its alternatives, and the approvals needed before it could happen. The notice also spurred community members to organize around the issue into a cohesive voice that would be heard by DLC and other decision-makers.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>The Project:</strong> DLC is proposing to construct a 128 kV high-power transmission line through Indiana Township to serve West Deer Municipality.&nbsp; The question is: how will DLC achieve that goal? DLC initially proposed three routes through Indiana Township. DLC&rsquo;s proposal identified a &ldquo;preferred route,&rdquo; which passed next to Allegheny County&rsquo;s Hartwood Acres Park.&nbsp; All three routes initially proposed would cut through prime agricultural lands.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>The Common Sense Alternative: </strong>Through the work of a Township employee, local citizens identified a fourth alternative that would achieve DLC&rsquo;s goals without the social and environmental impacts of the initial alternatives.&nbsp; This route would hug the Turnpike for much of its path - thereby avoiding much of Indiana Township&rsquo;s prime agricultural lands and Hartwood Acres Park.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>That Turnpike Route, as we term it, has many win-win characteristics.&nbsp;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>It limits visual and environmental degradation to areas already impacted by the Turnpike itself;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>It can share some of the existing right-of-way belonging to the Turnpike, which reduces costs and impacts associated with right-of-way management;</li>
	<li>It provides greater engineering redundancy and resiliency to the electric grid&mdash;a stated project goal for DLC;</li>
	<li>It is supported by the PA Turnpike Commission; the PA Department of Agriculture, the PA Office Small Business Administration, and the local community; and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>It causes the least environmental and social impact of any of the alternatives being considered.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>The Process: </strong>As our group dug into this proposed project, we learned that DLC had to follow a specific process in order to obtain approval to implement it. Because DLC is a regulated electric service provider that has the authority to condemn private property, it must apply for approval and obtain the consent of the Public Utility Commission (PUC) before implementing the project. The cost of this project will be borne by DLC&rsquo;s customers, so DLC must first and foremost demonstrate a need for the project. After performing an environmental assessment of the alternatives, DLC must justify its choice of routes before the PUC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Because the PUC is a government entity, its decision, and by extension DLC&rsquo;s decision, must comply with Article I, Section 27 of the PA Constitution, known as the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA). The ERA requires government, when faced with equally practicable alternatives, to choose that which does not harm the fundamental constitutional rights granted citizens by Section 27, that is, the right to clean air, pure water, and the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>If this project is needed, we, the citizens of Indiana Township who have organized as RespectAgZone, urge DLC to choose the most common sense alternative for its proposed high-voltage power line -- along the existing Pennsylvania Turnpike route.&nbsp; Only that route minimizes environmental and social costs while achieving the overall benefits proposed for the project. RespectAgZone is pleased to have the assistance of and be represented in this matter by PennFuture, which we were glad to learn recently won an important land use decision before the PA Supreme Court, and which has substantial experience before the PUC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We look forward to the day when DLC removes the constant threat of this proposed project and does the right thing by prioritizing the long-term natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic values of these beautiful lands so accessible to the citizens of the city of Pittsburgh.</div>

State Budget Headed in the Right Direction for Environment,6/26/2018,"<div>Governor Tom Wolf signed into law a $32.7 billion spending plan for the Fiscal Year 2018-19 Pennsylvania state budget (House Bill 2121). Compared to the long budget stalemates Pennsylvania has dealt with over the last few years, this appropriations bill made its way through the General Assembly on time and with modest increases in investment for environmental protection.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s FY2018-19 Budget &amp; the Environment</strong></div>

<div>It&rsquo;s important to put Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental investment budget in context first: our key state resource agencies and commissions are chronically underfunded, understaffed, and work with aging infrastructure. For almost two decades, Pennsylvania Governors and legislators &ndash; both Democrats and Republicans &ndash; cut environmental budgets even while ecological stressors like natural gas drilling and climate change were on the rise.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The FY2018-19 state budget does very little to reverse these decades of dismantling and it will take strong bipartisan leadership in Harrisburg to reverse this costly trend. Nonetheless, the state budget provides modest increases that allow the Commonwealth&rsquo;s resource agencies, such as the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to slightly increase capacity and not have to cut back programming.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In fact, unlike the last few years, no environmental agency or commission we work hard to advocate for saw spending cuts and some saw increases. It signals some hope that this budget indicates a floor to the cuts and a beginning to the long-road to building strong, well-financed and staffed environmental and conservation agencies that protect and advance public health and a sustainable economy.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Take a closer look at the FY2018-19 budget allocations (HB 2121):</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Department of Agriculture&nbsp;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>$1M increase from FY2017-18 for General Operations</li>
	<li>$3M increase from FY2017-18 for Spotted Lanternfly Control</li>
	<li>Overall, $7.49M increase for PDA from FY2017-18</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>$1.74M increase from FY2017-18 for General Operations (from Oil &amp; Gas Lease Fund)</li>
	<li>$5.16M increase from FY2017-18 for State Parks Operations (from Oil &amp; Gas Lease Fund)</li>
	<li>$6.52M increase from FY2017-18&nbsp; for State Forests Operations (from Oil &amp; Gas Lease Fund)</li>
	<li>$2.50M increase from FY2017-18 for Parks &amp; Forests Infrastructure</li>
	<li>Overall, $16.1M increase for DCNR from FY2017-18</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Department of Environmental Protection&nbsp;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>$1.07M increase from FY2017-18&nbsp; for General Operations</li>
	<li>$1.52M increase from FY2017-18&nbsp; for Environmental Program Management</li>
	<li>$3.98M increase from FY2017-18&nbsp; for Environmental Protection Operations</li>
	<li>$135K increase from FY2017-18&nbsp; for Chesapeake Bay Agricultural Source Abatement</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18&nbsp; for DRBC (Delaware River Basin) - $217K</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18&nbsp; for SRBC (Susquehanna River Basin) - $237K</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18&nbsp; for ICPRB (Potomac River Basin) - $23K</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18&nbsp; for ORSANCO (Ohio River Basin) - $68K</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18&nbsp; for Chesapeake Bay Commission - $275K</li>
	<li>No change from FY2017-18&nbsp; for Conservation District Fund - $2.5M</li>
	<li>Overall, $6.84M increase for DEP from FY2017-18</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Fiscal Code Bill Makes Few Environmental Changes</strong></div>

<div>In addition to the appropriations bill, the legislature often passes associated &ldquo;code bills&rdquo; that implement the budget across different issues areas. These code bills are often used to move nefarious pieces of legislation that by themselves wouldn&rsquo;t make it through the legislature. For this budget, legislators passed a Fiscal Code, which implements the state budget (House Bill 1929) that only included a few environmental and conservation provisions, including:&nbsp;</div>

<ul>
	<li>Transferred $30.4 million dollars from the Volkswagen (VW) settlement to the General Fund. These funds were provided to Pennsylvania from a settlement that found VW defrauded owners of low-emissions vehicles, resulting in more pollution. These dollars are supposed to be used by the state to reduce air pollution, but the legislature is diverting those funds to balance the budget instead;</li>
	<li>Established a state financial fund to help owners of private dams satisfy financial responsibility obligations under the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act, administered by the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP);</li>
	<li>Allocated $14.5 million in funding through the Commonwealth Financing Authority (CFA) for small water and sewer projects around the Commonwealth;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mandated that the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) open and create various ATV trails in northcentral Pennsylvania.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Looking Ahead Through 2018</strong></div>

<div>With the state budget wrapped up on time, the legislature will make themselves scarce in Harrisburg between now and the November elections. A number of big issues are still on the table, including threatened closures of uneconomic nuclear power plants, unsafe pipelines under construction impacting local communities, implementing the state&rsquo;s new building codes, passing community solar legislation, and updating the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS). Furthermore, factions within the legislature are still interested in advancing regulatory rollbacks and dismantling state environmental protections. It&rsquo;s possible these issues may crop up through the end of this year and PennFuture will keep an eye out, particularly in a lame duck session after the elections.</div>

<div>Over 86,000 Pennsylvanians work in clean energy jobs, <a href=""https://www.e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Clean-Jobs-Pennsylvania-2018.pdf"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>according to a report released June 19</strong></u></a>, by the national nonpartisan business group <a href=""https://www.e2.org/"" target=""_blank"">E2</a> and partner organizations &mdash; Green Building Alliance, Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance, Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia, and Sustainable Pittsburgh.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The exact number of jobs is 86,285, and includes jobs in renewable energy (solar and wind), energy efficiency, clean vehicles, battery storage, advanced biofuels, low-impact hydro, and other areas. The surge in clean energy jobs is not confined to one or two regions of the state; there are residents in every county&nbsp;working in these fields.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The report also shows that Pennsylvania ranks 11th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the number of clean energy jobs. Sounds pretty good, right? Well, not exactly.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Pennsylvania is the 5th largest state in terms of population according to the <a href=""https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/state-total.html"">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, yet ranks 11th in clean energy jobs. </strong>In contrast, Massachusetts, which has about half the population of Pennsylvania (15th overall), has the 7th highest total of clean energy jobs. Virginia, which ranks 12th in population, has the 10th most clean energy jobs.

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The private sector is the engine of job growth, but there is much state government can and must do to rev up this engine. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/CCA_2nd-Edition_Web-Version-6.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>The PA Common Conservation Agenda, a blueprint for environmental action developed by PennFuture</strong></u></a> and 25 other environmental groups across Pennsylvania &ndash; including three that helped produce the E2 jobs report, Green Building Alliance, Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia, and Sustainable Pittsburgh &ndash; contains a number practical, fiscally responsible steps that can be enacted by whoever occupies the governor&rsquo;s office after the 2018 election, simply using his executive authority. <strong>Among the recommendations in the agenda pertaining to creating more clean energy jobs:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Invest in workforce training programs that provide displaced workers and new workforce entrants with skills in clean technology areas, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean transportation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Grow the state&rsquo;s green business sector by participating in recruitment trips to the top companies around the country to advocate for expansion or relocation to the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Instruct the Department of Community and Economic Development&rsquo;s Manufacturing PA initiative to focus on workforce development and job opportunities in clean energy manufacturing.</li>
	<li>Expand the Department of Labor and Industry&rsquo;s Apprenticeship and Training Office to focus on clean energy trades.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Develop an in-depth economic plan in concert with strong clean energy policies that includes opportunities for displaced workers, openings for a diverse workforce, considerations for rural and vulnerable communities, and innovative workforce investments.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Offer active public support and leadership to help pass the Congressional RECLAIM Act, a bipartisan bill, which would allocate funds to reclamation and restoration of land and water resources adversely affected by coal mining, providing Pennsylvania with $67 million annually for five years.</li>
</ul>

<div>Additionally, hundreds of millions of dollars in Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority funding are available to invest in the Commonwealth&rsquo;s clean water infrastructure. With our water sector facing an aging workforce, leadership from the governor&#39;s office could help attract job-seekers, and support hiring and recruiting the next generation of clean water professionals.</div>

Meet Kelsey Krepps: PennFuture's New Western PA Outreach Coordinator,6/25/2018,"<p>Hey there! My name is Kelsey Krepps, and I am so excited to be back in my home state of Pennsylvania <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/kelsey-krepps"" target=""_blank"">working for an organization that cares so deeply for the issues near and dear to my heart.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>When I was a child, I thought being green and helping the environment was all about cleaning it up. My babysitter would take my sister and I on walks to our local ice cream stand just a half mile up the road, and on the way, we&rsquo;d pick up all the trash. I loved seeing my handiwork and knowing that I was responsible for making the world just a little bit better. As junior high and high school passed, I participated in numerous clean ups and tree plantings all over Crawford, Venango, and Erie Counties. I loved that these events were a part of my school curriculum, and I like to think of them as me leaving little green thumbprints everywhere I go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later, I went to the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford for my undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies &ndash; shocking, I know. One of the greatest things I learned there, though, was the role that environmental issues play in community development. Being green and helping the environment is not an environmental issue, it&rsquo;s a people issue. We don&rsquo;t get to have healthy, thriving communities when we don&rsquo;t live in a healthy, thriving environment. Our families and our health suffer when the environment suffers. Businesses suffer when the environment suffers. Being green is more than cleaning up, it&rsquo;s about preventing the clean ups from needing to happen in the first place. It&rsquo;s about having an active role in how we influence our homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I spent the last three years in Boone, North Carolina for graduate school. There, I studied renewable energies like wind and solar, but I also studied the history, natural resources and culture of the Appalachian Region. In Western PA, we have such diverse histories from coal mines in the Southwest to the industries of Pittsburgh to farming in the Northwest and eco-tourism, well, everywhere. I was raised in a farming community just ten minutes away from Titusville, PA &ndash; the birthplace of the oil industry. We can celebrate Pennsylvania&rsquo;s history in fossil fuels and industry while still choosing to create a cleaner, renewable future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can be both the clean up crew and the people who protect the policies in place that defend our health, homes, and families from big polluters. We can be both pro-job and pro-environment, creating just transitions for our fossil fuel imbedded neighborhoods. We can be leaders in renewable, clean energy. We can have cleaner air, water, and land. We can speak up about environmental injustice. We can love the communities we&rsquo;re from, while knowing there&rsquo;s still work to be done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I look forward to meeting you and working with those of you in Western PA and beyond for a more sustainable Pennsylvania. Please feel free to contact me at krepps@pennfuture.org or call me at 412-224&ndash;4477.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture Secures Victory for Homeowners in PA Supreme Court Case,6/25/2018,"<p>The PA State Supreme Court announced its long-awaited decision&nbsp;in Gorsline et al. v. Board of Supervisors of Fairfield Township v. Inflection Energy LLC et al., earlier this month, which completes a multi-year journey between PennFuture and its clients, Brian and Dawn Gorsline, and their neighbors, Paul and Michele Batkowski.</p>

<p>PennFuture began representing the Gorslines and Batkowskis in January 2014, when its lawyers appealed a decision by Fairfield Township to issue Inflection Energy a conditional use permit for operation of a shale gas well pad in the residential portion of the municipality&rsquo;s R-A (Residential-Agricultural) zoning district.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To issue the permit, the Township&rsquo;s ordinance required that it conclude that an industrial shale gas well pad was &ldquo;similar to and compatible with&rdquo; other uses allowed in the R-A district. The appeal focused on the company&rsquo;s failure to meet that standard, and that issuing the permit violated our clients&rsquo; constitutional rights.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The appeal was heard in the Lycoming Court of Common Pleas by Judge Marc F. Lovecchio, who sided with PennFuture and overturned the Township&rsquo;s decision.&nbsp; Recognizing that there were important constitutional issues at play, Judge Lovecchio concluded that Inflection had failed to put on adequate evidence at the local hearing to justify issuance of the permit.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Township and Inflection appealed that ruling to the Commonwealth Court.&nbsp;The Commonwealth Court held that the Township was justified in issuing the permit because the ordinance allows &ldquo;public service facilities&rdquo; in all of its zoned districts, and an industrial shale gas well pad was similar to a &ldquo;public service facility.&rdquo; The Court had previously used this rationale in another case to allow a compressor station to be located in a light industrial zoned district.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This case, then, if allowed to stand, would have constituted an outrageous expansion of this rationale that would have swallowed any need for townships to affirmatively regulate where shale gas development would be allowed.</strong> Instead of fulfilling the township&rsquo;s obligations under Article I, Section 27 in choosing where to locate all of the various impacts associated with this vast industry, townships would have been free to issue ad hoc approvals for well pads, processing plants and compressor stations in any of its zoned districts under the ruse that the land use was similar to a &ldquo;public service facility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PennFuture appealed and the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s decision went to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.&nbsp;In its appeal, PennFuture argued that there were four different ways in which the Commonwealth Court made the wrong decision, including that the decision violated Article I, Section 27 of the Constitution and our clients&#39; substantive due process rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Supreme Court did not decide the case on the broader constitutional arguments that we made, but did agree with our other three arguments.&nbsp;</strong>The Court held that:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Shale gas development is an industrial land use, and that this industrial land use is not the same as a public service facility;</li>
	<li>Industrial shale gas well pads are not &ldquo;in any material respect&rdquo; similar to and compatible with the other permitted uses in the Township&rsquo;s R-A District;</li>
	<li>The Township could not rely on its earlier decisions to allow shale gas development in its R-A District in order to justify issuance of this permit.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Even though the Court did not decide the case on constitutional bases, the decision established a number of important points.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The Court firmly characterized shale gas development as an industrial land use while rejecting industry&rsquo;s fiction that after construction of the well pads, the facilities have no ongoing impact on public health and the environment.</li>
	<li>The Court rejected the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s finding that shale gas well pads are similar and compatible with &ldquo;public service&rdquo; facilities. The Court recognized that shale gas is a private enterprise that does not directly provide any public service to area residents. This establishes important precedent that precludes townships from using &ldquo;public service facility&rdquo; provisions in existing zoning ordinances for permitting shale gas well pads.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Court stated that shale gas development was not materially similar in any manner to other permitted uses in Fairfield Township&rsquo;s R-A District.&nbsp;This finding was very important, because even though the Court did not expressly decide the case on constitutional grounds, the finding has important constitutional implications.&nbsp;When exercising its zoning powers, local government takes away, to one degree or another, private property owners&rsquo; rights to do with their property whatever they choose, and they do that without paying for the taking of those rights. For government to exercise that power constitutionally, the Supreme Court has said that property owners must also benefit from the existence of zoning districts, and that requires that only similar and compatible uses be allowed in each zoned district.&nbsp;Consequently, when zoning for shale gas development, townships must determine and justify what other land uses are similar and compatible with this particular industrial land use. To the extent shale gas development is not similar and compatible with other uses in a particular zoned district, the municipality cannot constitutionally allow shale gas development to occur in the same zoned district.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Finally, the Court&rsquo;s ruling effectively requires that townships make conscious decisions, with public participation, about how this industry will be regulated on the local level.&nbsp;</strong>It is not adequate to, as did Fairfield Township, permit industrialization of a zoned township on an ad hoc basis.&nbsp; The township must make reasoned decisions that take into account the expectations of its citizenry about the type of land uses that will be allowed in particular zoned districts, and, in the end, those decisions must comport with the state and federal Constitutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s success in this case is not just a long-awaited win for our clients, but a win for concerned residents across the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

Opinion: Wolf and Wagner need to be specific in plans to help the environment,6/7/2018,"<p><em><strong>This blog post originally <a href=""http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2018/05/wolf_and_wagner_need_to_be_spe.html"" target=""_blank"">appeared in PennLive</a> on May 30, 2018.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong><em>By Jan Jarrett</em></strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania&#39;s public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.&quot;</em></p>

<p>This coming Jan. 15, either Tom Wolf or Scott Wagner will raise his hand and take a binding oath to uphold the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>

<p>Among the duties the next governor will be obliged to carry out under its provisions is the protection of our air and water and the natural beauty of the Commonwealth as required by the Constitution&#39;s Environmental Rights Amendment.</p>

<p>Between now and Election Day, Nov. 6, both candidates need to tell Pennsylvanians how they intend to fulfill that legal responsibility.</p>

<p>The primary season has not given us much of a preview of either of the candidates&#39; environmental and conservation agendas.</p>

<p>Wagner&#39;s campaign website contains no mention of environmental policy except indirectly - he pledges to roll back &quot;overregulation.&quot;</p>

<p>His trash hauling company, Penn Waste, has incurred fines from at least 30 violations of environmental regulations. He has <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/31/scott-wagner/pa-gopers-climate-change-theory-debunked-nope-not-/"" target=""_blank"">publicly addressed climate change</a>, attributing it to the earth moving ever closer to the sun and the increasing body heat from a growing population.</p>

<p>Environmental policy took a back seat during Governor Wolf&#39;s first term. There were a few bright spots.</p>

<p>In the politically complex forum of the Delaware River Basin Commission, Wolf voted with the governors of Delaware and New York in favor of a resolution to place a permanent ban on fracking in the Delaware watershed.</p>

<p>He also signed bipartisan legislation that will put the Pennsylvania solar industry on an equal competitive footing with solar businesses in other states, a welcome recognition of the economic development potential of the clean energy sector.</p>

<p>But neither candidate has laid out anything near a vision or plan for how he will protect Pennsylvania&#39;s air and water now; and what he can do to conserve our natural resources for our grandchildren.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other governors have achieved landmark conservation and environmental protections.</p>

<p>The late Gov. Robert P Casey Sr.&#39;s administration successfully promoted one of the first significant investments in conservation with Key 93, a $100 million conservation bond and a permanent fund, the Keystone Recreation, Park and Conservation Fund, which gets its revenue from a portion of the real estate transfer tax.</p>

<p>Former Gov. Tom Ridge created Growing Greener, funded by a fee on garbage dumped at landfills, that provides grants to local organizations for conservation, watershed restoration and recreation projects</p>

<p>Ex-Gov. Ed Rendell signed the first legislation requiring energy suppliers to obtain 18 percent of their power from renewable and alternative energy supplies.</p>

<p>Rendell successfully campaigned for $625 Growing Greener II bond which was overwhelmingly approved by voters, and issued the $650 million Alternative Energy Investment bond, the largest bond for any purpose in state history.</p>

<p>The next governor faces a daunting list of environmental challenges.</p>

<p>The air in many parts of Pennsylvania is among the worse in the nation. We have thousands of miles of streams and rivers which do not support fish or provide clean drinking water.</p>

<p>The legacy of unregulated historic coal mining has left us with 180,000 acres of unproductive, dangerous and ugly polluted land that holds back economic development in coal communities. And Pennsylvania remains a major global source of the pollution that is disrupting the climate.</p>

<p>Neither Wolf nor Wagner will be able to adequately address these problems without a Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) that is fully staffed, adequately funded and independent of political pressure.</p>

<p>The Environmental Rights Amendment puts the responsibility of safeguarding our air, water and future environmental quality squarely at the doorstep of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Protection is the state agency charged with carrying out most of those responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The good news is that solutions to our environmental problems abound. Both candidates can find a comprehensive list of policy options in the <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/CCA_2nd-Edition_Web-Version-6.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda</strong></u></a> that contains ideas from 25 of the Commonwealth&#39;s environmental and conservation organizations.</p>

<p>Both candidates for governor will be bound by the Environmental Rights Amendment to protect our air and water and leave our grandchildren an environment that is at least as good as we now enjoy.</p>

<p>They owe the voters their plans for how they will carry out that duty.</p>

A New Strategy for Sparking Environmental Leadership in Pennsylvania,5/29/2018,"<div>I&rsquo;m sure many of you, like me, are thinking very hard these days about how to cross the divide between our personal views toward our planet&rsquo;s future, and those held by people with very different views. How can an issue like a safe and healthy environment be viewed as a special interest, when such an issue is in everyone&rsquo;s interest?&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>That&rsquo;s the question PennFuture and 25 of our colleague organizations took up this past winter as we sat down to craft the <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Updated-Final-Version-of-the-PA-Common-Conservation-Agenda-5.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda, </a>released this month. </strong>Our goal with the document was to first unite our diverse movement under the banner of the Common Agenda, a document that set forth a nonpartisan, pragmatic and achievable path forward to make real progress &ndash; and in a pretty short time period &ndash; toward clean air, pure water and a healthy climate, so our state can prosper and our economy thrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The second question we asked ourselves was, in addition to getting our diverse community to agree on a common agenda, what did the Common Agenda need to look like for the highest elected official in our state &ndash; our governor &ndash; to find his way into parts of it and provide the kind of leadership the people of Pennsylvania are asking for?&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Lastly, to the end of political leadership, we decided the platform for opportunity and influence was the upcoming campaign for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s governor and getting the candidates&rsquo; embrace of the agenda our aim. And so, to support the Common Agenda, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/greenin18"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>we have launched PennFuture&rsquo;s Green in &rsquo;18 campaign</strong></u></a>. More on that in a moment.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>The Common Agenda bears down on seven major points that we are asking the gubernatorial candidates to consider and act on:</strong></div>

<ol>
	<li>Strengthening the 21st century workforce through green jobs;</li>
	<li>Championing the great waters of Pennsylvania from source to tap;</li>
	<li>Providing the PA Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources with sufficient resources to fulfill their missions;</li>
	<li>Improving the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s ability to protect the public from the threats posed by natural gas and petrochemical infrastructure;</li>
	<li>Ensuring environment justice for vulnerable communities;</li>
	<li>Boosting current investments in the Growing Greener program, which protects our forests and farmland, restores watersheds and saves wildlife habitat; and</li>
	<li>Bolstering the state&rsquo;s clean energy sector.</li>
</ol>

Join the Second Annual Susquehanna River Rally in Harrisburg!,5/29/2018,"<p>Environmental organizations including National Parks Conservation Association, PennFuture, the Choose Clean Water Coalition, Sierra Club Pennslvania and the Susquehanna River Trails Association&nbsp;and activists are joining together for the Second Annual Susquehanna River Rally Saturday, June 9, to create a mass call for clean water funding as state budget negotiations commence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rally is calling for increased clean water funding as state budget talks begin to ramp up in the coming weeks in Harrisburg. In Pennsylvania, there is no dedicated fund for clean water, and the PA Department of Environmental Protection has had its budget slashed 40 percent over the last 15 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ensuring clean, safe drinking water is vital to all Pennsylvanians. Proposed cuts to existing funding streams that support the Susquehanna and its rivers and streams would be detrimental to families across the state,&rdquo; said Mariah Davis, Field Manager for the Choose Clean Water Coalition. &ldquo;Our aim is to empower environmental advocates and citizens through collective action so that their voices are heard, and our natural resources have improved protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Susquehanna River serves as a source of drinking water for nearly 6 million people, and this is our reminder to legislators that the health and vitality of our rivers is essential to both the health and economy of our Commonwealth. For too long, Pennsylvania has been lagging behind in our effort to clean up the Susquehanna River, which ultimately leads into the Chesapeake Bay, and our current status of the Phase III Watershed implementation Plan highlights these defects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amanda John Kimsey, the Pennsylvania and Delaware Program Manager for National Parks Conservation Association highlighted these sentiments: &ldquo;Despite its immense ecological, economic, historical and public health value, the Susquehanna River is impaired and many Pennsylvania legislators continue to work against its restoration. This incredible waterway offers us abundant recreation, brings water to our tap, and serves as an economic engine for communities along its banks. We look forward to joining arm in arm with river advocates at the 2018 Susquehanna River Rally to hold&nbsp;legislators accountable to protecting this important river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Please join us in supporting our natural resources and protecting our waterways!</p>

"Philadelphia’s Green City, Clean Waters Needs Funding to Achieve Goals",5/29/2018,"<p>Philadelphia is known as a leader when it comes to using rain gardens, tree trenches, and green roofs to reduce stormwater overflows that pollute local waterways.&nbsp;These practices and others, known as <strong>green stormwater infrastructure</strong>, allow water to naturally soak into soil or evaporate into the air without carrying pollutants into our streams and rivers. At the same time, they provide residents with cleaner air, more attractive parks and streets, and a healthier community.</p>

<p><strong>Philadelphia committed itself to accomplishing significant stormwater overflow reductions through a 25-year plan focused on green practices, known as the Green City, Clean Waters.</strong>&nbsp;In the first five years of the program, Philadelphia surpassed the expectations set for the program, creating over 800 &ldquo;greened acres&rdquo; across the city.&nbsp;Some of these projects have taken place on public property, such as the Mill Creek Playground where basketball courts were retrofitted with porous asphalt over an infiltration bed or Liberty Lands Park where a rain garden detention pond was installed to collect runoff from the site and an adjacent street.&nbsp;But from its beginning, Green City, Clean Waters contemplated the necessity of private development and investment in the success of the program.&nbsp;The Philadelphia Water Department has encouraged private investment in green stormwater infrastructure through regulatory changes&mdash;for example all new and/or redevelopment sites disturbing more than 15,000 square feet of earth must to infiltrate, retain, or treat the first inch of stormwater&mdash;as well as through grant incentive programs like the Stormwater Management Incentive Program (SMIP) and Greened Acre Retrofit Program (GARP).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These grant programs provide funding to private land owners and developers for the construction of stormwater retrofit projects on private property.&nbsp;This allows the Philadelphia Water Department to take compliance credit for greened acres on private project sites that would otherwise be inaccessible to the agency and at a cheaper price than it would cost the Philadelphia Water Department to build equivalent projects on public property.&nbsp;These programs are so successful that the Philadelphia Water Department is asking the Philadelphia Water, Sewer, and Stormwater Rate Board to increase the Department&rsquo;s budget for these programs.</p>

What the Volkswagen Settlement Means for PA,5/18/2018,"<p>Back in 2014, it was discovered that certain diesel Volkswagen vehicles met the required emissions standards during the official Federal Test Procedure, but produced almost 40 times the smog-forming oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), when driven on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, Volkswagen admitted to installing an illegal &ldquo;defeat device&rdquo; on 11 million vehicles that would deactivate the emissions controls when it sensed the car wasn&rsquo;t being tested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ensuing worldwide scandal resulted in a number of criminal charges and civil suits.&nbsp;In the U.S. alone, the company has agreed to pay around $20 billion in penalties and settlements.&nbsp;One part of these settlements is known as the &ldquo;Environmental Mitigation Trust.&rdquo;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s&nbsp; a pool of money intended to mitigate the damages from pollution caused by these vehicles.&nbsp;<a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Statement-New-State-Program-Will-Advance-Clean-Air-Projects"" target=""_blank""><strong>Out of that pool, Pennsylvania has been allocated a little over $118.5 million.</strong></a></p>

<p>This is not the same as the $30.4 million settlement Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced in March of 2017.&nbsp;While that was also intended to mitigate environmental damages, the Legislature -- through last year&rsquo;s fiscal code -- required that money be deposited in the General Fund, and it&rsquo;s not clear how that has benefited the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Environmental Mitigation Trust program works a bit differently.&nbsp;Here, the PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is the lead agency and they will review proposed projects, certify if they meet the conditions of the State Trust Agreement, and request funds for specific eligible projects.</p>

<p>The DEP has made its Beneficiary Mitigation Plan available online, but they have not yet announced that the program is open for applications.&nbsp;Still, it&rsquo;s not too early to start thinking about potential projects.&nbsp;<strong>Funding will be available for reducing emissions in the following ten categories:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Class 8 Local Trucks and Port Drayage Trucks</li>
	<li>Class 4-8 School Busses, Shuttle Busses, or Transit Busses</li>
	<li>Railroad Freight Switcher Locomotives</li>
	<li>Ferries/Tugs</li>
	<li>Ocean Going Vessels Shorepower</li>
	<li>Class 4-7 Local Freight Trucks</li>
	<li>Airport Ground Support Equipment</li>
	<li>Forklifts</li>
	<li>Light-Duty Zero Emission Vehicle Supply Equipment</li>
	<li>Matching funds for projects eligible under the Diesel Emission Reduction Act</li>
</ol>

<p>Within these categories, the DEP has said that &ldquo;consideration will be given to distributing project funding statewide, as appropriate, primarily based on the cost-effectiveness and the quantity of NOX emission reductions.&rdquo; While replacing fossil fuel engines with electric alternatives will probably result in the largest overall emissions reductions, this focus primarily on NOx emissions will mean that many of the funded projects could involve replacing or retrofitting diesel engines with natural gas engines.</p>

<p><strong>While there likely are cases where natural gas engines are the best available choice for a given application, PennFuture has encouraged the DEP to look beyond just the dollars per ton of NOx removed.</strong>&nbsp;Instead, we have asked that it puts more emphasis on projects that will build clean energy infrastructure or otherwise speed the market transformation to electric vehicles and other cleaner alternatives.&nbsp;This would be in keeping with the DEP&rsquo;s trust responsibility under Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Environmental Rights Amendment.</p>

<p>Hopefully, DEP will take this advice, but this likely isn&rsquo;t something it can make happen on their own.&nbsp;We need companies and individuals considering electric vehicles, EV infrastructure, or similar projects to apply for funding as soon as it becomes available.&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know how long this pool of money will last, but when it&rsquo;s gone so is the opportunity.</p>

Protect Your Forests: 2018 Farm Bill Update,5/16/2018,"<p>Sustainable agriculture, forestry, and clean water take center stage this week as the Farm Bill debates begin in the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Farm Bill is the largest federal source of conservation funding on private and public land. Over the past half-century, the Farm Bill has done much to support landowners and farmers in Pennsylvania who want to improve water quality and conserve wildlife habitat on their lands. The current Farm Bill&rsquo;s (Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2014) authorization expires at the end of September, and the legislation currently under consideration would provide funding through 2023.</p>

<p>The House is poised to push through and vote on the House version of the Farm Bill later this week. In what is typically a bipartisan effort to craft legislation to help our farmers, low-income communities, and conservation work every four years, <strong>this bill is ideological and harmful.</strong> It is problematic due to its cuts in protections and funding for the environment and conservation along with draconian work requirements for recipients of the SNAP program.</p>

<p><strong>The Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2) is replete with attacks on bedrock environmental laws and America&rsquo;s national forests.</strong> The House Farm Bill includes numerous categorical exemptions from public input and environmental review on forestry projects and incentivizes logging over clean water, recreation, and wildlife. Further, H.R. 2 undermines the National Environmental Policy Act.</p>

<p>The bill goes back on a long-sought-after and hard-won bipartisan fire funding compromise signed into law only a few months ago as a part of the Fiscal Year 2018 Omnibus Appropriations Act. This partisan, one-sided farm bill goes on to attack the Roadless Area Conservation Rule by creating a loophole that allows logging and costly road-building in protected and precious roadless forest areas, such as parts of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Allegheny National Forest in the northwest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>H.R. 2 also attacks the Endangered Species Act by removing a requirement for expert consultation regarding endangered species and critical habitat. We need the Forest Service to consider how water, soil, and wildlife are affected by large-scale projects &ndash; not cut back on protections and reviews to favor the industry. We must keep public lands in public hands. All Americans deserve a say in how these lands are managed, not just those out to make a buck.</p>

<p>As it stands, the House bill&rsquo;s conservation title is a solid start, but it could be stronger. We are pleased with the five million acre increase in the conservation reserve program, the increase in funding for the easement program and the continuation of the Regional Conservation Partnership Program. However, the bill cuts nearly $800 million from the conservation title over a ten-year period&mdash;this funding needs to be restored.</p>

<p><strong>Please ask your Member of Congress and Senators <a href=""https://www.casey.senate.gov/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Casey</a> and <a href=""https://www.toomey.senate.gov/"" target=""_blank"">Pat Toomey</a> to oppose the House Farm Bill (H.R. 2) federal forestry provisions and to speak out publicly against the egregious attacks on American&rsquo;s wild national forests. </strong>We ask that our Representatives and Senators work towards a bipartisan bill with strong forestry and conservation titles that are free from provisions that will put in jeopardy our lands, water, and wildlife.&nbsp;</p>

A Recap of the 2018 PA Clean Water Lobby Day,5/14/2018,"<p>PennFuture recently teamed up with our partners from the Chose Clean Water Coalition (CCWC) and the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed (CDRW) to stand side by side to address an issue critical to us all: clean water.</p>

<p>In total, 26 members from our groups came together April 30 during the PA Clean Water Lobby Day to educate lawmakers in a great series of meetings which highlighted the importance of clean water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout the day, our discussions with elected officials centered around Pennsylvania&rsquo;s need for a dedicated clean water fund, proper funding for our state resource agencies like the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, and asking that Pennsylvania&nbsp;start doing its fair share of fully funding our state water basin commissions,&nbsp;such as the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, Delaware River Basin Commission, Interstate Commission for the Potomac River Basin, and the Ohio River Sanitary Authority Commission.</p>

<p>The day was a huge success, thanks in large part to&nbsp;the phenomenal advocates and professionals we work alongside. But, this time next year, we want to think bigger and better. Our goal is to have environmental advocates from&nbsp; throughout the Commonwealth unite in the Capitol Main Rotunda with the singular message of protecting life&rsquo;s most precious natural resource: water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want to thank the speakers who came out and expressed what clean water means to them, including:&nbsp;Marel King of Chesapeake Bay Commission, Rep. Mike Sturla, 96th District, Member of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, Rep. Leanne Krueger-Braneky, Delaware - 161st Legislative District, PennFuture President and CEO Jacquelyn&nbsp;Bonomo, Mariah Davis, Field Manager &ndash; Choose Clean Water Coalition,&nbsp; Madeline Emde, State Policy Manager &ndash; Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed,&nbsp;Stephanie Wein, Water &amp; Conservation Advocate &ndash; PennEnvironment,&nbsp; and&nbsp;Jackson, Clean Water Supply Associate&nbsp; &ndash; American Rivers.

The New Tax Law and Charitable Giving,5/14/2018,"<div><em>Note: The information presented here is for educational and informational purposes only. Please consult your personal financial advisor and/or attorney on all legal, tax, or financial issues related to your charitable giving.&nbsp;</em></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Since the tax law changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed last year, there has been much discussion about how it will affect charitable giving. Some have even speculated that the changes will greatly hurt nonprofit organizations, such as PennFuture, who rely on your support. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The <strong>good news</strong> is that there are key tax code provisions which will continue to <strong>impact charitable giving in favorable ways.</strong> You can still enjoy important tax benefits while meeting your charitable goals.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>How the new tax cuts affect you depends on many factors, including family size, available deductions, and income. And, of course, <strong>you need to talk with your own financial advisors.</strong> But, here is a brief overview of the key provisions of the new tax law and how it affects charitable giving this year.&nbsp;</div>

<ul>
	<li>The standard deduction increases substantially and fewer people will itemize their taxes. The result? <em><strong>Taxpayers can still realize charitable giving goals and some donors will have even more discretionary funds available for planning.</strong></em></li>
	<li>The amount of charitable cash contributions that can be deducted in any particular year has been increased from 50 percent&nbsp;of adjusted gross income to 60 percent&nbsp;of adjusted gross income. <strong>This is particularly helpful for donors making a large, legacy-shaping gift.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Donor Advised Funds</strong> were not affected by the new law, which means contributions to these funds continue to be deductible when made. Donors can select the timing and amounts of gifts that are made from the fund, just as they have in the past.</li>
	<li>Gifts of retirement assets (including <strong>charitable distributions from an IRA for those age 70&frac12; or over</strong>) remain particularly attractive charitable giving options. The new tax law passed in December 2017 did not change the popular gift option known as the <strong>IRA Charitable Rollover</strong>&mdash;a charitable distribution from your IRA directly to PennFuture. This is good news for IRA owners age 70&frac12; and over who must take a required minimum distribution from their IRA and also want to support our work in 2018. You can use your IRA to make a meaningful gift now and avoid taxes on the IRA distribution. It&rsquo;s easy to do.
	<ul>
		<li>Instruct your IRA custodian to make a distribution directly to PennFuture. The distribution counts toward your required minimum distribution (RMD).</li>
		<li>Although there is no tax deduction, the distribution is excluded from your income for federal tax purposes&mdash;<strong>no tax is due!</strong></li>
		<li>Up to $100,000 of your gift qualifies for this favorable tax treatment.</li>
		<li>Your gift makes an immediate impact<strong>&mdash;<strong>there is no need to wait until the end of the year!</strong></strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For many of our friends, moving beyond the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; gift planning options makes it possible to experience even greater personal benefits. For example, <strong>there are two reasons why a gift of stock may be more advantageous than a gift of cash.</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>There is no capital gains tax due on the appreciated amount.</li>
		<li>The full amount of the gift qualifies for an itemized tax deduction.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<div>Please let us know how we might help you and your advisors explore charitable strategies under the new law. You can always call me directly at 717-214-7924, or email me at <a href=""mailto:dinicola@pennfuture.org"">dinicola@pennfuture.org</a>.&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Thank you! Your continued support for PennFuture&rsquo;s mission makes a lasting difference.&nbsp;</strong></div>

Introducing the Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda and the Green In ’18 Campaign,5/1/2018,"<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/green%2Din%2D18%2Dweb%2Dlogo%2D%2D4%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 650px; height: 175px;"" /></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-From-the-CEO-PennFuture-Priorities-in-2018"" target=""_blank"">In a December 2017 blog post about PennFuture&rsquo;s 2018 priorities</a>, President and CEO Jacquelyn Bonomo wrote, &ldquo;As part of our new civic engagement program, PennFuture will launch its Green In &rsquo;18 campaign. The campaign will elevate the public discussion around environmental issues in the upcoming elections.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Since then, PennFuture has been working with 20+ environmental, land, air, and water groups and organizations to identify the biggest environment challenges facing Pennsylvania.</strong> <strong>As a result, this coalition has created and agreed upon the most promising policy solutions to these threats. This process led to the creation of the <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Updated-Final-Version-of-the-PA-Common-Conservation-Agenda-5.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank""><u>first-ever Pennsylvania Common Conservation Agenda</u></a>, a blueprint for restoring and preserving our life-sustaining natural resources.</strong></p>

<p>Not only do these solutions promote a healthier environment and a stronger economy, they are publicly popular, fiscally responsible, and can be enacted by our next Governor using his or her executive authority.&nbsp;In virtually every instance, increases in state spending will be offset through job growth, revenue growth, energy savings, and/or lower healthcare costs.</p>

<p><strong>The agenda was released today during a press conference in Harrisburg, and it will be shared with all&nbsp;candidates running to be Pennsylvania&rsquo;s next governor.</strong>&nbsp;<a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/Updated-Final-Version-of-the-PA-Common-Conservation-Agenda-5.1.18.pdf"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>Click here to read it</strong></u></a> and to find out how you can <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/greenin18"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>get involved in the Green in &rsquo;18 campaign</strong></u></a>, which is mobilizing citizens to elevate environmental issues and the policy solutions within the agenda for all candidates running for governor.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why the candidates?</strong></em> We believe the upcoming gubernatorial election represents is an ideal time to push for changes in the state&rsquo;s priorities and policies for safeguarding the environment. So, during the election cycle, coalition members will be taking this agenda to the gubernatorial candidates and urging each one to enact our recommendations if they are elected.</p>

<p><em><strong>Easy, right? </strong></em>If only. In reality, it&rsquo;s going to take more than our efforts alone to get the candidates to consider and ultimately implement our agenda. It&rsquo;s also going to require a groundswell of support from Pennsylvania voters, speaking out on several crucial issues. But while the majority of Pennsylvania citizens think the state should do more to safeguard the environment (<a href=""https://www.fandm.edu/uploads/files/708725106986767486-f-m-poll-release-march-2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"">see results of March 2018 Franklin and Marshall College Poll</a>), the environment is one of many issues voters consider important. To make sure the environment is front and center in the minds of&nbsp;citizens and all of the candidates, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/greenin18"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>we will be backing the agenda with the Green In &rsquo;18 campaign.</strong></u></a></p>

<p><strong>PennFuture&rsquo;s new Green in &lsquo;18 campaign will be reaching out to citizens, community groups, and businesses to let them know about the policy solutions we are advocating as a coalition. </strong>We have a simple message: a healthy environment is best for everyone in Pennsylvania&mdash;children, families, workers, retirees, businesses&mdash;now and those yet to come. And the Common Conservation Agenda is the most feasible way to restore and preserve our state&rsquo;s environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through this process, we hope to increase the urgency of environmental issues in citizens&#39; minds, earn their support for the agenda, and motivate them to attend candidates&rsquo; events to ask those candidates where they stand on the environment, what their plans are to safeguard our air, land, and water, and whether they support the agenda. This is the type of pressure that will force the candidates to address our concerns and prioritize clean air, pure water, and a healthy climate.</p>

<p><em><strong>How can you get involved? </strong></em>For our movement to succeed, we need friends of the environment like you to volunteer to help with the Green In &rsquo;18 campaign. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/green18/index.html"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>You can fill out the form available here to get started.&nbsp;</strong></u></a></p>

<p>This is a pivotal moment for the environment in Pennsylvania. The threats have never been more urgent. But thanks to the election calendar, the surging resistance to the status quo among citizens, and the unprecedented unification among conservation organizations in the state, the prospects for difference-making action have never been more positive. By building an army of volunteers&nbsp;committed to rising up for the environment and the Common Conservation Agenda, we believe our cause will be successful. Please join us.</p>

What Act 40 Means for Solar Energy in PA,4/26/2018,"<p><em><strong>UPDATE:&nbsp;PUC&rsquo;s final implementation order on the solar borders issue was released May 3. <a href=""http://www.puc.pa.gov/pcdocs/1565100.docx"" target=""_blank"">Click here to read more.&nbsp;</a></strong></em></p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-Pennsylvania-Public-Utility-Commission-Removes-Barriers-to-Solar-Growth"">On Thursday, April 19, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) took an important step forward</a> and removed a long-standing barrier that kept solar projects from being built in Pennsylvania. In a unanimous vote, the PUC implemented the bipartisan Act 40 to require solar-credited projects under the state Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) be built in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>While Pennsylvania is traditionally a leader on developing and installing new energy sources, we have been lagging behind surrounding states when it comes to deploying solar energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania ranked 19th behind Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Ohio in the most recent <a href=""https://www.thesolarfoundation.org/national/""><strong>Solar Jobs Report.</strong></a>&nbsp;The Commonwealth is ranked 39th in solar jobs per capita. Massachusetts alone had about three times more solar jobs than Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why Pennsylvania lags behind.&nbsp;One issue is that the solar alternative energy credit program (SAEC*) part of our AEPS has much lower targets than many nearby states. Pennsylvania requires 0.5% solar energy by 2021 compared to 4.1% by 2028 in New Jersey, 2.5% by 2020 in Maryland, and 8.4% by 2030 in New York.&nbsp;Compounding the problem, Pennsylvania was one of the only states in the region with &ldquo;open borders&rdquo; that allowed solar from anywhere on our electric grid -- encompassing 13 surrounding states and the District of Columbia -- to be used for compliance.&nbsp;This lowered the value of SAECs in the state, meaning solar jobs went elsewhere.&nbsp;According to the most recent AEPS report, more than 60% of SAECs in 2017 came from out of state.</p>

<p>Last December, Governor Wolf signed into law Act 40, a bipartisan bill that requires solar-credited projects to be built in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, the PUC originally proposed to implement the bill in a way that would make it almost completely ineffective and still allow projects to be sourced outside of the state. This changed last week when all five PUC commissioners voted in favor of a joint statement by Chairman Brown and Vice Chairman Place that reversed that decision.</p>

<p>Going forward, new credits must now come from facilities connected to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s distribution system. Specifically, Act 40 changes the following depending on when a solar project was credited under the AEPS:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/solarblog%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 671px; height: 389px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>What does this mean for the value of my SAECs?</strong></p>

<p>Since Act 40 was signed by the governor, SAEC prices have risen from about $6 to around $11, but it&rsquo;s unclear how much of that is attributable to the change in law.&nbsp; Because a relatively large amount of credits are banked, most in the industry are not expecting to see the full impact of this rule for at least two more years.&nbsp; Still, Act 40 is a good start and will lead to more solar projects in Pennsylvania in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have taken a step in the right direction, Pennsylvania should make the commitment to becoming a solar leader. We have a lot of tools at our disposal to get there; some things to consider include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Increasing the AEPS solar target to be more in line with surrounding states.</li>
	<li>Enabling Community Solar so families and businesses that can&rsquo;t install their own solar panels have meaningful access to solar.</li>
	<li>Encouraging more and better financing options for solar.</li>
	<li>Making sure solar gets the same state tax benefits that fossil fuel projects enjoy.</li>
	<li>Ensuring energy purchases fully account for public health and environmental costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture is working with the PA DEP, US Department of Energy, industry experts, and over 450 stakeholders to evaluate options like these, but even the best ideas are not going to get implemented without strong public support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Public Comment Closes on DRBC Fracking Regulations,4/24/2018,"<p>On March 30, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) closed its four-month public comment period on proposed regulations of fracking and fracking-related activities.&nbsp;The DRBC received 227 oral comments over six&nbsp;public hearings, and over 8,600 written comments, which includes petitions in favor of the proposed ban signed by tens of thousands of individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2018-03-30-PennFuture-Comments-on-DRBC-Fracking-Draft-Regulations.pdf"">PennFuture&rsquo;s comments to the DRBC</a> strongly supported the proposed prohibition on fracking within the Basin, and called on the DRBC to strengthen its proposed regulations on both water withdrawals for fracking outside of the Basin and the transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of fracking wastewater within the Basin. If those regulations cannot be strengthened in order to protect the Delaware River water resources, then the DRBC must not allow these activities to occur.&nbsp;Like PennFuture, it appears that a good number of commenters supported the fracking ban, yet called for stronger regulations of those fracking-related activities to protect our waters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The majority of the public comments received called for a full ban on all fracking-related activities, including water withdrawals and wastewater treatment. However, there was a large contingent of comments that opposed the proposed ban on fracking, lead primarily by gas industry interests.&nbsp;All written comments received by the DRBC are available for review and download <a href=""http://www.nj.gov/drbc/meetings/proposed/notice_hydraulic-fracturing.html"">through the DRBC&rsquo;s website.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>The DRBC has no set deadline by which they must make their final decisions to adopt, modify, or reject the proposed fracking regulations. This final decision, however, is likely to take several months, if not longer.&nbsp;The DRBC must not only review each comment in their decision-making process, but must also draft a written comment response document that responds to each type of comment (not each individual comment) submitted.&nbsp;During its review of the comments, DRBC will likely consult with experts and may even possibly conduct additional research.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The DRBC&rsquo;s responses and recommendations will then be submitted to the five Commissioners for a vote. Assuming no changes to the proposed regulations, it seems likely that the regulations will be adopted by the Commissioners, who include the governors of the four Basin states and a representative of the U.S. government.&nbsp;The governors of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York had previously voted to propose the regulations, and the new governor of New Jersey has expressed his support for the fracking ban, making a 4-1 vote in favor of adopting the proposed regulations the most likely outcome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What this all seems to foreshadow is that, regardless of what the DRBC&rsquo;s final adopted regulations do, there will be legal challenges. If the DRBC adopts the regulations as proposed, it&rsquo;s likely that they will receive challenges from both sides of the aisle &ndash; environmentalists and anti-fracking supporters arguing the regulations didn&rsquo;t go far enough to protect the Delaware River water resources and industry, and pro-fracking supporters arguing that the regulations go too far.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>During the pendency of any legal challenges to the DRBC&rsquo;s final regulations regarding fracking in the Basin, the &ldquo;<a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Moratorium-on-Fracking-in-the-Delaware-River-Basin-is-Critical-to-Protect-Our-Water"">de facto moratorium</a>&rdquo; on fracking that has been in place since 2010 will most likely continue, thereby protecting the Delaware River Basin while the issue makes its way through the courts.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end, PennFuture is confident that fracking will not be allowed to jeopardize our water, environment, and health within the Delaware River Basin. PennFuture remains committed to protecting the Delaware River Basin and will keep you updated as this matter moves forward. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/newsletter-sign-up"">Please click here to subscribe to our emails for regular updates on this issue.</a></p>

Building a Community Clean Water Toolbox: How PA Will Meet its Goals,4/23/2018,"<p>On April 10, nearly 200 leaders from county conservation districts, agriculture, municipal governments, environmental groups, water companies, and other entities participated in a workshop focused around the state plan for improving water quality in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Participants shared their expertise and aided in the development of the Community Clean Water Toolbox to draft policy and suggestions to help Pennsylvania meet its Total Maximum Pollution Reduction (TMDL) goals by 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the conference, the group learned about planning, engagement, resource, tracking, and implementation tools that would be available to counties for developing and implementing action plans to reduce pollution runoff into our waterways. The areas in focus for initial pilot development are Lancaster, York, Adams, and Franklin County. These counties will lead the way in development and create their action plans by October. After the initial toolbox is created and implemented in these counties, it will then be further modified (as needed) for use by the other counties in the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From this meeting, there are a few points that everyone took home: We need more community engagement, Lancaster County has the most opportunity for pollution reduction in the Commonwealth, and forested riparian buffers are the most cost-effective way of meeting our pollution reduction goals.</p>

<p>In terms of community engagement, it will play a critical role in the state&rsquo;s ability to meet its goals for the plan. The PA Department of Environmental Protection will not be enforcing compliance through regulatory oversight; instead, its aim is to have counties use the numbers presented to them to define pollution reduction goals and identify existing and proposed local initiatives that can be used to help meet them. The end game is having a county-level approach that will lead Pennsylvania in attaining its pollution reduction goals&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second major takeaway from the event centered on the amount of nutrient and sediment runoff in Lancaster County. Due to the lack of trees in the county, and the amount of populated areas coupled with the abundance of farming, Lancaster has earned a reputation as a major load-producing geography that contributes to the condition of the Chesapeake Bay. Because of this, a major focus of the Watershed Implementation Plan Steering Committee is looking at Lancaster and York County as sites for &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; programs that will implement these best management practices (BMP), and then modify them as necessary after the Phase III WIP is set into motion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, the Steering Committee showcased a study that indicated riparian buffers to be the most cost-efficient and results-driven form of BMP that can be implemented. Riparian buffers are patches of vegetation and trees surrounding a stream or body of water that helps shade and protect the stream from the impacts of adjacent land uses. Implementing riparian buffers throughout the Commonwealth will aide in the restoration of streams by protecting the fish and inhabitants of the water and provide a natural balance to the ecosystem, because they absorb runoff and cool the temperature of the creeks and streams.</p>

<p>As great as these initiatives are, there is still work that needs to be done. Pennsylvania still remains nearly 60 percent behind schedule for the TMDL, funding sources for implementing clean water projects still seems out of reach, and we are woefully underperforming compared to our neighboring states. However, the leadership shown at this conference is a step in the right direction. Now comes the difficult part &ndash; translating this down to the local level and installing BMP&rsquo;s on time to meet our state goals.&nbsp;</p>

Meet PennFuture's Director of Development: M. Travis DiNicola,4/16/2018,"<div>When you think back on your favorite memories, how many of them took place outdoors?&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>With most of my memories, I don&rsquo;t recall just the places and people that made a moment special, but the atmosphere. I remember the season&mdash;the rain, the snow, the warmth or coolness of the air. And I remember the light.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>About two years ago when my wife and I decided to move back to Pennsylvania to be closer to our families, she asked me what part of coming home was I most excited about. I told her that all of my best memories of summer took place in Pennsylvania. There is something about the atmosphere here that is very special.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Growing up in Erie, I was fortunate to spend much of my youth exploring Presque Isle: going on hikes with my grandfather, biking the trails, windsurfing on the lake, fishing on the bay, canoeing the inlets, and of course, hanging out with friends on the beaches. Presque Isle was my playground. It was there that I discovered my passion for flying stunt kites&mdash;a passion I continue to enjoy today when I fly my kites off the edge of City Island in the middle of the mighty Susquehanna.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>After studying theatre and dance as an undergrad and then art and museum education as a graduate student at Penn State, my career took me to Indianapolis. For 20 years, I worked in many capacities there as a champion of mission-based organizations, including arts, education, and community-service groups. I emceed a number of events for environmental organizations, and hosted a monthly &ldquo;climate-change quiz-show&rdquo; for a few years at a local theatre.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I am most proud of the 10 years I spent as the Executive Director of Indy Reads, an adult literacy program. During my tenure, I created Indy Reads Books, a nonprofit bookstore and community arts center in downtown Indianapolis. It was there that I edited and published Indy Writes Books: A Book Lover&rsquo;s Anthology, which features Indiana authors writing about their love of books, bookstores, and reading. While in Indianapolis, I was also fortunate to be the co-host and producer of a weekly arts talk show on the local public radio station.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I greatly enjoyed my time in the Midwest, but it wasn&rsquo;t home. Pennsylvania and its air, mountains, and water&mdash;this is home. This is where my wife and I got married, in the garden of her family&rsquo;s farm that sits on the Conewago. Since coming back to PA, my wife and I have already been creating wonderful new outdoor memories: fly-fishing on Big Spring, kayaking on the Susquehanna, hiking Ricketts Glen, biking on the Capital Area Greenbelt, and kite flying on City Island.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Our natural resources in Pennsylvania are incredible, they should be treasured, and they deserve to be protected. This is why I am so proud to be the new Director of Development for PennFuture. There are few things more important to me than PennFuture&rsquo;s work in protecting our air, water and land. This is a mission that I proudly champion.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>As the Director of Development, it is my job to make certain that PennFuture has the funds it needs to be able to fulfill that mission, and to ensure our future sustainability. In this role, I have two very important responsibilities:</div>

<ul>
	<li>To represent PennFuture as best as I can to you, our supporters.</li>
	<li>To represent you as best as I can to PennFuture.</li>
</ul>

<div>My approach to fundraising? It is a two-way street. I will communicate accurate and helpful information to you about the great organization that you have chosen to support.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>What can you do? Tell me why PennFuture, and the work we do, is worthy of your support.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The most important thing a Development Director can bring to an organization isn&rsquo;t a big donation, it is your trust.&nbsp; As your representative, it is my pledge to you that I will be transparent and honest in everything I do to further the mission of PennFuture.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>So, let&rsquo;s get to know each other. I would love to hear from you. Please contact me at <a href=""mailto:dinicola@pennfuture.org"">dinicola@pennfuture.org</a> or at 717-214-7924 with any questions, concerns, or thoughts you have regarding your support of PennFuture.&nbsp;</div>

State Level Implications of Pruitt's Vehicle Emissions Rollback,4/12/2018,"<p>Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt&#39;s attempted rollback of vehicle emissions standards is dangerous, misguided, and will mean dirtier cars and a less competitive auto industry. How do we know this? We have been there before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to 2008, the auto industry built too many huge and high-profit-margin gas guzzling SUVs rather than a diversified fleet of options for consumers. Their shortsightedness left the industry dangerously exposed to rising gas prices. And, in the end, it took tens of billions of dollars in government aid to save the industry from their own poor choices.</p>

<p>For a time, the industry was ready to admit their fault. They came to the table and negotiated improved fuel economy standards in line with goals set by other countries. Unfortunately, the industry saw an opportunity in Scott Pruitt&rsquo;s anti-regulatory mania to return to their old irresponsible ways. Once again, they are claiming that they just can&rsquo;t make and sell cleaner cars. Even though cleaner vehicles will save American consumers over a trillion dollars in fuel costs and billions more in health and environmental benefits, far outweighing the additional $50 it might add to the sticker price, Pruitt is ready to hand his lobbyist pals whatever they ask for.</p>

<p>The EPA has a lot of power in this area. Section 209(a) of the Clean Air Act has a &ldquo;federal preemption&rdquo; provision that says &ldquo;no state...shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles&hellip;&rdquo; Fortunately, however, California was regulating emissions from vehicles long before the EPA, so the Clean Air Act allows them to continue to do so under a 209(b) waiver as long as their program is no less stringent than the federal one. The Act also gives other states the ability to choose between the EPA&rsquo;s program and the California one. Twelve states, including Pennsylvania, have opted into the California program.</p>

<p>No one thinks it&rsquo;s ideal to have two different programs. In fact, one of the purposes of the &ldquo;Tier III&rdquo; emissions controls that are at issue was to harmonize the standards. Now though, instead of continuing with the agreed-upon standards, anti-environmental and anti-regulatory activists are asking Pruitt to revoke the California waiver. If he does, that would leave Pennsylvania with no choice but to accept more pollution from our cars and worse gas mileage.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s bad enough, but there are additional complications. Pennsylvania made its clean vehicle program part of its &ldquo;State Implementation Plan&rdquo; (SIP) for meeting federal ozone standards. Currently, 17 of our counties are out of compliance and we need to demonstrate we are adopting permanent, quantifiable, and enforceable emissions reductions to clean up their air. This SIP program also contains an &ldquo;anti-backsliding&rdquo; provision, where losing an enforceable strategy, like the clean vehicle program, requires the state to find something else to take its place.</p>

<p>As Pennsylvanians, we have a right to clean air, but we also expect our government to pick the most cost-effective programs to achieve that goal. Even though vehicles are responsible for about a third of the pollution in the state and the clean car program is highly cost effective, federal preemption means we can&rsquo;t regulate them on our own -- we need the California waiver. If Pruitt revokes that, we may need to get additional emissions reductions from businesses in the state -- no matter what the cost.</p>

Maya K. van Rossum: Woman of the Delaware River Watershed,4/5/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Maya K. van Rossum</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Maya is receiving the Woman of the Delaware River Watershed award at <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">PennFuture&#39;s Fourth Annual Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards</a> on April 19 in Philadelphia&nbsp;for her protection of the watershed through advocacy and leadership at Delaware Riverkeeper Network.</strong></em></p>

<p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>I grew up in the Delaware River watershed, playing in Ithan Creek, a tributary to the Darby Creek, which is a tributary to the Delaware. I remember playing for hours in the water, squishing my feet in the sandy soils on its banks, walking through the culvert that carried the creek under the road, and sitting quietly under a tree with big sprawling roots and branches, just watching the water go quietly by. I guess this is the time and place when my love for our beautiful watershed was born and grew its own roots. Watching the damage inflicted on the creeks, forests and animals of my community is when I learned that nature needs a voice in our human world, and without it, nature is truly at the mercy of people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Delaware Riverkeeper Network was formed in 1988 when our watershed residents, like I did as a child, recognized that the Delaware River, its tributaries and natural communities need people who will give it a voice in our human community, to ensure it gets the highest level of protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For 24 years, I have had the honor of leading the Delaware Riverkeeper Network and of bearing the title of the Delaware Riverkeeper. But of course, championing the rights of our river and communities to free flow, health, and abundant life is not the job of one person; it is the job of a community. That is what the Delaware Riverkeeper Network is all about: creating and supporting the community willing to stand up and both speak and act in defense of our river and watershed.</p>

<p>The most rewarding aspect of this award for me is that residents from communities I work with nominated me. Every day, I have the honor of working with people who care deeply about our natural resources and one another. They are threatened by toxic contamination, threatened by the taking of their property for a pipeline, fearful that fracking will be allowed to come to our watershed and devastate their lives, suffering from growing flooding, or worried about the loss of a special species. These are people with tremendous integrity, strength and spirit. That these people took the time out of their busy lives and away from the environmental cause they are working so hard on to nominate me, is the greatest honor.</p>

<p>With so many challenges facing our River and communities, it can be easy to lose sight of the progress and successes we have achieved with our watershed community. The Delaware Riverkeeper Network in 1989 submitted and advocated a petition before the Delaware River Basin Commission that changed the course of our River&rsquo;s history. The petition and supporting advocacy resulted in the creation of the Special Protection Waters program, giving highest legal protection to the Middle and Upper Delaware. A second petition we submitted in 2001 extended that protection to the Lower Delaware River, resulting in the longest stretch of river anywhere in the nation (197 miles) with this highest level of protection. In 2010, it is this protection that became the basis of the moratorium that has protected our Delaware River watershed from drilling and fracking operations, including the water withdrawals and wastewater storage and disposal. Today, we are working hard to make these protections complete and permanent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Delaware Riverkeeper Network was the lead plaintiff with the American Littoral Society (of whom the organization was originally a part) in the case that resulted in Pennsylvania and Delaware implementing the Total Maximum Daily Load regulations (TMDLs) required by the Clean Water Act, and is now the basis of the often applauded Chesapeake Bay TMDL. Until our litigation and settlement, this critical portion of the law had been ignored by both states.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Delaware Riverkeeper Network has been instrumental in protecting the horseshoe crabs of the Delaware Bay and River&rsquo;s genetically unique population of Atlantic sturgeon; defeating dam proposals and having them replaced with more beneficial strategies; advancing strong stormwater and development strategies; and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most recently, I have been advancing a national Green Amendment movement. My new book, titled <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Green-Amendment-Securing-Healthy-Environment/dp/1633310213""><strong>The Green Amendment</strong></a>, tells the story of how the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, working with seven towns, secured the constitutional right of the people of Pennsylvania to pure water, clean air and a healthy environment by breathing legal life into the long ignored constitutional provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The legal victory achieved in 2013 in the case Robinson Twp., Delaware Riverkeeper Network v. Commonwealth, not only defeated a very damaging pro-fracking piece of legislation, but has since been used by my organization and communities throughout the state to protect the rights of communities to a healthy environment in those situations when the state has itself, or through the actions of others, overstepped to infringe upon those rights. The value of this victory should not stop at the borders of Pennsylvania. I see a vision for inspiring the whole nation to follow Pennsylvania&rsquo;s lead and to seek and secure constitutional provisions in every state in the nation and at the federal level that recognize and protect the right to a healthy environment as inalienable rights with the same level of protection we give other fundamental rights like the right to free speech and freedom of religion. My deepest hope is that we start a Green Amendment movement that sweeps the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

",Environment,
Reality Check: Supreme Court Decision on Water Pollution No Cause for Alarm,3/29/2018,"<p>There has already been a fair amount written about a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision issued yesterday involving the state&rsquo;s effort to penalize EQT under the Clean Streams Law (CSL) for allowing a shale gas wastewater impoundment to leak and contaminate groundwater in Tioga County in 2012.</p>

<p>As an initial matter, it should be noted that the Supreme Court <em><strong>did not</strong></em> decide that the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s (DEP&rsquo;s) proposed $4.5 million dollar penalty was excessive.&nbsp;Because of how this case made its way to the Supreme Court, the reasonableness of DEP&rsquo;s proposed civil penalty was not before the Court for a decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This case arose from a complaint that EQT filed in Commonwealth Court after DEP had presented EQT with a proposed civil penalty calculation based in part on groundwater contamination that resulted from operation of the impoundment.&nbsp;EQT asked the Commonwealth Court, under a statute known as the Declaratory Judgments Act, to decide an issue of law - <strong>whether penalties continued to accrue under the CSL so long as pollutants remained in groundwater.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Court initially dismissed the complaint on procedural grounds, but the Supreme Court disagreed and returned the matter for a decision. On remand, the Commonwealth Court ruled in favor of EQT and DEP appealed that decision back to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;<strong>So, the question before the Supreme Court was a relatively narrow one about how to interpret the CSL, and not about the reasonableness of DEP&rsquo;s proposed civil penalty.</strong></p>

<p>Regarding that legal question, the Supreme Court made a number of pronouncements. <strong>First, it held that the mere presence of pollution in groundwater does not, in and of itself, constitute a violation of the CSL.</strong>&nbsp;The Court said that the touchstone of a violation under the CSL was the introduction of pollutants into the waters of the Commonwealth - not their continued presence in those waters.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Second, the Supreme Court addressed what came to be known as DEP&rsquo;s &ldquo;water-to-water theory&rdquo; of liability.</strong> Under this theory, the state asserted the right to assess a penalty when the contaminants moved from one discrete body of water into another, such as when pollutants moved from groundwater into surface water, or into areas of uncontaminated groundwater. The Court rejected DEP&rsquo;s argument that it could impose a penalty based on the movement of contaminants within bodies of water, or from one body of water to another.</p>

<p><strong>Third, the Supreme Court rejected the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s interpretation that Section 401 of the CSL did not regulate industrial waste.</strong> Section 401 prohibits any person who owns or occupies property from discharging any substance of any kind into waters of the Commonwealth causing pollution. This was a pretty big deal, because the Commonwealth Court badly mangled and narrowed its application based on the title of the section and little more.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, the Supreme Court declined to speak to the third theory, upon which DEP based its penalty assessment, namely the so-called &ldquo;soil-to-water theory.&rdquo; </strong>Under this theory, an ongoing violation occurs for each day that pollutants are released from soil into the waters of the Commonwealth. The EHB applied a variation on this theory in issuing a $1.1 million dollar penalty for this incident. Both DEP and EQT have appealed that decision to the Commonwealth Court.&nbsp;<strong>The Court&rsquo;s ruling against the agency on its water-to-water theory may seem concerning at first, but there are reasons why it should, in the end, not substantially impact DEP&rsquo;s ability to protect our streams and rivers. </strong></p>

<p><strong>First, it is important to understand that this case was about penalties, not about the state&rsquo;s ability to prevent or clean up pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Penalties serve an important purpose, but DEP has many other tools to use in ensuring protection and prompt clean-up of water pollution. And the Court made clear that its decision was not intended to limit DEP&rsquo;s use of those tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, this case concerned one type of penalty - a civil monetary penalty. If the state believed that a pollution event was so egregious that a civil monetary penalty did not adequately address the extent of harm or sufficiently deter future conduct, then DEP could seek to impose criminal penalties on the responsible parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Third, the state could use its administrative powers to effectively implement its water-to-water theory.</p>

<p>The argument that DEP made in court was that as pollution migrated from one water body to another, a separate violation of the CSL occurred. Consider, for example, a factory that grossly contaminated groundwater on its property, and over time, that pollution also threatened to leak into a nearby stream. The Supreme Court said that the release of pollution to the groundwater was a violation, but not migration of that pollution to another body of water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, DEP has authority, based on the initial violation, to issue a compliance order preventing the spread of that contamination.&nbsp;So, if it issued an order to the responsible party to prevent the discharge of pollution to the stream, and the pollution subsequently made it into the stream, that would constitute a violation of DEP&rsquo;s order, which in turn also constitutes a violation of the CSL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>By using its administrative tools, DEP has the ability to protect, in this scenario, the stream, and penalize the actor whose conduct threatened its harm.</strong></p>

<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision may alter how the DEP approaches pollution incidents. The agency may need to rethink how it collects evidence and proves that there is an ongoing discharge of pollutants to waters of the Commonwealth. It may need to rethink how to use its other tools to ensure protection of other bodies of water associated with the initial release of pollutants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, the DEP may need to reconsider the role that criminal penalties should play in altering the conduct of persons who harm the waters of the Commonwealth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In the end, however, this Supreme Court decision should not have a substantial impact on the state&rsquo;s ability to protect the waters of the Commonwealth and punish those who cause them harm.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q. Where did you grow up?&nbsp;<br />
A. </strong>I grew up in Philadelphia, home of the Super Bowl-winning Eagles, and the greatest cheesesteaks in all of the land, from John&rsquo;s Roast Pork (on Snyder Avenue).</p>

<p><strong>Q. Can you describe your educational background?&nbsp;<br />
A. </strong>Bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in economics, and a second degree in music industry (majoring in opera), and a master&rsquo;s degree in environmental studies, focusing on science and policy. I have very understanding parents.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What first inspired you to work in conservation?&nbsp;<br />
A.</strong> It was a process of elimination and self-discovery, more Goldilocks than grandeur. I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted to do when I was younger. After college, I began working in the financial management industry, which was lucrative, but didn&rsquo;t feel quite right to me. I went back to school for music, while working on the corporate side of the music industry. This was an extremely cool experience, but not intellectually fulfilling, and the Metropolitan opera wasn&rsquo;t exactly knocking on my door.&nbsp;I wanted the right combination of mental engagement, personal fulfillment, and economic stability. I spent the majority of my childhood on farms, riding horses, and enjoying the outdoors. This is where my environmental sensibilities took root.&nbsp;When I learned about the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental studies program, I felt it might be &ldquo;just right.&rdquo;&nbsp;I worked at an environmental consulting firm during graduate school, and have been working on environmental and energy issues ever since.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. What is a day in the life like in your current position?&nbsp;<br />
A.</strong> A lot of reading, research, data analysis, and writing, all of which I really enjoy and feel privileged to be able to do on a daily basis. With a focus on applied research, I get the opportunity to talk to and learn from industry and academic leaders, as well as regulators and policy makers. Being on campus and surrounded by such smart people all of the time is inspiring, and humbling. It is also exciting to be around so many young, brilliant kids who are so socially aware. I just wish they weren&rsquo;t a constant reminder of my advancing age.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q. What motivates you to keep going?<br />
A. </strong>My daughter, my extremely supportive husband, and close-knit family.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m luckier than I deserve. I try to give back in honor of my good fortune.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Q. Who inspires you in terms of female leaders?&nbsp;<br />
A. </strong>Women like Katie McGinty (who hired me out of graduate school), Cheryl LaFleur (commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), and Gina McCarthy (former EPA Administrator) are impressive not only because they have accomplished so much in their careers, but also because they are fierce, wicked-smart, full of personality, and are moms to boot.&nbsp;My co-workers who have multiple children are also sources of inspiration, because I see them every day working magic at home and in the office. I never considered myself a feminist until I had my daughter.&nbsp;Now, as a mom, I&rsquo;m convinced that women are super-heroes&hellip;and we are here to change the world.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What role do you think women specifically can play in environmental efforts today?&nbsp;<br />
A. </strong>I will shamelessly promote an essay entitled &ldquo;Arrival of the Fittest&rdquo; that I wrote for the book, &ldquo;51%: Women and the Future of Politics&rdquo; by Terri Spahr Nelson.&nbsp;The essay theorizes that through biology, women may be instinctually predisposed to better handle the political challenges facing our nation and globe in the future, as populations swell, competition for scarce resources intensifies, and environmental degradation increases. In so far as one believes that cooperation, not competition, will guide our species towards long-term self-sustainability, then the skills of the gatherer/nurturer may become more valuable compared to those of the hunter.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What are the biggest challenges you face?&nbsp;<br />
A. </strong>Keeping everything together on a day-to-day basis. Being a working mom is much harder than I thought, but also more rewarding than I could have expected. There are so many implicit demands on a woman&rsquo;s time, but I feel lucky it is this way.&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what it was like for women just a few generations ago, when home was the only frontier.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What does the future of conservation in PA look like, in your opinion?&nbsp;<br />
A.</strong> In the area of energy, Pennsylvania has, is, and will continue to be a national leader. The short-term challenges will be balance and transition. Continuing to improve environmental outcomes of energy production, distribution, and use, while making sure quality of life improves for residents. This must mean pursuing economic growth and development, in an affordable manner, and in a way that is consistent with our social values. These values not only include environmental stewardship, but must also assist those displaced as our energy systems evolve. Polarized positions&mdash;like &ldquo;renewables only,&rdquo; or &ldquo;drill-baby-drill&rdquo;&mdash;are easy because they provide a feeling of ideological comfort.&nbsp;And, in some states these positions may work. But, in Pennsylvania, progress will come from the universally uncomfortable reality of compromise.</p>

Katie McGinty: A Lifetime of Environmental Policymaking & Leadership,3/28/2018,"<p><strong>By Katie McGinty</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>PennFuture is honoring Katie McGinty with a lifetime achievement award at the <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">Fourth Annual Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards</a> for her work as a former state and federal environmental policy official, as she served as an environmental advisor to Vice President Al Gore and President Bill Clinton, and for her work as Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in the Cabinet of Governor Ed Rendell, among many other environmental policy leadership accomplishments.</em></strong></p>

<p>I have felt privileged to work throughout my career on protecting the environment. The reasons are obvious as well as more subtle: at an elemental level, nothing is more essential than air, land and water. So, there is no question that a career dedicated to the environment has purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Less straightforward, but even more compelling to me, is that the environment is and can be a common ground for humanity in a world rife with battle grounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, sometimes the environment can invite fighting words. We are all too familiar with the tired thinking that, &quot;It is jobs&lrm; or the environment; the environment or the economy.&quot;</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve seen action on the environment heal wounds, too. Neighbors banding together to clean their watershed, even when they otherwise have little in common; logging communities moving away from mowing forests down and adopting sustainable forest management to preserve timber jobs for the long haul, and to unleash local creativity to diversify the economy. I have seen coal towns recognize that making renewable energy equipment creates good jobs, while also helping to tackle climate change.</p>

<p><strong>Here is the key:&nbsp;</strong>using environmental problems not as a wedge, but as the glue to pull people together in joint purpose.</p>

<p>And we need that so very much now. I believe we face an existential moment in this still young democracy. We seem rapidly to be devolving into endlessly warring factions. Facts don&#39;t seem to matter and respect for a different point of view is in dangerously short supply. Tribalism is kryptonite to self-governance and representative democracy. Yet, attachment to our own narrow self-interests is trumping commitment to truth, to rule of law, to any attachment to transcendent ideas and ideals.</p>

<p>Calling forward our commitment to that special river, park, or to a climate that nurtures and sustains life can be a mighty force against the forces otherwise ripping and tearing us apart. Never has it been more urgent that we redouble our dedication to environmental protection as an inspiring mission, as something that binds and calls forth the &quot;better angels of our nature.&quot;</p>

<p>It is my honor to be recognized by PennFuture, an extraordinary organization that was always my &quot;go to&quot; partner in reaching far and high to protect the environment. With many joint efforts to celebrate, what a joy to know: we are just getting started!</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>Where did you grow up?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>As a child, I split my time between my parents, spending summers living in Detroit, Michigan, and the school year in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I have spent my adulthood living and working in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>Can you describe your educational background?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>I hold a B.A. in political science from the University of Pennsylvania and I am working toward completing my masters in environmental studies, also at the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What first inspired you to work in conservation?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>When I graduated with my undergrad degree, it was a toss up between working for a publishing company or an environmental group. I went to work for Natural Resources Defense Council as a research assistant in their Water and Oceans Department, and the rest is history. Growing up in cities with heavy industry along river ways, the rivers were often seen simply as dividing points from one part of the city to another in Philadelphia, or as a flowing borderline from one country to another in Detroit. It fascinated me to learn that life was as busy below the surface of these metropolitan rivers as it was above, and that they were both affecting one another in some visible but often invisible ways. I would have to say that&rsquo;s where my journey to understand the complicated relationship between humans and water began, and the curiosity and desire for a mutualistic relationship between the two has continued to drive my work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What is a day in the life like in your current position?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>It changes daily. During the winter, I am mostly teaching science once a week at Jubilee School, curriculum planning for boating season, or developing concepts for new bodies of artwork. Spring and summer are go-time for me! I am on the river most of the time, giving history and ecology tours at Bartram&rsquo;s and Glen Foerd. I also take high school students to perform scientific monitoring of the Schuylkill River, read and write about my reflections on space and society, or just nerd out with some sci-fi to unwind.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What motivates you to keep going?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>The youth I work with each day. Someone before me worked really hard and overcame challenges and busted down barriers so that I can do the work I am passionate about today. My hope is to make the path a little wider for the next generation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>Who inspires you in terms of female leaders?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>They may seem a bit unconventional as inspiring female leaders but I would have to say Storm from the X-Men and Octavia Butler. Storm is a fictional mutant super hero from Marvel who has the ability to control the weather. In her early years and eagerness to provide the village she was living in with relief from a drought, she brought on rain, and unfortunately the incident threw off the natural course of nature and wreaked havoc elsewhere resulting in lives lost. She lamented what she had done and learned to be more careful and thoughtful with her powers. For me, this stands out as an anecdotal reminder that good intentions are not always synonymous with what is right or even helpful. Careful thought and the absence of ego are important in making a difference for the better.&nbsp;Octavia Butler is a brilliant Sci-Fi author. She has a unique way of weaving science, social justice and storytelling together that is compelling and innovative. Her books still hold relevance today. I have always enjoyed using science-fiction or narrative in my teaching and art practice. In my mind, she is the standard for how to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What role do you think women specifically can play in environmental efforts today?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></strong>According to statistics, women make up around half of the world&rsquo;s population. The majority of studies are based on sex and not gender, so the numbers are subject to being flawed on the actual specifics. To this day, women are underrepresented in the sciences and politics. There is a significant loss of insight and perspective that is needed for scientific interpretation, policymaking, and advocacy, stunting growth and innovation.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What are the biggest challenges you face?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>The biggest challenge in my work at the moment is a lack of STEM and STEAM programs in schools due to scarce resources. There are more youth interested in the programs I work with than can be accommodated, which is a tragedy. There are youth in their formative years interested in science and they can&rsquo;t explore those inklings or sparks of curiosity that could potentially lead to job security, a diverse field of experts, and a better future for everyone, simply because the funding isn&rsquo;t being allocated to the right places. Another challenge I often face is that of representation. I am often one of very few people of color in the room when attending environmental conferences. Though in recent years, environmental justice has become a main focus for larger organizations, and communities of color have been a focal point, there is still a lack of actual representation from these communities in discussion, planning or decision-making.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>What does the future of conservation in PA look like, in your opinion?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>If we can improve school funding and get STEM and STEAM programs into the schools, bring communities of color into the planning process as we create policy and develop cities, and acknowledge our history, even when it is problematic, by promoting more truthful narratives of the past, I think we have a chance. We are in a place at the moment where I believe if we plan carefully, PA has the ability to become a leader and model, specifically for water conservation efforts and for large cities moving toward renewable energy.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q. Where did you grow up?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> I grew up in Massachusetts, in a suburb of Boston. The most memorable part of my childhood home was the undeveloped hill behind our small ranch house. My twin sister and I had many adventures &ndash; big and small &ndash; on that hill.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q.<span style=""white-space:pre""> Can you describe your e</span>ducation background?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> I did my undergraduate work at Antioch College in Ohio. It was a very progressive curriculum with no grades and rotations between on-campus academic quarters and off-campus quarters, where your education was a cooperative work experience.&nbsp;I really got to tailor my education and travel all over the North American continent. After college, I worked as a veterinary technician for a year before attending a graduate program in ecology at SUNY Syracuse. For my graduate research, I studied birds on an uninhabited island in Alaska for a year and a half with another graduate student &ndash; who, by the way, is now my husband of 18 years!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q. What first inspired you to work in conservation?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> I always felt a connection with nature growing up and I recognized at an early age that my life would be far less rich and meaningful if I was not able to connect with nature.&nbsp; What would life be like if I could not tune out of the stress and bustle of the &ldquo;daily grind&rdquo; and tune in to the joyful, life affirming beauty of a wren singing his heart out at dawn?&nbsp;I personally find strength in frequent reminders that the world is a much bigger and richer place than the small sphere of my daily experience. Encountering a deer in the woods or witnessing a hawk on the wing going about their business helps keep my perspective in check.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I started out my career thinking I wanted to be a wildlife biologist but ultimately, I came to the belief that the most fundamental thing that needs to be in place before conservation and environmental sustainability can happen is that people need to value nature.&nbsp;If nature is not personally meaningful or relevant to the vast majority of people, then there will not be enough will or drive or interest in doing the hard work and making the difficult choices we face in protecting it.&nbsp;The good news is that nature really has something of value to offer everyone. That is the truly remarkable thing about the natural world in all its dynamic complexity and stability &ndash; nature has a knack for meeting you where you are and giving you what you need, if you&rsquo;ll let it.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q. What is a day in the life like in your current position?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.&nbsp;</strong>My days are incredibly varied, although there are a couple constants.&nbsp;The first is that I spend a lot of time talking and engaging with people, whether it be my staff, our board of directors, residents, community partners, donors&hellip;you name it.&nbsp;The second is that I try to have lunch with my staff every day.&nbsp;We all break for a big communal lunch where we get to talk, eat and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; This brings me such joy and is a big part of setting the tone for the kind of culture I want at the office.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q. What motivates you to keep going?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> I have been incredibly fortunate to work with some really top-notch, smart and talented people and they are what motivate me every day.&nbsp;I have learned so much from my teams at the Schuylkill Center and at the Wissahickon Valley Watershed Association and it is my interactions and relationships with them that fuels me and keeps me going.&nbsp; They really are remarkable people who are passionate about making the world a better place.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q. Who inspires you in terms of female leaders?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> Marilyn Nyman is an incredibly successful entrepreneur, leader, and woman whom I admire.&nbsp;She inspires me to grow and challenge myself and she is a model for the kind of leader I want to be.&nbsp;Whenever I spend time with her, she gives me something interesting to think about, chew on, and try out.&nbsp;I am incredibly grateful for that.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q. What role do you think women specifically can play in environmental efforts today?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A.</strong> I think women can define a new leadership model for executives and organizational leaders, one that focuses on building community, collaboration and empathy.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q. What are the biggest challenges you face?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A. </strong>The environmental field is low-ranking in terms of our culture&rsquo;s priorities.&nbsp;It seems we have very little influence politically and socially compared to business, health and education, for example.&nbsp;In my role as Director of Education at the Schuylkill Center, I could see this play out in how parents tended to prioritize the experiences and opportunities they are providing their children.&nbsp;I spent a lot of time educating parents that giving their children unstructured opportunities to play outdoors are&nbsp;really important to their growth and development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Q. What does the future of conservation in PA look like, in your opinion?</strong></div>

<div><strong>A. </strong>Fewer organizational silos, more within-sector and cross-sector collaborations.&nbsp;I think cross-sector collaborations are essential to increasing our cultural influence.&nbsp;</div>

<div>If we want to grow a larger constituency of people who value nature, than we need to start the &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; or approach with an emphasis on other people&rsquo;s values, rather than on our environmental values.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about connecting with what motivates the people you are trying to reach. That&rsquo;s the starting point. We need to find more of those places where our values intersect with broader, cultural values.&nbsp;</div>

Fighting for Environmental Justice,3/27/2018,"<p><em><strong>By: Hon. Donna Bullock</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>PennFuture is honoring Bullock, PA House of Representatives, Philadelphia County, as the Woman of Environmental Justice for her work in representing and protecting citizens disproportionately affected by pollution and environmental impacts, and for her support of expanding green jobs. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">She will be given this award at the Fourth Annual Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards on April 19.</a></strong></em></p>

<p>My name is State Representative Donna Bullock, and I represent the 195th Legislative District, which includes parts of North and West Philadelphia. I am honored to be included among the women being recognized as one of PennFuture&rsquo;s 2018 Women in Conservation.</p>

<p>Prior to being an elected official, I had very little engagement in environmental issues.&nbsp;Like many parents, I wanted my children to live healthy lives, breathe fresh air, and drink clean water, but I didn&rsquo;t know about the hidden toxins that were present in our homes, our relatives&#39; homes, their schools and daycare centers, and even the local playgrounds.</p>

<p>Then, I read a report about lead poisoning in Philadelphia, and specifically about my neighborhood of Strawberry Mansion, where 21 percent&nbsp;of the children tested had lead poisoning.&nbsp;And I thought about my own son, who was previously tested to have lead in his blood. All at once, I was relieved and infuriated.&nbsp;Relieved to know that it wasn&rsquo;t my fault that he was exposed to lead (lead is so ever-present in Philadelphia, that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to escape it), but also angry to know that so many children in my neighborhood were impacted.</p>

<p>And then I thought about the rooms where environmental policy is being discussed and how much these rooms lacked diversity, how the voices of communities like Strawberry Mansion are not at the table.&nbsp;But let&rsquo;s be clear, even if we aren&rsquo;t always at the policy table, we care about the environment and how it impacts our public health, our access to affordable, renewable energy, our access to affordable, sustainable food, and our inclusion in the green economy.</p>

<p>When it comes to confronting the challenges of pollution and climate change, cities and communities of color are often on the front lines.&nbsp;In addition to high levels of lead poisoning, our children also have high rates of asthma.&nbsp;We often live near, and have been exposed to air and water pollution from&nbsp;power plants, factories, and incinerators.&nbsp; Our communities are also less likely to recover from climate-caused disasters.&nbsp;Consider the disparity in our government&rsquo;s response during the recovery efforts of Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Maria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is why communities of color overwhelmingly support&nbsp;measures to protect the environment.&nbsp;According to a poll conducted by the National Resources Defense Council, two-thirds of African-Americans viewed global warming as a serious problem, and 83 percent supported the Clean Power Plan&rsquo;s proposed limits on carbon production from coal and gas fired power plants. The poll also found that most African-Americans think that the reduction of carbon pollution will create more&nbsp;and healthier&nbsp;jobs in renewable, wind and solar energy.&nbsp;According to a similar survey conducted by the Sierra Club and GreenLatinos, 89 percent&nbsp;of the Latinos surveyed reported that the environment and pollution impact their family&rsquo;s quality of life, and 82 percent&nbsp;would prefer that the U.S. invest more in clean, renewable energy sources over fossil fuels.</p>

<p>As a legislator, I use my position to create spaces for communities that are disproportionately impacted by bad environment and energy decisions to have a voice, and to have a seat at the policy table.&nbsp;I have hosted community mixers and panel discussions with diverse stakeholders, and I hope to use the information sessions to inform and shape policy in Harrisburg - policy that would protect families like mine in Strawberry Mansion, and many others throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

A Lifetime of Leadership in Energy Efficiency Advocacy: Women in Conservation,3/27/2018,"<p><em><strong>By: Liz Robinson</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Liz is being presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">PennFuture&rsquo;s Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards</a> event for her work as founder and former executive director of the Energy Coordinating Agency, where she served for 33 years; for her work as the co-founder and first director of the Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance, and for her current accomplishments as executive director of the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association.</strong></em></p>

<p>I began my career as a teacher, in both public and private schools, but moved quickly to community organizing and human services, landing in homeless services.&nbsp;After three years as the director of a homeless shelter, I realized that I&rsquo;d much rather be preventing problems than band-aiding them.&nbsp;I also realized that energy costs were one of the few basic needs that low income residents could actually control.&nbsp;My love of nature and commitment to preserving the environment led me to low income energy services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Philadelphia in the early 1980&rsquo;s was in the throes of a full blown energy and poverty crisis.&nbsp;Philadelphia Gas Works went from shutting off 3,000 customers a year to shutting off 30,000 for nonpayment in one year.&nbsp;Entire blocks were left without power.&nbsp;Unfortunately, PGW considered these customers &ldquo;deadbeats&rdquo; and refused to meet with the advocates defending them.&nbsp;I went to the mayor and to the religious leadership and asked them to broker a dialogue with PGW.&nbsp;We formed an Energy/Poverty Task Force, and undertook a yearlong research effort to analyze Philadelphia&rsquo;s low income energy problem for the first time. The task force then convened a broad range of public/private stakeholders to develop comprehensive, lasting solutions.</p>

<p>Thus, the Energy Coordinating Agency was established in 1984 to coordinate all low income energy services, streamline access, build capacity, and develop systems to insure high quality and accountability.&nbsp;The delivery system had to be grassroots, so we created the citywide network of Neighborhood Energy Centers, a system which has since been replicated in Delaware. The cornerstone of the system was and remains energy conservation and efficiency, accompanied by strong self-help energy education to enable low income households to reduce their usage to affordable levels.&nbsp; I was hired as ECA&rsquo;s first executive director and remained in the role until August of 2017.</p>

<p>In the mid 1990&rsquo;s, the restructuring of the utility industry created many opportunities for clean energy.&nbsp;Together with advocates statewide, I worked to put in place the policy frameworks for both the energy efficiency and solar industries in the Keystone state.&nbsp;I contributed to a number of key accomplishments, including the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, the first net metering tariff, the first training for solar photovoltaic professionals, the first clean energy education campaign, and Act 129. In this process, I worked very closely with a small group of advocates to establish the Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance (KEEA) and its sister organization, the KEEA Energy Education Fund (KEEF).&nbsp;KEEA is the trade association for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s energy efficiency industry.</p>

<p>One of ECA&rsquo;s great contributions has consistently been to use its nimbleness as a nonprofit to convene the stakeholders, and create the structures and institutions that are needed to advance the clean energy industry in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;ECA also managed the Energy Cooperative Association of Philadelphia, transforming it from a city-based oil coop into a statewide renewable energy cooperative, growing ECAP overnight from 700 to 7000 members.</p>

<p>ECA is now focused on developing the highly skilled and diverse workforce of local men and women so desperately needed to fill jobs in the rapidly growing energy efficiency and solar energy industries.</p>

<p>I am now consulting with a few organizations, one of which is the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association.&nbsp;PSEA is a fabulous local group which has been sponsoring the Junior Solar Sprint for 25 years.&nbsp;Through the Junior Solar Sprint,&nbsp; 5th through&nbsp; 8th graders design, build and race model solar cars, and have a great deal of fun in the process!&nbsp; Come join us for this amazing event on Saturday, May 19th at 9 am on the Drexel Campus at 31st and Market Streets.</p>

<p>Philadelphia has finally begun to make strides toward its goal of becoming a sustainable city, but the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is lagging behind again. State legislators need to understand that their goals of economic prosperity and good-paying jobs for Pennsylvanians can most rapidly be met by investing in energy efficiency and solar. These are the cleanest energy resources, energy efficiency is the cheapest, and solar is now competitive with conventional supplies, both are found in abundance statewide, and they create more jobs than any other energy resources.&nbsp;With climate change well underway, none of us has a moment to lose.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for this award.&nbsp;It is truly an honor.</p>

Protecting the Delaware River: Women in Conservation,3/27/2018,"<p><em><strong>By: Jaclyn Rhoads</strong></em></p>

<p><strong><em>Jaclyn is being honored at <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">PennFuture&#39;s Fourth Annual Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards</a>&nbsp;for her work in the Delaware River Watershed through leadership roles with Darby Creek Valley Association, Friends of the Heinz Refuge, and for her work as assistant executive director of Pinelands Preservation Alliance.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>My name is Jaclyn Rhoads.&nbsp;I wear many hats in the environmental community. If I am on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River, I am the assistant executive director of Pinelands Preservation Alliance, a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization dedicated to the protection of the Pinelands National Reserve.&nbsp;In Pennsylvania, where I live, I serve as president of the Friends of the Heinz Refuge and the Darby Creek Valley Association, two awesome nonprofits that have functioned for more than 20 years with all volunteers.&nbsp;I became involved in conservation when I started college in my hometown of Philadelphia.&nbsp;My family didn&rsquo;t travel much, yet I was fascinated with the natural environment. My father was and continues to bug everyone about conserving energy and water, since he was born during the depression.&nbsp;I believe this somehow directed me towards environmental advocacy.</p>

<p>Every day, I work on a variety of environmental issues from climate change to green stormwater infrastructure, but most of my work centers around our water resources.&nbsp;The Delaware River watershed doesn&rsquo;t share the same glamour or federal resources like the Chesapeake Bay or Great Lakes, but it is a unique and essential resource to the residential and ecological communities it serves.&nbsp;A combination of preservation of lands, restoration of poor stormwater infrastructure, education of the general public, and strong policies can return this great river to a source of fishing and recreation, even in the most stressed reaches, which is a big focus for all of the organizations that I am involved with.</p>

<p>Although the restoration of the Delaware River is very important to me, I am most concerned about society&rsquo;s lack of environmental ethics.&nbsp;I hope that my work to get people involved in protecting our natural resources will help to establish the connection between our built environment and the natural environment, which is missing.&nbsp;I strive in all that I do to remind people why it is important that we address climate change, that we build rain gardens, that we have strong policies for stopping pollution, and that we just care about what has been created for us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love the work that I do, and I am thankful to those who want to recognize my efforts, but my greatest reward is being supported by dozens of environmental advocates where I work and volunteer.&nbsp;This award is a symbol of all the great work that so many people do daily, and my hope for the future is that the number of individuals who volunteer, donate, and educate the next generation about environmental conservation will significantly grow, and that the next generation of political leaders puts the environment high on its priority list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We need people, and I don&rsquo;t just mean individuals wanting to get paid to do this work, but people who want to give up their free time and invest in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

A Lifetime of Land Protection: Women in Conservation,3/27/2018,"<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/dulcie%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 889px;"" /></p>

<p><em><strong>By: Dulcie F. Flaharty</strong></em></p>

<p><strong><em>Dulcie recently retired from Natural Lands, where she served as Vice President of Community Partnerships in Southeast Pa. She has worked in land conservation for years and previously served as executive director of Montgomery County Lands Trust. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">She will be honored with a Woman of Lifetime Achievement Award on April 19 in Philadelphia, at PennFuture&#39;s Fourth Annual Celebrating Women in Conservation Awards.</a></em></strong></p>

<p>I have yet to meet a baby conservationist. We are not born with a game plan to identify, protect, and enhance Mother Nature&rsquo;s loveliest and most critical places. At differing times, for varied reasons, this work, this passion gets buried in our hearts, harnesses our intellect and our dreams, intertwines our vocations and avocations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Luckily for me, any strategic plan I may have had for my life was written in pencil&hellip;and I always carry an eraser.</p>

<p>Accepting a Lifetime Achievement Award from PennFuture found its way on to my menu of gratifying experiences. It is an unexpected and much appreciated gift from the conservation community that it is a privilege to work among. They are skilled and tireless professionals. We met as colleagues, bonded as partners and celebrated successes and dealt with setbacks as loyal friends.</p>

<p>Having recently retired from Natural Lands, after 20 years as the founding executive of Montgomery County Lands Trust, I have had a chance to consider how a woman trained as an art historian found a career in land conservation and community connections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Born in Philadelphia, I chose to attend Northwestern University, to taste a bit of the Midwest and foster an interest in architecture and painting through a curriculum in Art History. I returned to the area and received my degree at Temple University.</p>

<p>Land preservation found me 25&nbsp;years ago, when a bold group of Montgomery County leaders determined that they could emulate the Chester County open space efforts.&nbsp;Together, they approached county commissioners with a finely crafted program to save land in the county, requesting a $100 million budget over ten years.</p>

<p>Wise leaders determined that a big budget alone would not assure success; a grassroots, on the ground organization had to be created to work with decision makers. The goal was to help foster smart choices, to determine where to make preservation investment, and how to arrange the inevitable growth coming to our region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was given the chance in 1993 to help build a county nonprofit land trust, Montgomery County Lands Trust, to work hand and glove with the county to insure that the Open Space Program reached all municipalities. Bringing land protection organizations, watershed groups and local conservation supporters into a collaborating assemblage was a goal.</p>

<p>We prioritized community-centric, policy-supported projects. If the policy wasn&rsquo;t there, we worked with elected officials to develop it. Earning trust and gaining respect from decision makers and private citizens was a hallmark of our efforts. Strong relationships developed with state and local elected leaders who recognized that our projects were bipartisan and added value to their communities. Traditional metrics for success piled up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the next 25 years, with the invaluable help of land trust leaders, supportive county and local elected officials, generous state funding entities and a remarkably&nbsp;diverse group of citizens, thousands of acres of natural resource land was protected, miles of trails were built throughout the regions, and agriculturally productive land was safeguarded for generations to come.&nbsp;Working in 2003 with established partnership groups and cultivated community leaders, we spearheaded a $150 million ballot campaign which received voter approval at 78 percent.&nbsp;A municipal education program, Green Futures, was designed to help educate and inform over 1,700 local leaders regarding smart growth and conservation decision making.</p>

<p>Yes, there were acres saved and the dollars raised&hellip;.but it was the authentic, heartwarming stories of the open space heroes who worked on projects in their communities and the families who permanently protected their family lands that powered our work.</p>

<p>My commitment to conservation efforts comes from a strong desire to communicate and connect with people around a unifying concept.&nbsp;Rallying diverse communities and interest groups, I remain confident that people find a deep connection and affection for the places in which they live. Those places look and feel different, but harnessing that common affection brings power and focus to collaboration. Hearing the needs and respecting the unique skills and perspectives of those we strive to motivate and guide remains an imperative component to healthy, productive partnerships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking into the future for opportunities, I believe that the landscapes of our work may change, yet the purpose of our efforts remains constant: green, healthy, connected communities to benefit and be enjoyed by all our citizens. Combining energies with people to identify, protect and enhance those special places in every town and countryside remains a great privilege and ongoing joy.</p>

<p>We must never forget to infuse our work with joy and with heart. And together, we bring Mother Nature the field operation that will protect our most special places.</p>

The Importance of Women Leading the Way in Southeast PA,3/27/2018,"<p><strong>We are excited to share our <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/blog"">latest blogs with you&nbsp;</a>as we highlight the contributions of Pennsylvania women working on behalf of our environment.&nbsp;</strong>We are at a critical time when big decisions are being made that will influence the trajectory of our climate future, and what pathways to clean air, water and clean energy will look like going forward.&nbsp;<strong>As we approach Thursday, April 19, the evening in Philadelphia when PennFuture will honor these women and their work at our <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2018221womeninconservationawardstickets/index.html"">Celebrating Women in Conservation&nbsp;Awards</a>, I am reminded that never before have we needed the voices of these women, and of all the others we know are out there doing good work.</strong> We thank and honor all of them and hope to see some of you in Philly at the event.</p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/blog""><strong>In our latest series of blogs, our honorees are sharing their stories.</strong></a> This year&rsquo;s honorees all come from southeast Pennsylvania, but their experiences are vastly different, spanning work with the White House to the neighbor&rsquo;s house. But a commonality among them is their passion for the work, commitment to enlisting others into advocacy at this important time, and their dedication to their communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think of the road I have traveled since becoming involved in environmental work in 1983 as a Sierra Club volunteer where I was able to build a large coalition of&nbsp; hunters, anglers, recreationists, scientists and others who collectively stopped the damming of a high quality cold water fishery in northeast Pennsylvania called Nescopeck Creek. It was a fight that lasted 15 years, and I continued the work during my time at National Wildlife Federation.&nbsp; I was lucky to find the Sierra Club and luckier to find work in a profession that called to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As PennFuture&rsquo;s sixth president and CEO, I&rsquo;m the third woman to hold that position in the organization, following in the footsteps of founding president and CEO John Hanger, who was followed by George Jugovic, Jan Jarrett, Cindy Dunn and Larry Schweiger.&nbsp;</strong> PennFuture has had four board chairs over our roughly 20 year history, beginning with founding board chair R. John Dawes, Jr., followed by Joy Kauffman, David Lane and now Char Magaro. So, the organization has had a gender balance of leadership on both the staff and volunteer leadership side, with many, many other talented and committed individuals as part of our organization now, or who were in the past.</p>

<p>I am sure that all of our honorees had the help of a great many people as part of their stories &ndash; families, mentors, teachers, partner organizations who ascribed value to these individuals.&nbsp; I am sure all found inspiration, perhaps from nature herself, or motivation from their children&rsquo;s or&nbsp; communities&rsquo; health that compelled action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not everyone&rsquo;s story will look the same but we all have a part to play.&nbsp;For some, making a meaningful life will be a solitary and quiet endeavor, and a pat on the back will never be felt, or expected.&nbsp;It feels important to keep this in mind as today&rsquo;s world calls on all of us to do more for the people and places we care about.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Clean Water and Responsible Development are a Natural in the Poconos,3/20/2018,"<p><em><strong>This opinion piece was published in the March 18, 2018 edition of the Pocono Record.</strong></em></p>

<p>The streams, forests and mountains of the Poconos are nothing short of legendary, and these natural jewels have enabled businesses and tourism to flourish for decades.</p>

<p>This is why - as the state&rsquo;s watchdog for clean air, pure water, and a healthy climate - PennFuture finds it important to respond to the Feb. 16 full-page ad in the Pocono Record, that decries, rather than celebrates, the state&rsquo;s recognition that area streams have exceptional water quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is easy for citizens to be fooled by the false choice between economic development and a clean environment. It&rsquo;s a trap that polarizes communities into endless disagreements when, in fact, the history of this very region demonstrates that a clean environment, properly respected, promotes economic development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The history of the Poconos is a history of residents that have viewed nature as an integral part of our community, to be used with love and respect, rather than as a commodity to be consumed with no effect on our community. Our foresight in protecting and respecting the environment is what has enabled businesses to draw millions of dollars to the local economy. Visitors come to ski in our mountains, fish in our streams, camp in our parks and walk on our trails. These visitors support local business because of the natural environment, not in spite of it.&nbsp;Famed conservationist Aldo Leopold referred to this view of nature as the land ethic, a philosophy that simply recognizes the interdependence between people and nature &ndash; that we, the land and men and women, are part of the same community.</p>

<p>The Poconos has served as a peaceful escape for everything that nature offers: places for quiet contemplation, vigorous hiking, thrilling hunting, and other activities that allow families to laugh, explore and play. Water slides, zip lines and ski slopes have flourished because of the surrounding natural environment. There is no need to choose between conservation of the environment and growth of our economy: we can have both.&nbsp;For that reason, our community should continue to celebrate protection of our streams, and firmly reject the notion that our community should be developed separately and apart from protection of our environment.&nbsp;We need both.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through our Poconos office and staff, PennFuture looks forward to working with local business owners to build relationships and shared goals that will contribute to the natural beauty of our area, and successful, responsible development in the Poconos.</p>

Join Tonight’s Lehigh Valley Watershed Listening Session,3/12/2018,"<p>Tonight, PennFuture is holding the second of three watershed listening sessions in the Delaware River Basin at Fegley&rsquo;s Brew Works in Bethlehem from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.&nbsp;In October 2017, the first listening session was held in the Poconos, and the final session will be held in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will start off the night with introductions from the PennFuture staff and acknowledgement of our new office, located in Mt. Pocono. This office services Northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Delaware River Basin. Our discussion and presentations will be led by PennFuture&rsquo;s Northeast PA staff, including our Staff Attorney Abby Jones, and myself, as I serve as PennFuture&rsquo;s Northeast PA Outreach Coordinator. Watershed groups, other environmental organizations, and volunteers will also have the chance to meet members of PennFuture&rsquo;s Philadelphia staff, including Director of Outreach Jay Andrews, Ph.D., Southeast PA Outreach Coordinator Alex Cupo, and Staff Attorney Alice Baker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After introductions, a short presentation about how PennFuture can help local environmental groups and watershed organizations in the areas with outreach, policy, and legal work will occur, and then we will open the floor to attendees for input on how we can partner in the Lehigh Valley community. Attendees at this session will focus on groups placed in the counties of Lehigh, Northampton, Carbon, Schuylkill, Berks, and southern Monroe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our goal for the Lehigh Valley watershed listening session is to learn more about different environmental organizations efforts, trials, and triumphs to address critical environmental and water quality issues in the region. PennFuture is proud to work with new partners and we look forward to contributing our expertise to the Lehigh Valley, as well as across the state of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Come, mingle, and tell us what you think. Please contact me with any questions at 570-216-3344 or at rinaldi@pennfuture.org.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Tonight&rsquo;s Lehigh Valley listening session will be held at Fegley&rsquo;s Brew Works&rsquo; downstairs lounge in Bethlehem from 5 to 7 p.m. The address is 559 Main Street #101, Bethlehem, PA 18018.&nbsp;</em></p>

New Permit Better Controls Pollution from Stormwater Runoff,3/12/2018,"<p>It may be hard to believe, but stormwater, rain and snow melt running off of pavements that are covered by impenetrable materials such as asphalt, concrete, brick, stone&mdash;and rooftops, are&nbsp;significant causes of water pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the stormwater runs over these impervious surfaces, it collects pollutants, including oil, pesticides, sediment, and bacteria.&nbsp; Untreated stormwater runoff entering our streams can result in the contamination of our drinking water supplies; prohibitions on swimming, fishing or boating uses; injury or death to aquatic plants and animals; dangers to public health; and increased flooding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In many places, this stormwater runoff is conveyed through distinct sewer pipes that bypass the wastewater treatment plants and discharge the polluted runoff directly into our streams and lakes. This system is known as a &ldquo;municipal separate storm sewer system&rdquo; or MS4.</p>

<p>Luckily, there are laws that protect our waters from polluted stormwater runoff. For example, stormwater from MS4 in urbanized areas is controlled through a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit under the federal Clean Water Act.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) implements this program and issues permits allowing the discharge as long as the permittee complies with the permit requirements. PADEP issued its first general permit for MS4s in 2003. Although each permit is only supposed to be effective for five years, the PADEP&rsquo;s second MS4 general permit did not become effective until 2013.</p>

<p>Even then, after more than 10 years of the program&rsquo;s implementation, this second MS4 permit was woefully insufficient.&nbsp;<strong>PennFuture took issue with the inadequacy of the PADEP&rsquo;s MS4 program and filed an appeal of PADEP&rsquo;s approval of coverage under the MS4 general permit for Upper Gwynedd Township.&nbsp;</strong> (PA Environmental Hearing Board Docket No. 2013-105-L). <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/cases"">You can read more about PennFuture&rsquo;s claims here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>After more than a year of negotiations, PennFuture and PADEP entered into a settlement which addressed PennFuture&rsquo;s most important objections, including providing an opportunity for public participation and requiring a demonstration that determined pollution reductions would occur.&nbsp; As a result of PennFuture&rsquo;s challenge, the subsequent permit is much more protective of our waters. This new, more protective permit goes into effect this Friday, March 16.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The new permit includes the six minimum controls of public education and outreach on stormwater, public involvement and participation, illicit discharge detection and elimination, construction site stormwater runoff control, post-construction stormwater management, pollution prevention and good housekeeping of municipal operations.</p>

<p>The PADEP 2018 general permit also requires MS4 permittees discharging into waters impaired as a result of sediment and nutrient pollution to include a plan on how to achieve reductions in these pollutants over the five year term of the permit. Implementation of these plans to reduce pollutants will advance Pennsylvania&rsquo;s efforts to reach pollutant reduction targets in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, PADEP has reviewed these plans for sufficiency and compliance with the permit requirements.&nbsp; We have high hopes that the 2018 permit will help protect and improve Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waters and look forward to working with PADEP and municipalities alike to ensure the permit is appropriately implemented.&nbsp;</p>

“4TheDelaware” Campaign Asks Governors to Step Up for the Delaware River Watershed,3/7/2018,"<p>Pennsylvania is among four states that include portions of the Delaware River Basin, along with New Jersey, Delaware, and New York. In Pennsylvania, 17 of the state&rsquo;s 67 counties lie entirely or partly within the Delaware River watershed. In 2010, <a href=""http://www.docs.dcnr.pa.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_20031252.pdf"" target=""_blank"">according to the PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</a>, nearly 5 million people lived within Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion of the watershed. That number has certainly grown since.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture, the Delaware Nature Society, Friends of the Upper Delaware, and New Jersey Audubon, are now working together with our partner, the National Wildlife Federation, to lead the 4TheDelaware Campaign, urging state leaders to advance and expand support for this critical watershed.</strong></p>

<p>The Delaware River provides drinking water to residents both within and outside of the watershed and supports local economies along its banks in cities like Philadelphia and the many towns in the region. The river also provides millions of jobs (<a href=""http://www.state.nj.us/drbc/library/documents/SocioeconomicValueDRB-UDEL-FinalRpt.pdf"" target=""_blank"">accounting for approximately $115.5 billion in wages in 2011</a>) in the state including outdoor recreation, farming, water supply and wastewater utilities, and watershed organizations. It is a resource that plays a crucial role supporting public health as well as the regional economy. By prioritizing the Delaware, leaders can prove that good jobs and a healthy environment go hand in hand.</p>

<p>We are joining together as organizations across four states to call on the governors of Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York, and New Jersey to take a stand and defend the river&rsquo;s health, protect the thriving economy that relies on the Delaware River watershed, and safeguard the animal and plant life essential to the ecological health of the region and the river.</p>

<p>Restoration programs established by environmental organizations, the Pennsylvania Game Commission, and the federal government have been successful in bringing bald eagles and <a href=""http://www.philly.com/philly/health/shad-make-strong-comeback-in-delaware-river-20171030.html"" target=""_blank"">river shad back</a> to the Delaware River, <a href=""http://www.state.nj.us/drbc/edweb/bald-eagle.html"" target=""_blank"">where they had nearly disappeared entirely</a>. This is a promising sign of restoration, but there is much more to be done to ensure regional progress. The Delaware River is home to several endangered species, and fish and wildlife rely on the watershed for habitat and food. With such precious wildlife at stake, it is especially critical for Pennsylvania to protect the diverse ecosystems that support the Delaware River.</p>

<p>Through the work of our incredible supporters, the commitment from our legislators, and the thoughtful leadership from our business partners, we can restore the Delaware River, protect the region for generations to come, and preserve it for the families and wildlife that all call this watershed home.</p>

<p>Join us as we kick off this great campaign to make the Delaware River watershed the model for a fully restored and vibrant watershed!</p>

Shop for Clean Energy & Take the Power Back,3/5/2018,"<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/Take%2Dthe%2DPower%2DBack%2DSocial%2DMedia%2DImage%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 476px; height: 249px;"" /></p>

<p>Clean renewable energy is a growing success story. A recent report on the electric power industry from the federal <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_es1b"" target=""_blank"">Energy Information Administration</a> showed that non-hydro renewable energy grew 13.4 percent year-over-year in 2017. Of that, solar power grew at an impressive 46.9 percent. While clean energy was growing, fossil fuels were in a slump with coal generation down -2.5 percent and natural gas generation dropping -7.7 percent.</p>

<p>This trend shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. <a href=""https://www.lazard.com/media/438038/levelized-cost-of-energy-v100.pdf"" target=""_blank"">A recent study shows</a> the cost of generating solar electricity from large solar farms&nbsp; dropped 11 percent last year, and the cost of rooftop solar dropped 26 percent. For those of us in Pennsylvania who want to install a solar system, the drop in prices is good news. At least, it is good news if you are lucky enough to live in a location where you can buy or lease a solar system for your rooftop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this still isn&rsquo;t an option for many Pennsylvanians. The cost of solar systems is certainly a factor, but many families lack a good location for solar power. Families who rent or live in multi-family units face particular challenges, but even those who own their own single-family homes need property that isn&rsquo;t in the shade, that has suitable wiring, and a roof that is both big enough and strong enough for the installation. As a result, maybe 50 percent or more of Pennsylvania families lack meaningful access to solar generation during the present time. Some states have &ldquo;community solar&rdquo; laws that allow customers to buy a share of a solar system and have the generation deducted from their bill, just like they would if the panels were on their roof. Unfortunately, the legislation in Pennsylvania hasn&rsquo;t progressed that far and most families also lack this as a viable option.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not surprising that Pennsylvania consumers may feel trapped into buying energy from dirty fossil fuel companies. But, there is still an option for many of us: Pennsylvania is one of the 17 states and the District of Columbia that has a retail electric choice program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/takethepowerback"" target=""_blank""><strong>This is why PennFuture recently launched the Take the Power Back campaign</strong></a> to help make consumers aware that they have the power of choice, and that choosing clean energy can be easy. We want to start the conversation about the benefits of switching to clean energy as an investment in our future. If you can generate your own clean energy, that is fantastic. If not, making the switch to buying clean energy is the next best choice: <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/TakethePowerBack_Steps-to-Take-for-Parents.pdf"" target=""_blank"">our website shows you how.</a></p>

<p>Most Pennsylvanians have a regulated utility that delivers electricity to their homes, but those utilities are basically delivery companies. They don&rsquo;t own the power plants and they are not in the business of selling electricity. <strong>If we don&rsquo;t choose to shop for power, they will do the shopping for us - but the choice is ours.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>This means that if you are tired of waiting for the government to get serious about climate change, or if you are frustrated at the amount of tax breaks and other handouts that are given to the fossil fuel industry, you don&rsquo;t have to wait for someone else to act.</strong>&nbsp;You can make the choice to buy clean energy. In many cases you can even save money in the process.</p>

<p>If you already made the switch to buying clean energy, you can be a part of the conversation, too. While most Pennsylvania businesses already shop for electricity, comparatively few residential customers have taken advantage of consumer electric choice. We need your help to spread the word that we can #TakeThePowerBack.</p>

A New Role as Policy Director,2/28/2018,"<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve lived, worked, and organized in rural Pennsylvania to support organizations and causes that impact our everyday lives, including the Boy Scouts, prison reform, and clean water. Recently, I moved into a new role at PennFuture as Director of Policy. I&rsquo;m excited to continue advocating for communities around the Commonwealth that want a clean environment and strong ecology for themselves, as well as their children, friends, and family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long desired to work in environmental and conservation policy to save the resources I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with over the years. Growing up, I spent countless hours on my family&rsquo;s farm property and became intimately familiar with the forested and mountain landscapes of Penn&rsquo;s Woods. My worldview has been indelibly shaped by memories of learning to swim in the Juniata with my father, fishing in the Conococheague, and&nbsp;today, I continue to enjoy kayaking the Yellow Breeches and backpacking the Appalachian Trail. It&rsquo;s these experiences I believe my six-year-old and two-year-old nephews should also have some day. These experiences should be available for all Pennsylvanians.</p>

<p>But, these waterways and land won&rsquo;t be preserved from degradation without organizations like PennFuture building relationships with and holding accountable state and federal legislators.</p>

<p>It is essential I keep my finger on the pulse of moving issues and that PennFuture regularly weighs in on policy matters in both Harrisburg and Washington.&nbsp;As PennFuture&rsquo;s chief lobbyist, I&rsquo;m on the front lines of a battle being waged to defund our parks, farmlands, trails and water, and a battle against our state agencies&rsquo; power to enforce strong laws and regulations over polluters.</p>

<p>From early on and through my professional work, I&rsquo;ve held an inner conviction to defend the powerless and advance justice wherever I can. As an advocate for our clean air, water, and climate, I&rsquo;m called to speak out. Speaking our truths to those in power helps us imagine and create the world in which we want to live. I want to live in a community where my drinking water is protected, forest land is conserved, animal species are saved, and the ability to breathe without fear of pollution is realized. My work means believing deeply in what we say and fighting for our voices to be heard in every legislative and executive office PennFuture engages. My raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre is to increase public participation in government at all levels, to advance government for the common good by increasing stakeholder engagement in all public decisions, and to look out for the people of Pennsylvania during policy debates and budget negotiations. Sometimes these positions aren&rsquo;t popular and might mean taking a risk, but, to me, that&rsquo;s what it means to stand up for something.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>We face formidable challenges and opportunities on the road ahead. More troubling is that we live in a rapidly changing political landscape that, at times, threatens our basic laws for the stewardship of our environment. It is important, now more than ever, that PennFuture serve as the watchdog in our statehouse, Congress, and municipalities and that we all do our best to preserve and restore our environmental protections. I&rsquo;m happy to be a part of this team and driving the policy work, day to day, for our members and all Pennsylvanians.</p>

False Choices: Why PA Doesn’t Need to Sell Out Health for Dirty Energy Jobs,2/28/2018,"<p>Since its founding 20 years ago, PennFuture has occupied a unique space in the state, from brokering the most significant policy victories advancing clean energy, to prevailing in legal cases we&rsquo;ve brought on behalf of communities and individuals fighting for their rights to clean air and pure water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This element of accountability has been a common thread weaving through PennFuture&rsquo;s lifespan, and it extends to elected officials, state and federal agencies, and corporate interests whose actions stymy our work on behalf of our constituents, and our mission to protect the environment. In our view, the environment is not a special interest, it is everyone&rsquo;s interest.</p>

<p><strong>We have been compelled to extend that accountability to officials in Harrisburg and question why the environment continues to be an almost invisible issue among so many of them.</strong> To be certain, there are a handful of state legislators who lead on environmental issues, but they are outnumbered by those who are anti-environmental and anti-regulatory in their votes, actions and words.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvanians are concerned about their environment. On Jan. 30, PennFuture, the Breathe Collaborative and leading activists from Allegheny and Beaver counties held a press conference and rally in Pittsburgh to oppose the buildout of the petrochemical industry in western Pennsylvania. Afterwards, our <a href=""http://www.toxicneighbor.org"">Toxic Neighbor petitions</a>, signed by more than 3,000 Pennsylvanians opposed to Shell Appalachia&rsquo;s $6 billion ethane cracker in Beaver County, were delivered to the governor, state, federal and local legislators and Pittsburgh Regional Alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of these petition recipients champion the &ldquo;petchem&rdquo; industry and its promise of jobs. While we acknowledge the opportunity that natural gas under our feet represents when it is exploited, what is the cost of that exploitation and those jobs in terms of taxpayer subsidies, risks to public health, decimation of our forests and streams, and insults to our climate?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We seek leadership from our policymakers, particularly around creating and supporting opportunities to develop technologies, good paying jobs and our workforce around the clean energy sector.</strong>&nbsp;According to January 2017&rsquo;s U.S. Energy and Employment report, more than 62,000 Pennsylvanians already work in energy efficiency, and more than 7,000 work in solar and wind electric generation.<strong> Imagine the economic growth that would result from state elected officials leveling the playing field and offering similar policy support to clean energy industries that will not pollute the air your children breathe. </strong>This support is currently provided to polluting industries. We need and deserve leaders who will no longer force voters to choose between pure water to drink - or more jobs. In 2018, we can have both, and we must demand it before it is too late. If Shell is given a $1.65 billion tax break to pollute southwest Pennsylvania in exchange for jobs, why is the same investment not going into clean energy industries? Tax payers deserve better than the threat of increased asthma and cancer rates. Pennsylvania must choose to be a part of the clean energy future that many other states are pursuing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible for us to conjecture who among our elected officials will step up and lead in the arena of clean air, healthy climate and a new clean energy economy, but it is within our power to use our voices and our votes to say loud and clear that leadership among our elected officials is sorely missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, like so much of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s long history, the modern day coal barons of the natural gas industry have captured many of the institutions that drive economic development in the state, and while it appears to be succeeding beyond all expectations, it is nowhere near finished taking advantage of the hospitable welcome it has received in the form of government subsidies, benevolent permitting and friends in government extolling its virtues and enjoying campaign contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture and our allies are championing clean energy as a growth area for economic development and one that will not sentence our people, natural resources and climate to a future that looks poised to replicate the pollution and health impacts we&rsquo;ve experienced as a result of our fossil fueled past.&nbsp; We do not need to repeat history when we have better options for the future.</p>

Public Engagement is Key to Pennsylvania’s Clean Water Goals,2/21/2018,"<p>A year from this month, the final draft of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan will be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for final review, approval, and enactment. Before that happens, though, a lot of work is set to take place in the coming months. As important as this document is, and its next steps for making sure Pennsylvania meets its pollution reduction goals by 2025, none of this can happen without you.</p>

<p>Conversations during January&rsquo;s meeting of the Steering Committee for the Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) began to lay out the Pennsylvania&nbsp;Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s public engagement strategy and communications around the importance of executing the important work of the WIP. To underscore this need, a new report out earlier this year reminded Pennsylvania policymakers that our Commonwealth has almost 20,000 miles of impaired streams, creeks, and rivers. Instead of focusing narrowly on the Chesapeake Bay, Pennsylvania and the WIP should focus on cleaning its local waters, which will, in sum, restore the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>Local governments, planning commissions, county commissioners, township supervisors, and state legislators, will be critical to include in these discussions and buy-in moving forward and Pennsylvania agencies should work closely with nongovernmental and nonprofit organizations working in the field to reach all of the stakeholders.</p>

<p>We recommend DEP and its Steering Committee workgroups engage the public extensively to provide needed input and feedback on the draft local planning process. Along with including public-private partnerships and innovative groups and strategies, DEP and the WIP Steering Committee should identify key stakeholders to develop action steps at the local level.</p>

<p>This year, as DEP puts its pen to paper for the Phase III WIP, it should hold a number of hearings, windows for public comments, and several opportunities for Pennsylvanians to stand up for clean water and make their voice heard for strong targets. As the state government rolls out its public engagement strategy, citizens&rsquo; participation will make all the difference.</p>

<p>You have power and you should be at the table in our states&rsquo; decisions on how to cut back our water pollution. Stay tuned for more actions and upcoming opportunities.</p>

I manage all legislative and executive branch relationships as well as public policy decisions and processes for PennFuture.&nbsp;As a member of the senior leadership team, I serve as PennFuture&rsquo;s chief lobbyist and external voice on policy positions, strategy, and relationships with decision makers at the local, state, and federal levels of government. I also have the pleasure of representing PennFuture on the Steering Committee of the Choose Clean Water Coalition.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Prior to serving as director of policy, I worked as PennFuture&rsquo;s Campaign Manager for Watershed Advocacy and state lead for the Choose Clean Water Coalition, where I led high-impact outreach and communications campaigns around clean water issues affecting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and communities in the Susquehanna and Potomac River basins. I focused on the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters, and provided oversight and support of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay plan and the state&rsquo;s Watershed Implementation Plan. I had the chance to work extensively on state and federal issues, including stormwater management, clean water funding, agriculture, forest retention, the Farm Bill, climate change, and water infrastructure, among others. <strong>For more information on my background, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/ezra-thrush"">click here.</a></strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Our 2018 Policy Priorities</strong></div>

<div>With this background, I look forward to continuing and leading the great work of PennFuture in both the state and federal policy spheres. So much is at stake in 2018 and we&rsquo;ve developed a comprehensive suite of policy priorities for our work in Harrisburg and Washington, D.C. this year.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>For clean water, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Push for full funding for Water Commissions. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s share of funding for the Delaware River Basin Commission, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, and the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin Commission have all been cut to dangerously low levels and must be restored to protect these watersheds.</li>
	<li>Push for the creation of a dedicated clean water fund. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waters are in crisis. This fund is crucial for restoration and stewardship projects for our watersheds and we will push for the General Assembly to enact a water usage fee.</li>
	<li>Advocate for increased clean water funding for our resource agencies. We are advocating for reversing decades of program cuts to clean water programs at the Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Department of Agriculture as a part of the 2018-2019 state budget.</li>
	<li>Advocate for the passage of a package of stormwater bills (HBs 913, 914, 915, 916), which allow towns, boroughs, and other municipality types in Pennsylvania the ability to asses stormwater fees. Municipalities can use these monies for implementing critical best management practices to help them meet their clean water requirements and their pollutant reduction plans.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>For land protection, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Advocate for the passage of Growing Greener III legislation. The state&rsquo;s Growing Greener program has funded hundreds of local parks and trail projects, conserved more than 80,000 acres of threatened open space, and restored hundreds of miles of streams and waterways. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Growing Greener program has also protected thousands of acres of farmland and reclamation of abandoned mine land.</li>
	<li>Oppose any attempt to reverse Governor Wolf&rsquo;s moratorium on drilling for oil and gas in our state parks and forest lands.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>For clean air, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Push back against and oppose Shell Global&rsquo;s petrochemical build-out in Beaver County through our Toxic Neighbor&nbsp;campaign.</li>
	<li>Push for setting limits on methane pollution. The Governor has made it a priority to implement regulatory controls on methane pollution from oil and gas operations in 2018. We are working to advance the first part of these controls by May 2018 and begin the final process this year.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>For clean energy, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Support Commercial PACE as it builds momentum. Commercial PACE (C-PACE), which provides new financing mechanisms for municipalities wanting to support commercial buildings becoming more energy efficient, took steps forward in 2017. The bill is cosponsored by nearly two thirds&nbsp;of the state Senate and is poised for passage in 2018.</li>
	<li>Advocate for the passage of the Climate Mitigation Action Act (SB 15 &ndash; Costa). This legislation instructs DEP to develop a carbon reduction program to cut emissions by 30 percent&nbsp;by 2030. It represents the first legislation in Pennsylvania for capping carbon emissions.</li>
	<li>Work with partners to draft and move legislation for community solar in Pennsylvania. Community solar would allow residents who can&rsquo;t install solar panels because of poor building structure or low-income to buy into a joint solar installation and still gain benefits from renewable energy.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>For a responsible State Budget and defense of our protections, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Fight the continued dismantling of DEP. The FY2017-18 state budget cut DEP&rsquo;s budget 7 percent, adding to the 40 percent already cut from DEP&rsquo;s budget during the last ten years. This hollowing out is having tangible impact, as we see fewer inspectors who can ensure water supplies are safe, fewer inspections of oil and gas activity, fewer permit reviewers, and a smaller number of scientists studying new sources of pollution. PennFuture is fighting on the frontlines in Harrisburg to stop and reverse this disturbing trend.</li>
	<li>Oppose all attempts at moving and passing the Regulatory Review bills which are currently in the House State Government Committee (HBs 209, 1237, 1792, 1959, 1960). A suite of bills crafted under the guise of &ldquo;regulatory reform&rdquo; is scheduled for a vote in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives this year that would irreparably harm our environmental agencies ability to protect our health and the environment from pollution. PennFuture is leading a coalition of organizations to defeat these bills.</li>
	<li>Oppose efforts to raid the Environmental Stewardship Fund, Keystone Recreation &amp; Parks Fund, Agriculture Preservation Fund, County Conservation District Fund, and other crucial environmental and energy funds administered by the DEP and DCNR.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Regarding federal policy initiatives, PennFuture will&hellip;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Advocate for a strong 2018 Farm Bill. The Farm Bill represents the key opportunity to drive federal investment in agriculture, water, and land conservation programs. We are leading a coalition effort to push for increased funding across a number of key water and land programs as well as protect the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program.</li>
	<li>Protect and fund the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program (DRBRP), which was created by the Delaware River Basin Conservation Act of 2015 (DRBCA) and was a key legislative victory for PennFuture and its coalition members.</li>
	<li>Advocate for the federal RECLAIM legislation, which would invest over $50 million in new funding for land and water clean-up from legacy coal mining and acid mine drainage in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s coal country.</li>
	<li>Oppose the repeal and replacement of EPA&rsquo;s Clean Water Rule (Waters of the United States). We&rsquo;ve submitted legal and technical comments to the EPA docket to preserve the Rule which protects the drinking water of millions of Americans. PennFuture also collected hundreds of citizen letters for the EPA to stop the roll-back of this critical protection. We are continuing to fight against this move and any subsequent replacement that weakens our clean water safeguards.</li>
	<li>Be a leader in the Renewable Fuel Standard Campaign: The RFS is a federal mandate to blend renewable fuels into conventional gasoline, which had good environmental intentions initially, but ultimately led to significant carbon and land use issues. We are advancing legislation in Congress to fix the RFS and restore its initial environmental intent.</li>
</ul>

<p>With significant challenges and opportunities ahead of us this year, our team is already fast at work and eager to continue holding polluters accountable and pushing for policies and legislation that will make our environment better for all Pennsylvanians.</p>

Air Quality Expo Educates Citizens on Air Pollution,2/13/2018,"<p>PennFuture and Clean Water Action hosted the Third Annual Air Quality Expo at the Squirrel Hill Carnegie Library this month to educate East End Pittsburgh residents about the steady stream of air pollution from the Mon Valley - pointing out that this pollution travels and impacts their lives.</p>

<p>The event kicked off with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPpNlct8Lu0"" target=""_blank"">VICE media&rsquo;s documentary, &ldquo;Steam Valley,&rdquo;</a> in which PennFuture member, Cheryl Hurt, as well as other Clairton residents discuss their day-to-day routines, how they can smell benzene in the air, and how they have learned to master the technique of &ldquo;breathing while running&rdquo; in order to participate in local sports. Residents also discussed dealing with the alarming rates of childhood asthma in the area.</p>

<p>The degradation of air quality that many in the Mon Valley observe is due to one of the biggest polluters in Allegheny County, U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Clairton Coke Works. In fact, Allegheny County ranks in the top two percent nationally for cancer risk from hazardous air pollutants (<a href=""http://www.chec.pitt.edu/documents/PRETA/CHEC%20PRETA%20HAPs%20Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pittsburgh Regional Environmental Threat Analysis Report, 2013</a>).</p>

<p>The eye-opening documentary shows the disconnect between Pittsburghers who are convinced what comes out of the Clairton Coke Works is purely steam, versus what local public health and air quality experts state is actually spewed from the smokestacks, which includes particulate matter (PM 2.5).&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just Clairton residents who are at risk of these harmful plumes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Dr. Albert Presto, an Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and a member of Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies, who is tracking the path of Mon Valley pollution, these plumes can be as far-reaching as to travel to East End communities like Squirrel Hill.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://breatheproject.org/learn/breathe-mobile/"" target=""_blank"">Using the &ldquo;Breathemobile,&rdquo;</a> Presto collected pollution data throughout Allegheny County and turned this data into a series of color-coded maps that reveal where pollutants are found throughout the county.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Industrial facilities such as the Clairton Coke Works that emit large amounts of pollution can affect communities miles away,&rdquo; Presto states. &ldquo;Pittsburgh&rsquo;s river valleys augment the problem because the emissions can get trapped down there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Deborah Gentile also presented her recent childhood asthma study that is contingent with Presto&rsquo;s work. She found that among 1,200 elementary school children who live near sources of pollution, such as the Clairton Coke Works, about 35 percent have asthma, and two thirds of them, or 24 percent, actually knew they had asthma.</p>

<p>The national asthma rate is about 8 percent and in Allegheny County, it&rsquo;s 13 percent.</p>

<p>Children are more susceptible to the effects of air pollution because, compared to adults, they have a larger lung surface area in relation to their body weight, and breathe about 50 percent more air per kilogram of body weight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gentile states, &ldquo;Near these point sources of pollution, we tend to see more minority families as well as more lower socioeconomic status, and that&rsquo;s what they find in other cities as well. These are the people who can&rsquo;t afford to live elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kids who are exposed to the highest level of particulate matter, as well as the highest level black carbon, are twice as likely to have a diagnosis of asthma than those who are exposed to the lower levels. So, that really has to be a call for public policy change to clean this air up,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>While this all may seem a bit daunting and out of your hands, Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s CREATE Lab would argue otherwise. With their citizen science tools such as the <a href=""http://smellpgh.org/"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;Smell Pgh&rdquo; app</a>, where you can submit real-time data on your location and what kind of industrial smell you are encountering directly to the Allegheny County Health Department, any Pittsburgher (including YOU) can help in holding industry and its regulatory agency, in this case the Allegheny County Health Department, accountable.</p>

<p>In addition to monitoring the air in your community by <a href=""http://breatheproject.org/learn/breathe-cam/"" target=""_blank"">watching the Breathe Cam</a> or renting a <a href=""https://www.specksensor.com/"" target=""_blank"">Speck Sensor</a> from your library, we need you to <a href=""http://www.achd.net/board/meetings.html"" target=""_blank"">speak out to the Allegheny County Health Department Board of Health</a> meetings to voice your concerns and why we all have the right to breathe clean air.&nbsp;</p>

“Art of the Heel” and “Forces of Nature”- Music Supports PennFuture,1/29/2018,"<p>During the 2017 Philadelphia Fringe Festival Sept. 23, PennFuture was the recipient of an amazing benefit concert put on by Cory O&rsquo; Niell Walker, <a href=""https://cookiediorio.com/"" target=""_blank"">also known as Cookie Diorio.</a> Cookie and her musical team, Garrett Obrycki and Matt Brower, held the concert, which was sponsored by the First Unitarian Church&rsquo;s Social Justice Ministry. The concert celebrated &ldquo;Forces of Nature&rdquo; with Cookie&rsquo;s wildly original tunes, in addition to operatic and Broadway favorites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And how Cookie can sing! Cookie is a diverse performer, composer, and designer who performs multiple genres, including opera, musical theater, art song and dance. She holds a Master&#39;s Degree in vocal performance from Ithaca College, where she also studied composition. Cookie also has a popular voice studio in Philadelphia and performs regularly with The Opera Company of Philadelphia and The Mendelssohn Club Chorus.</p>

<p>After Cookie began managing the &ldquo;Art of the Heel,&rdquo; a special star was born. Cookie told me she loves using her 6.5 inch heels to &ldquo;celebrate diversity, promote social justice and create civically engaged art by hosting world class music showcases to benefit nonprofit organizations making a difference in our communities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked Cookie how she thought of the idea to give back to nonprofit organizations through music.&nbsp; Originally, she did not know where to start. She began looking at organizations that shared her values and concerns, but there were so many! Cookie said, &ldquo;It was a learning process for me and I&rsquo;ve learned there is no shame in not knowing all of the answers right away. I am just committed to learning more to make good decisions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Cookie, the next step was this: &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t give a massive donation, how can I put my art together to give back?&nbsp; Yes, I am giving my time and time is valuable. But I can&rsquo;t do this alone. I am so lucky to have friends and colleagues who hold the same beliefs I do.&nbsp; They fully support what I choose and are gracious enough to give their time.&nbsp; They tell me, &lsquo;Give my entire fee to the organization.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This brings us to how she chose PennFuture as the beneficiary for September&rsquo;s concert.&nbsp; Cookie believes in environmental advocacy and learning more about the environmental issues we face in our state.&nbsp; What caught her eye when she checked PennFuture out was, &ldquo;the many ways in which PennFuture works.&rdquo; She was inspired by all of our legislative and legal work. She could not believe how many pieces of legislation go through the General Assembly. She puts that part of our work on the macro level:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The really big things that are important in making a difference.&rdquo; But it was also the other things we do regularly like our outreach team&rsquo;s work on environmental matters that also impressed her.</p>

<p>We finished our conversation when Cookie quoted something I had said at the start of that brilliant performance in September. Graciously allowing me to talk about PennFuture&rsquo;s work before she sang, I ended my talk saying, &ldquo;What we are fighting for is what all of us need as human beings - clean air and clean water.&nbsp; These are a necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cookie said, &ldquo;That says it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thank you, Cookie, for supporting us with your incredible talent!&nbsp; Yours was a performance I won&rsquo;t soon forget!&nbsp;</p>

Our Clean Energy Future Requires Leadership from All,1/25/2018,"<div><strong>What will it take for Pennsylvania to break away from its dependence on dirty, unhealthy, old fuels like coal and gas, and move enthusiastically and proudly into a clean energy future?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s economic reliance on fossil fuel runs deeper than the veins of coal we insist on still extracting. In reality, our fossil fuel economy is as tenuous as the bedrock we frack and decimate to release natural gas into our lives. What will it take to leave it in the ground, and move boldly into a new energy, climate-friendly future driven by renewables and efficiency?&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>That &ldquo;future&rdquo; is taking place, right now, in other states that have embraced clean energy jobs.</strong>&nbsp;Neighboring states are making business development investments and creating incentives that attract wind, solar and related-manufacturing jobs, and create a new workforce to support clean energy industries. They are increasing public investment in research and development and innovation. This is happening in places like New Jersey, where new Governor Murphy <a href=""https://www.murphy4nj.com/issue/building-a-clean-energy-economy/"" target=""_blank"">prioritized clean energy during his campaign</a>,&nbsp;and in neighboring New York, where Governor Cuomo <a href=""https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-launches-5-billion-clean-energy-fund-grow-new-york-s-clean-energy-economy"" target=""_blank"">launched a $5 billion fund to grow New York&rsquo;s clean energy economy.</a></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Other states are reaping the economic benefits of clean energy now, at lower cost to public health, environment and climate than what Pennsylvanians must endure through the dominance of dirty energy.&nbsp;</strong>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s government is simply doing too much to facilitate the success of the fossil fuel industry, including sweetening fossil fuel development with exorbitant subsidies such as the nearly <a href=""http://www.toxicneighbor.org"" target=""_blank"">$1.6 billion that ex-Governor Tom Corbett provided Shell Chemical Appalachia</a> to build an ethane cracker plant in Beaver County so the world can have more plastic. Governor Wolf supports the plant.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>So, what needs to happen to wake Pennsylvania up to the future before the new energy economy passes us by and we&rsquo;re left unable to catch up with clean energy states?&nbsp;</strong></div>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Clean energy leadership and vision at the highest level of state government, namely through our next governor. </strong>Now that we are witnessing the success of the natural gas business, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s future governor must step up and help level the playing field between the fossil fuel industry and the clean energy industry. <a href=""https://www.e2.org/pennsylvania/"">Clean energy jobs are outpacing fossil fuel jobs in Pennsylvania</a> and deserve political support and public investment. The new governor must be prepared to present a package of incentives for clean energy, workforce development and greenhouse gas reduction.</li>
	<li><strong>Clean energy champions in our communities</strong> are needed to step up and run for elected office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Anti-environmental climate deniers in the state legislature must be held accountable</strong> for their unabashed embrace of natural gas and <a href=""http://marcellusmoney.org/"">their acceptance of gas lobby campaign support.</a>&nbsp;And if they will not be held to account, we need to turn them out of office. This will take time, but elections matter and can create long-lasting change.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Community activists must roll up the red carpet and pave over the yellow brick road being traveled by pipeline companies, the plastics industry and natural gas businesses and their lobbyists. </strong>Communities must begin to work in earnest on a viable clean energy economic development vision for their communities.</li>
	<li><strong>Statewide environmental advocacy organizations must do more to assist on-the-ground activists, through legal and policy assistance. </strong>Through our work in Harrisburg, organizations like PennFuture, PennEnvironment, Sierra Club and others must hold the line to defend existing laws and regulations in a hostile anti-regulatory state legislature. Here at PennFuture, we are planning projects with individual communities that are taking their clean energy and climate future into their own hands.&nbsp;Working in these communities, PennFuture will offer technical and planning assistance, and help with project development to local outcomes of reductions in the cost of energy and greenhouse gas reductions.</li>
	<li><strong>Policies must be adopted that continue to prioritize energy efficiency and clean renewable energy.</strong>&nbsp;This means defending our Act 129 energy efficiency program, strengthening our Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, and not wasting billions of dollars in tax breaks subsidizing dirty fossil fuels.</li>
	<li><strong>All of us need to play our part:</strong> change out your light bulbs, switch to energy star appliances, act on your ability to choose your electric supplier and choose clean energy by visiting <a href=""http://www.papowerswitch.com"" target=""_blank"">www.papowerswitch.com</a>, choose hybrid and electric vehicles, call an elected official and express your views, support your favorite environmental organization working hard for their missions.</li>
</ol>

<div>I believe clean energy and climate champions will carry the day.&nbsp;If there is any doubt, witness the moves by multinationals like BP, Shell, Ford.&nbsp;All are moving aggressively into the future, and the future is clean energy.&nbsp;</div>

2018 Work is Key to Reaching State's Clean Water Goals,1/25/2018,"<p>The Phase III Watershed Implementation Steering Committee meets this week in Harrisburg at a pivotal time for the Chesapeake Bay clean-up. In December, the steering committee met to discuss the mid-point assessment and to gather feedback from stakeholders to the PA Department of Environmental Protection and the Principals&rsquo; Staff Committee of the Chesapeake Bay Program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we turn to 2018, we are entering into the critical second half of the period for Pennsylvania to meets is pollution reduction goals by 2025, set by the Total Maximum Daily Load in 2010. For a number of reasons, progress made this year and the actions taken by the Phase III WIP Steering Committee and the state agencies will be crucial in setting the stage for how well Pennsylvania steps up to meet its obligations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In December, early information from the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program&rsquo;s model is showing that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 2025 targets for reducing nutrients may be 7 million pounds less for nitrogen and 270,000 pounds less for phosphorous than originally thought. While this is welcome news, PennFuture and clean water stakeholders plan to continue holding the state agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the WIP Steering Committee to strong commitments for our clean water. Pennsylvania needs a strong Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan in order to meet its goals and restore thousands of miles of streams and creeks.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Last week, DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell informed the Citizens Advisory Council on DEP&rsquo;s work with the Chesapeake Bay clean-up and shared that the Chesapeake Bay Program should be releasing its initial nutrient and sediment reduction targets in February, finalizing them in May.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secretary McDonnell rightly admits that Pennsylvania still faces uphill challenges in reaching the pollution reduction goals. While it remains a key concern for clean water stakeholders in Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Secretary McDonnell told the Citizens Advisory Council that the Conowingo Dam issue will be dealt on its own with its separate watershed implementation plan created by the owner of the dam &ndash; Exelon, EPA, Maryland, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2018 is shaping up to be a very important year for Chesapeake Bay and clean water policy in regard to the WIP and state agencies&rsquo; enforcement and work in water quality and restoration. On top of these challenges and movements in the right direction by our key policymakers in Pennsylvania, legislators in Harrisburg threaten the progress of the Chesapeake Bay clean-up and all of its stakeholders by continuing to challenge critical state funding for environmental projects, river basin commissions, and clean water programming at the Departments of Agriculture, Environmental Protection, and Conservation and Natural Resources. State elected officials are also actively seeking the roll-back of essential regulations to keep our water clean and are trying their best to implement a regime of supposed reform.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At the federal level, while the constant challenge to reach a deal on permanent appropriations from this Congress and presidential administration appear elusive, we have a few strong bills emerging from watershed legislators to help increase our buffers and funding to farmers as a part of the 2018 Farm Bill, including S.2139 from Senator Van Hollen (D-MD), and HR4420 from Congressman Bobby Scott (D-VA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this time, we need a strong state government commitment to restoring and protecting our drinking water in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture remains an integral part of the WIP development and discussions and state and federal levels of government for clean water.&nbsp;</p>

Replacing the Guardrails,1/24/2018,"<p><em><strong>By Larry J. Schweiger, President Emeritus, PennFuture</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Note: With so many unfathomable, discordant, and unsettling things emanating from the Trump administration, it is important that the numerous environmental threats and terrible actions summarized herein not get lost in the cacophony. We are losing much and we must work together as never before to find new ways to push back.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A number of years ago, my youngest daughter was driving back to college after her winter break and hit a patch of black ice and slid into the guardrails. I spent $500 replacing a single section of guardrail on I-79. I share this because I am watching the Trump administration ripping down critical environmental guardrails. Watching the loss of guardrail after guardrail, the questions I have been wrestling with include: Can the guardrails be repaired or replaced? If so, at what cost? Is there such a thing as being too late?</p>

<p>Until the recent tax bill was signed, many in the media had been suggesting that Trump isn&rsquo;t getting anything done. That was simply not true. While Trump was distracting us with his perverse tweets and endless lies, important regulations have been rolled back and in many cases, ended completely at an astounding rate. The Trump administration has been demonizing government, reminiscent of Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s rhetoric, but its actions go far beyond Reagan&rsquo;s. As Steve Bannon once boasted, the Trump appointees are &ldquo;deconstructing the administrative state&rdquo; at a pace that is hard to follow, and even harder to resist.</p>

<p>At the Environmental Protection Agency under Scott Pruitt, we are witnessing the abandonment of the Clean Water Rules, the retreat from the Paris Accord, moving to end the Clean Power Plan and the endangerment findings, gutting the highly successful auto rules, the national clean air guidelines and on and on I could go. Harvard University has created an environmental rollback tracker that has identified 40 environmental protections. <a href=""http://environment.law.harvard.edu/policy-initiative/regulatory-rollback-tracker/"" target=""_blank"">You can sign up for alerts here.</a></p>

<p>The failure to enforce existing law and the many inadequate settlements of prior enforcement actions, coupled with the stripping of publically funded climate science from their websites is and should be a continuing outrage. Despite the legacy of abandoned mines and polluted waterways in virtually every state where coal has been mined, the administration will not require the mining industry to provide financial assurances demonstrating that they have the capacity to clean up any and all pollution caused by mining. We are witnessing a race to the bottom with dark money and its appointed surrogates in charge of the very agencies that were created to protect our environment.</p>

<p>The tax bill got a lot of attention for the way it further advantaged the super wealthy and further concentrated wealth even more at a time when there is already grave inequities. What got very little if any coverage in the midst of this was the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge giveaway. To buy Senator Lisa Murkowski&rsquo;s vote for a bad tax bill, the Arctic Refuge was put up for oil development as an offset to some of the tax cuts for the wealthy. This is America&rsquo;s last remaining pristine Serengeti. Covering 29,800 square miles of untrammeled wilderness, it will now be exploited by the oil interests who will destroy the core calving area of the Porcupine Caribou herd that has been finding insect relief along the coastal plain for millennia. The coastal plain is a critical mosquito relief habitat considered by the Gwich&rsquo;in people to be sacred for 20,000 years.</p>

<p>Adding insult to this ecological injury, U. S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has put virtually all of the off-shore waters up for oil and gas leasing. While he was forced by their Republican lawmakers to retreat on the waters off the Florida coast for political reasons, the remaining waters are put at risk while Zinke abandoned all the important rules put in place after the disastrous BP oil spill, and he has scaled back the enforcement and monitoring procedures put in place to avoid another massive spill. Lessons learned from the BP spill are soon forgotten.</p>

<p>At the request of Utah&rsquo;s uranium industry and other special interests, Zinke cut the heart out of two important monuments (Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante) so they can be leased for mineral development. He diminished the size of a total of six monuments including the lifting of fishing restrictions in a critical ocean sanctuary established by George W. Bush.</p>

<p>In another disgusting action, Zinke doubled the cost of entering a National Park to seventy dollars and in seventeen parks the fee will be seventy-five dollars. These fees will be prohibitive for many young families, for minorities and especially for the poor struggling to just make ends meet. Even before the doubling of the fees, only seven percent of the visitors to the parks were black according to a survey commissioned by the National Park Service. Do we really want our National Parks to be restricted to a privileged few?</p>

<p>Nine of 12 members of the Congressionally sanctioned National Park System Advisory Board resigned because Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke ignored the board for a year. The committee established in 1935 has been vital to the Park Service. In recent years the committee has advised the Interior Department on how to deal with global warming, emphasized the need to protect American historical sites and advised the service on how to encourage more young people to the parks.</p>

<p>If that was not enough, Zinke announced on Dec.&nbsp;22 that he had come up with a new legal interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act that strictly prohibits the unregulated killing of birds. Migratory birds landing on toxic waste impoundments often associated with fracking are often killed and have been treated as a violation of the law. The Zinke memorandum reinterprets the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to allow corporations to kill migratory birds outside of carefully established seasons and bag limits contrary to the long-standing interpretation by every administration since 1970.</p>

<p>Trump just put a 30 percent&nbsp;tariff on solar panels imported from China. This pushes the cost of solar higher. He is just one year in and we must expect more damaging environmental policies. Those of us deeply concerned with the environment must come to the realization that we must become much more active politically and begin to work with those seeking fundamental reforms to restore our democracy.</p>

<p>The environment will not be protected until we address the broken democracy. Environmentalists like so many Americans are shell-shocked. It&rsquo;s a much more complicated situation and we are forced to dig deeper into our plight and find pathways to recover our floundering democracy. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court took an important first step this week overthrowing one of the most egregious gerrymandered Congressional districts in the country. Much more must be done.</p>

Supreme Court Decision May Impact Trump Administration’s Attempt to Repeal the Clean Water Rule,1/23/2018,"<p>The Supreme Court issued a <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-299_8nk0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">unanimous decision</a> yesterday that challenges to EPA&rsquo;s Clean Water Rule (CWR) were properly brought before federal District Courts, and not federal appellate courts. The decision is not about the validity of EPA&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;waters of the United State,&rdquo; but instead involves the procedural issue as to where challenges to EPA&rsquo;s rule must be filed.&nbsp; The decision is important, nonetheless, because it invalidates an appellate court decision that had prevented the CWR from taking affect across the Nation.</p>

<p>The issue before the court was which federal courts could review challenges to the 2015 CWR, which defined &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; under the Clean Water Act.&nbsp; After EPA promulgated the rule, numerous lawsuits were filed challenging the CWR in both federal district courts and federal courts of appeal or so-called circuit courts. In one of those cases, the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a nationwide stay that prevented the CWR from taking effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The government argued that the 6th Circuit had jurisdiction to issue its decision.&nbsp; Typically, challenges to EPA rules must be filed with a district court and not an appellate court like the 6th Circuit.&nbsp; However, the Clean Water Act provides seven categories of EPA actions that can be challenged in circuit courts.&nbsp; The government argued that this was one of those types of actions that could, and should, be challenged in circuit courts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court rejected all of the government&rsquo;s legal and policy arguments.&nbsp; The Court held that the CWR is &ldquo;a definitional rule that clarifies the scope of the statutory term&rdquo; and while litigating before the district courts may be less efficient and may result in a less uniform regulatory landscape, the plain language of the Clean Water Act shows that Congress made clear that rules like the CWR must be reviewed first by the federal district courts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision will impact the nationwide stay of the CWR imposed by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Once the 6th Circuit dismisses the case, as directed by the Supreme Court, the CWR will be reinstated in all states &ndash; including Pennsylvania &ndash; except in those 13 western states for which the District Court of North Dakota issued a stay on the CWR in 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the CWR, EPA defined &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; in a manner that clarified that protections under Clean Water Act covered small intermittent and ephemeral streams and wetlands.&nbsp;These waters are critical not only in their own right, but also for the water quality of the larger bodies of water of which these smaller streams are a part.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This decision will also impact the Trump Administration&rsquo;s 2017 attempts to repeal the CWR.&nbsp; The government sought to preserve the circuit court&rsquo;s jurisdiction over the CWR because they are generally viewed as being less inclined to overturn federal agency rules, which might have made it harder for environmental groups to challenge Trump&rsquo;s effort to repeal and replace the existing CWR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Using PennFuture’s New Click-To-Call Advocacy Tool,1/16/2018,"<p><strong>What is Click-To-Call?</strong></p>

<p>PennFuture is providing a new advocacy tool for supporters, allowing you to call your representatives directly with the help of easily accessible talking points and a phone connection made with the simple click of a button.</p>

<p>In December, we launched our first ever campaign using a Click-To-Call action to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and we look forward to using it even more in the future during times in which your rapid response to elected officials is needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The process involves three simple steps and only takes about 3 minutes to complete. In that short time, you will have made a major impact in our work to protect the environment!</strong></p>

<p>While sending emails and letters to representatives is always an effective way to share your opinions on issues that matter to you, click-to-call actions allow citizens to create a larger sense of urgency for elected officials when the window for change is smaller than usual. This tool will be crucial in our fight in 2018 for clean air, water, and a healthier future for Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how it works:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>After you receive a PennFuture e-mail requesting you to take action through click-to-call, you&nbsp; will fill out a form with your contact information. After that, you will see the name and phone number for your representatives. Please note that you should not call the number during this step.&nbsp; Our technology takes care of that for you later.</li>
	<li>During the next step, you will be able to see and review the provided talking points for the phone call with your representative.</li>
	<li>At the very bottom of this page, you will find a space to add your phone number. After submitted, you will receive a phone call detailing the issue and preparing you for the conversation. Then, using the talking points, you complete the call!</li>
</ol>

<p>After the call is complete and the staff-person or representative has hung up, you will then receive a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; call to let you know that your action is done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you to all of our supporters, and please email me at <a href=""mailto:cupo@pennfuture.org"">cupo@pennfuture.org</a>, if you have any questions about this new and exciting tool.</p>

How to Effectively Comment on the DRBC’s Draft Fracking Regulations,1/8/2018,"<div>On Nov.&nbsp;30, 2017, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) <a href=""http://www.state.nj.us/drbc/meetings/proposed/notice_hydraulic-fracturing.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>issued draft regulations</strong></a> regarding fracking within the Delaware River Basin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>In short, the draft regulations do the following:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Prohibits high-volume hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in shale and other rock formations within the Basin;</li>
	<li>Regulates Delaware River water use for fracking outside of the Basin (inter-basin water transfer); and</li>
	<li>Regulates the treatment and disposal of produced water/wastewater from fracking from outside of the Basin.</li>
</ul>

<div>As with any proposed regulations, DRBC is accepting public comment on its draft fracking regulations.&nbsp;Submitting written comments on proposed environmental actions is a way to make your voice heard and to influence decisions on the issues you care about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Public participation is an essential part of the rulemaking process.&nbsp;In particular, public comments can do the following:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Strengthen a regulation;</li>
	<li>Create a comprehensive and accurate record; and</li>
	<li>Support an appropriate and informed decisionmaking process.</li>
</ul>

<div>While PennFuture continues to review and develop its own comments, we strongly encourage each and every one of you to write to DRBC to express your gratitude (banning fracking in the Basin!) and your concerns (allowing other dangerous activities).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Written public comments can be as short or as detailed as you want them to be, but there are a few tips and techniques that can help make your comments persuasive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>And so, PennFuture developed a short video on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQbNpEmkTQ&amp;feature=youtu.be"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;How to Effectively Engage in the Public Commenting Process.</a>&rdquo; These tips include:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Use specific examples and highlight how the regulations could impact you, your family, your community, and the natural resources you love.</li>
	<li>Use persuasive language throughout.</li>
	<li>Present your comments in a clear, concise, and respectful manner.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>DRBC is accepting public comment on these draft regulations until 5 p.m. on March 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Unfortunately, the only way to submit written comments on these draft regulations is through DRBC&rsquo;s online comments webpage at <a href=""http://dockets.drbc.commentinput.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://dockets.drbc.commentinput.com/</a>.&nbsp; DRBC is not accepting emailed, faxed, or hand- or postal-delivered comments. (PennFuture submitted this letter&nbsp; regarding DRBC&rsquo;s flawed public participation process.)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Public Hearings</strong></div>

<div>The DRBC is also holding public hearings during which it will accept oral comments on its draft fracking regulations. It&rsquo;s not too late to register to attend these hearings and hear others&rsquo; concerns. Although the deadline to register to speak has passed, DRBC has indicated that you may still be able to register to speak if time is available.</div>

"How You Can Get Involved: ""Our Water Campaign""",1/2/2018,"<p>Although very much underplayed by the general public and the media, <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2016/2/3/10904120/lead-exposure-flint-pennsylvania"" target=""_blank"">Pittsburgh is facing a drinking water crisis</a>, with lead levels still high in many homes and water rates increasing by 28 percent in 2018. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/OurH2o/about/?ref=page_internal"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;Our Water Campaign&rdquo;</a></strong><br />
Comprised of Pittsburgh United, Clean Water Action, Pennsylvania Interfaith Impact Network, Sierra Club, Nine Mile Run Watershed, Hill District Consensus Group, Thomas Merton Center, One Pennsylvania, and PennFuture, the campaign is a coalition that believes safe, clean water is a vital resource for the Pittsburgh region and that the lack of investment and repair of our public water system threatens our economy and public health.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The need for safe and healthy drinking water is too important to be left in the hands of corporations. The profit motive will always come before the needs of residents. We need solutions that treat our public water as a common good and human right for all, where residents&rsquo; health isn&rsquo;t put at risk so corporations can turn a profit. Residents have made it clear that they want more control and accountability over the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, not less.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, when Washington, D.C.-based Infrastructure Management Group (IMG), hired by the city to explore options to rebuild PWSA, suggested a public trust to govern the authority, we have to ask if this is the best decision for the residents of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>If IMG&rsquo;s recommendation was implemented, the public trust would be placed under the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Public Utility Commission, and would then lease its infrastructure to a private entity and dissolve PWSA&rsquo;s current board.</p>

<p>However, a functional PWSA that keeps the authority completely public is achievable!&nbsp;</p>

<p>PWSA has listened to public input and has passed a plan to replace lead service lines, invest in green infrastructure, and protect low-income residents with a Customer Assistance Program. <a href=""http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/932_PWSA_Report.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>You can read the full plan here.</strong></a></p>

<p>In addition, thanks to the recent passage of a new state law, PWSA may finally have the funding and the authority to replace private lead lines, with permission from homeowners.</p>

From the CEO: PennFuture Priorities in 2018,12/19/2017,"<p>The PennFuture staff has been reflecting on 2017 as the year comes to an end. Many of us and our supporters tend to view the year as one marked by profound threats &ndash; to our climate system and our children&rsquo;s&nbsp;futures, to our democracy, and to the institutions and laws that give us some measure of protection from pollution. Indeed, the year was marked by all of that, but also by counterbalances that can end up being similarly profound.</p>

<p>With the president&rsquo;s <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Statement-on-Paris-Climate-Agreement-Withdrawal"">withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Climate Accord</a>, we&rsquo;ve seen the Paris to Pittsburgh movement take shape, culminating in former Vice President Al Gore and the Heinz Endowments&rsquo; hosting of the largest ever Climate Reality Project training in Pittsburgh this past October. As a result, we have hundreds of new climate communicators in our state, ready to deploy and bring solid information about the climate crisis and its solutions to the public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have seen the PA State Supreme Court issue a second important opinion in <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-State-Supreme-Court-Rules-Leasing-Public-Land-for-Fracking-Betrayed-Governments-Constitutional-Duties""><em>PEDF v. Tom Wolf, Governor and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</em></a>, building favorable case law around the Environmental Rights Amendment to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Constitution. And the gerrymandering movement has tremendous momentum.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen environmental issues influence elections in places like Delaware County and Jessup, where voters turned pro-pipeline and pro-gas elected officials out of office and replaced them with clean energy visionaries.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We are entering 2018 with a wind at our backs. Here is a look at PennFuture&rsquo;s priorities for the coming year:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Clean Energy Cities Initiative</strong><br />
In the wake of the Paris withdrawal, we&rsquo;ve witnessed Pennsylvania communities and elected officials step up by taking pledges and other actions that indicate their seriousness in taking their climate future into their own hands. What comes next for these communities, especially smaller ones that are willing but perhaps lacking the expertise and resources to take the next big step into renewables and energy efficiency? <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/careers-and-internships"">PennFuture is piloting a program in Pittsburgh</a> that we hope to expand to three new communities as support grows. PennFuture will be on the ground&nbsp; in communities, ready to offer technical and planning assistance, help design projects and find resources to move communities aggressively in the new energy space, bypassing the anti-environmental forces and climate deniers trying to hold this unstoppable movement down.</p>

<p><strong>Green in &rsquo;18 Campaign</strong><br />
As part of our new civic engagement program, formed as a result of our January 2017 strategic alliance with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/careers-and-internships"">PennFuture will launch its Green in &rsquo;18 campaign.</a> The campaign will elevate the public discussion around environmental issues in the upcoming elections. PennFuture and Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania are working with more than 30 environmental, land, water and recreation groups to design a common agenda of priority issues for our organizations. The Green in &rsquo;18 campaign will focus its attention on these issue priorities and find opportunities for all candidates in key elections to react to and discuss key issues in the water, air, and energy arenas.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Using the Courts</strong><br />
PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team plans to explore ideas to be more creative and aggressive with our litigation activity. We will continue our good work in the enforcement and regulatory arenas, but can we push harder on litigation around the Environmental Rights Amendment and climate issues?&nbsp; PennFuture&rsquo;s legacy of impact around our legal work has been defined by selecting smart cases that have broad implications. We want our work defined by that criteria, but we want to use the courts fully, especially in times like these when the legislature is actively stymying our ability to advance a clean water, clean air, and clean energy agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Restoring the Ohio River Basin</strong><br />
The Ohio River is at a critical juncture, again named America&rsquo;s most polluted river according to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Toxics Release Inventory. But in comparison to our other great river systems, the Ohio Basin is underserved, especially when considering the threat of a multi-state petrochemical complex that will further degrade the basin&rsquo;s air, water and public health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture currently is part of two large, multi-state coalitions working to protect local waters of the Delaware River, and the Susquehanna River, respectively. As part of these coalitions, PennFuture is coordinating a large number of state, regional and local groups active in Pennsylvania and in these two major watersheds. PennFuture and National Wildlife Federation seek to begin a closer examination of threats to the Ohio, and working with other organizations, academics and resource managers, begin to craft pathways to environmental health and economic prosperity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Your Support Makes it Possible</strong><br />
We hope you find these upcoming undertakings of PennFuture worthwhile and exciting, and worthy of your advocacy support and <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/donate"">financial investment in 2018</a>. This list only reflects a small portion of the excellent and impactful work and campaigns that will continue in 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will continue to build our presence in mid-size towns and communities throughout our state. We will put forth solutions and alternatives to economic development defined by dirty energy.&nbsp; Thank you for supporting our Toxic Neighbor campaign to protect Pittsburgh&rsquo;s air from polluters like U.S. Steel and Royal Dutch Shell. Thank you for supporting our newest office and staff in Mount Pocono, where we are working to protect the headwater streams of the Delaware River Basin. Thank you for making our ability to represent clients through our legal services a reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have a big year planned, and I hope to see you along the way, perhaps at our Women In Conservation event in the Philadelphia area in April, or at our Fall 2018 Solar Tour in Pittsburgh. Together, we will continue to make a difference.</p>

Chesapeake Bay Efforts Headed in Right Direction for 2018,12/18/2017,"<p>As we approach the end of this crucial year for the Chesapeake Bay clean-up and efforts to meet its pollution reduction goals, Pennsylvania has taken a number of actions over the last month to capture the status of the state and provide input to the Environmental Protection Agency for the Total Maximum Daily Load&rsquo;s mid-point assessment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Halfway to 2025, the decisions and efforts Bay watershed states make in 2018 will ensure that they remain (or get on track) to meeting those pollution reduction goals.</p>

<p>In November, the Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) Steering Committee for Pennsylvania recommended to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) that local goals for the WIP should be developed at the county scale and the level of effort for the Bay planning targets should be equal for all jurisdictions in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These decisions should be applauded, because they are strong, but feasible and realistic policy decisions for implementing changes and best management practices for Pennsylvania. Rich Batiuk at the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) office shared that he believes this was the right way for the Commonwealth, but recent discussions with EPA CBP Director Nicholas DiPasquale remind stakeholders that Pennsylvania should not lose sight of keeping a strong focus on York and Lancaster Counties specifically. Intentional and intensive focus must remain on the South Central Pennsylvania counties, which contribute the most load (nutrient pollutants and sediment) to the Susquehanna and Potomac River basins.</p>

<p>Over the last several months, DEP and EPA have collected &ndash; and continue to collect -&nbsp; a significant amount of data and continuously monitor and analyze information to better perform and make public policy decisions. But, it is important to effectively target and prioritize available funding, technical, and human resources. It is becoming more evident that Pennsylvania should leverage relationships with public-private partnerships, involve the private sector to meet goals, and include innovative technology in its path forward, but these strategies and tactics must be proven to work and be equitable.</p>

<p>At last week&rsquo;s December WIP Steering Committee meeting, stakeholders discussed other essential issues that need to be resolved for the Mid-Point Assessment of the Bay Program. Among these are Pennsylvania&rsquo;s take on the effects of climate change on the Bay watershed, sector growth, and the issue of the Conowingo Dam on the Susquehanna River.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While these are large topics that encompass a great deal of uncertainty, changing landscapes and input needs, Pennsylvania must step up and be a strong leader on climate change in the next WIP and its actions moving forward in the Chesapeake Bay clean-up. Though it should be a team effort with New York and Maryland, addressing the overflowing of sedimentation and pollutants at the Conowingo Dam must include Pennsylvania as an equal party to provide support in finding a solution.</p>

<p>In terms of sector growth, it is imperative that the Commonwealth be thoughtful and include its ramifications in all planning processes. Tomorrow, the Principals&rsquo; Staff Committee of the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program meets to take action on the TMDL mid-point assessment, and we urge strong policies be enacted on climate change, the Conowingo Dam, and growth in the Bay watershed.</p>

<p>It is long past time for Pennsylvania to step up and be a leader in the Chesapeake Bay clean-up, but recent actions provide some hope for next steps. As stakeholders and citizen advocates, we must continue to remind our legislators and executive officials that clean water matters in Pennsylvania. To restore and steward our beloved watersheds in the Commonwealth, we must hold fast our engagement and commitment to rigorous planning goals and targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beside all requirements and goals, I long for the day I can share a few hours of crayfishing with my nephews in the currently impaired Conococheague and paddling in the impaired Susquehanna without fear of dirty water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My New Year&rsquo;s resolution is to continue pushing hard for clean water in Pennsylvania and share my favorite waterways with friends and family more often. What&rsquo;s yours?</p>

"Proxy Battles, Bad Omens, and Small Victories: A 2017 Policy Retrospective",12/18/2017,"<div>A war against environmental protection is being waged in Pennsylvania and 2017 was about positioning for the next round of legislative attacks.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Proxy battles were waged through negotiations on the state budget and a proposed severance tax on natural gas, signaling larger efforts to come in 2018. And the legislature continued its dismantling of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The callous legislative attacks on foundational clean air, water, and public lands policies continue and are unrelenting.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s important to not lose sight of the victories in 2017 that are having tangible impacts and will improve local air quality and boost renewable energy and energy efficiency in the Commonwealth.</strong> Certainly, defending our communities and ecologies from bad legislation is a top priority, but advancing good legislation has been critical to re-engaging the public and policy community to show what good environmental laws can do for people&rsquo;s health, jobs, and living space.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>In retrospect, the headlines below best summarize the state of environmental policy in 2017:</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gutting basic protections against oil and gas industry pollution.</strong> A major proxy battle over oil and gas regulations was (and is still being) fought through the severance tax debate. The Senate and Governor agreed to a deal in the summer that would have levied a small severance tax in exchange for weakening the DEP&rsquo;s ability to enact strong permits for industrial activity. In particular, it would have shifted some of DEP&rsquo;s permitting authority to industry-chosen third-party reviewers, as well as forced DEP to approve all permits within a certain period of time, no matter if they&rsquo;re deficient. This bill died in the House, but momentum for gutting DEP permits still remains.</li>
	<li><strong>Allowing unlimited methane pollution.</strong> The Governor has made it a priority to implement the Commonwealth&rsquo;s first ever limits on methane pollution and the legislature is doing its best to stop that from happening. A provision to give the legislature the ability to veto any methane regulations was passed by the Senate and proposed in the House. DEP is advancing new methane limits on new oil and gas infrastructure as I write this blog, setting up a significant battle in 2018 over its success, as well as efforts to implement methane limits on existing oil and gas operations.</li>
	<li><strong>The continued dismantling of DEP. </strong>The FY2017-18 state budget was similar to the last decade in that DEP&rsquo;s budget was cut another 6 to 7 percent, depending on the line item. This adds to the 40 percent already cut in DEP&rsquo;s budget over the last ten years. This hollowing out is having tangible impact, as we see fewer inspectors who can ensure water supplies are safe, fewer inspections of oil and gas activity, fewer permit reviewers, and a smaller number of scientists studying new sources of pollution. For a state with a long history of environmental degradation, it&rsquo;s a stunning and underreported story with long-term consequences, and these shortages leave everyone at risk.</li>
	<li><strong>New subsidies for nuclear plants put on hold. </strong>Nuclear industry efforts for new subsidies benefitting its five Pennsylvania plants didn&rsquo;t gain traction with the legislature in 2017. Instead, the industry pushed the legislature to provide its toothless support for the Department of Energy&rsquo;s (DOE) request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to immediately provide support for aging coal and nuclear plants. Depending on what FERC ultimately does with DOE&rsquo;s request dictates whether the nuclear industry will apply significant pressure to get state subsidies in 2018.</li>
	<li><strong>Solar receives a legislative boost. </strong>Solar energy finally received support from Harrisburg. A provision in the state budget (Administrative Code, House Bill 118) includes language to &ldquo;close Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar borders.&rdquo; What this means is that utilities must source solar energy projects housed in Pennsylvania to meet the Commonwealth&rsquo;s solar target (0.5 percent by 2020), rather than being able to source outside of the state. Under previous law, utilities were sourcing more than 70 percent of its projects from outside the state, stealing jobs and projects from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar industry.</li>
	<li><strong>Commercial PACE builds momentum.</strong> Commercial PACE (C-PACE), which provides new financing mechanisms for municipalities wanting to support commercial buildings becoming more energy efficient, took steps forward in 2017. The bill is cosponsored by nearly 2/3 of the state Senate and is poised for passage in 2018.</li>
	<li><strong>Protecting the Delaware River Basin from fracking. </strong>The Delaware River Basin Commission took its next steps toward officially banning oil and gas drilling in the Delaware River basin. While much of this process will play out through 2018, it was an important step toward protecting the important headwaters of the Delaware and the ecology it supports. As it currently stands, the proposed regulations aren&rsquo;t perfect and would still allow fracking fluid to travel from and through the basin. As such, more work needs to be done on the regulations, but the ban on fracking is a major step toward protecting this important water resource for the state.</li>
</ul>

<div>Many of these issues and battles will continue well into 2018, leaving no rest for the weary. There are bad omens signaling further attacks in the near future, but public engagement, perseverance, good science, and strong advocacy are helping turn the tide and beat back, at least some, bad legislation.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I personally started 2017 much more cynically toward what was to come. It had been a bruising 2016 and environmental protection was poised for more rollbacks. But I end 2017 on a positive note. <strong>I see a re-energized environmental community and a general public catching on to the bad deals they&rsquo;re being dealt. </strong>Furthermore, I see pathways to advancing new protections and stopping the agents of greed and environmental destruction from succeeding in making Pennsylvania a wild west for industry and pollution.</div>

The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is Not for Sale,12/14/2017,"<p>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge spans over 19 million acres, a third of which is designated as pristine Alaskan wilderness and is a habitat for polar bears and dozens of other species. Hundreds of thousands of porcupine caribou, native to Alaska, migrate each year through the Coastal Plain. (1) The Arctic Refuge is an incredible example of America&rsquo;s natural legacy and is a symbol to the world that the United States has historically been one of the great stewards of the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>However, that legacy may soon be tarnished by greed and profit.</strong> On Nov. 16, the House of Representatives passed the first version of the tax bill, which did not include anything regarding the Arctic Refuge. A week later, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) added a provision to the Senate version of the Tax Bill that essentially opens the Arctic Refuge&rsquo;s Coastal Plain to oil and gas drilling through an auction of lease sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The resulting profit would cover only a fraction of the deficit that will result from the deep tax cuts that congressional leaders are proposing. </strong>The Coastal Plain is an ecological center for the wildlife that lives in the Arctic Refuge. Selling off these lands to oil and gas corporations to support tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans makes little economic sense and endangers a national treasure, which will never be able to be replaced once it is gone.</p>

<p>On Dec. 2, the Senate passed its version of the tax bill, which included Senator Murkowski&rsquo;s Arctic Refuge provision. In a process called &ldquo;Reconciliation,&rdquo; representatives from each congressional chamber have been tasked with reconciling differences between the House and Senate versions. Once complete, this compromise bill will return to the House of Representatives for a vote. Unfortunately, reports say that the Arctic Refuge provision will be included in the &ldquo;reconciled&rdquo; bill.</p>

<p>The Arctic Refuge has been imperiled before, but the decision to open the Coastal Plain is a deeply unpopular one. Environmental groups and conservationists across the country are critical of the tax bill, in part because of this provision.</p>

<p>Collin O&rsquo;Mara, President and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, of which PennFuture is a state affiliate, is one of those leaders who has worked to mobilize action on behalf of preserving this habitat for so many species of animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drilling in the arctic will forever scar one of the remaining truly wild places on earth with a maze of well pads, roads, and pipelines. Destroying critical habitat for imperiled polar bears, porcupine caribou, and musk oxen, not for national security reasons, but for short-term tax breaks that benefit the few, is simply wrong. Some places are too special to drill. We urge members of Congress to defend the Arctic,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Mara said.</p>

<p>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a wildlife refuge first and foremost. It should remain fully protected for the many generations to come.</p>

Pittsburgh's Dirty Open Secret: Air Pollution,12/12/2017,"<p><em>Pictured: Greg Cooper and Colleen Sohn outside of their former home in Bellevue.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>By Colleen Sohn, Guest Blogger and Former Pittsburgh Resident</strong></em></p>

<p>Shortly after ringing in 2015, in the wee hours of the morning, I awoke to an acrid burning. In the moment of dread and terror before shaking my husband and hopping from bed, I thought: We&#39;ve only lived here a month and haven&#39;t even unpacked all the boxes.</p>

<p>Lightning quick, we dashed around the house, upstairs and downstairs, finding no flame. My husband unearthed a flashlight, and champion that he is, ran outside, clad only in underpants. There, he realized it was neither the house, nor the garage, but the sky, our neighborhood cloaked in a cloud of toxic air.</p>

<p>We were born and raised in Colorado, and had spent the previous 16 years living in Portland, Oregon. It was not as though pollution was entirely foreign to us. Denver&#39;s brown cloud of our youth was an ugly brute that often kept kids inside and friends and relations from burning fires in winter. We&#39;d caught dreadful whiffs of air from the paper plant located upriver from our home in Portland. Sadly, these were mere kittens to the beast we would experience in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>My husband and I consider ourselves to be adventurous and easy going. We love to travel, to experience new places. After spending the first half of our lives in the West, we decided it was time to better know the East. From all we read online, it seemed Pittsburgh was the place to do it. Like Portland, it is a river city, fancies itself &quot;green,&quot; and has a burgeoning restaurant scene. There&#39;s great architecture, a gorgeous skyline, and world renowned institutions of learning. It&#39;s also a mere day-long (or less) drive from practically every city and town we hadn&#39;t yet had the opportunity to explore. Perfect on paper.</p>

<p>I arrived in October to buy a house. The skies were clear and bright and the winds were favorable. I never caught so much as a whiff of the air that would come to be my tormentor. I looked at houses in practically every neighborhood, too distracted by the task at hand to notice the chemical plants and factories along the rivers. I settled on a 1908 brick beauty in the borough of Bellevue. We could walk to the library, shops and restaurants, and zoot easily downtown. Again, perfect on paper.</p>

<p>Then, that fateful night, everything changed. At first, we thought it was a fluke. Then, we were taken aback, again and again, out to get groceries, visiting friends, a myriad of awful scents on the breeze. We asked around. &quot;I don&#39;t smell anything,&quot; they said. &quot;It&#39;s pollution from Ohio,&quot; they said. &quot;It&#39;s trains passing,&quot; they said. And then we saw it, Neville Island, and knew.</p>

<p>We learned about black carbon, part and parcel of PM2.5 - known to increase risks of lung cancer, asthma, and heart attacks, Pittsburgh&#39;s dirty open secret. We also came to know what we called the Pittsburgh mantra: &quot;You should have seen it before. It&#39;s better than it was!&quot; We heard the &quot;hell with the lid off&quot; stories, the businessmen who changed their soot stained shirts at lunchtime stories. And so it was better, and yet so awful.</p>

<p>As our interests and circle of friends widened, we further explored the city, secretly hoping we would find that magic spot where the pollution would not find us and perhaps move there. We had fun evenings in Mount Lebanon, saw movies in Regent Square and Lawrenceville, ate burgers on the South Side Flats, perused the murals of dahn-tahn, walked in Frick and Schenley Parks, and were assaulted. We met friends at an outdoor classical music concert on the most gorgeous of summer days in Highland Park, spreading our blankets in the warmth of the sun, only to be assaulted, yet again. We complained amongst ourselves and were on the receiving end of the evil eye from surrounding concert-goers. How dare we speak the truth out loud.</p>

<p>We kept a calendar, rating the air from zero to four. Zero was a lucky day, one where we could walk the neighborhood, dash off to the Phipps or the cookie shop and not feel our nostrils burning. A four had our HEPA filter on full blast. Our calendar showed more one to four days than zeroes, a whole lot more.</p>

<p>And so it went, any time we questioned or saw anyone else question the polluted air, we heard the Pittsburgh mantra, it was blamed on Ohio, or were told, &quot;Hope the door kicks you on the way out.&quot; And so we left, just over a year after moving into our lovely home. We&#39;re back in the West, Colorado Springs. The air is some of the cleanest in the country, and each day we breathe a literal sigh of relief that we were among the lucky ones. We could leave.</p>

<p><em><strong>Colleen Sohn is a bit of a renaissance woman. A former teacher, she is a photographer, writer, gardener, and ace cook. Born and raised in the West, she&#39;s happy to be back in her home state of Colorado. She and her husband lived in Pittsburgh for one year, between 2014 and 2015.</strong></em></p>

Your Donation Keeps Eagles Safe in Their Nests,12/12/2017,"<p>PennFuture&#39;s work to protect and sustain the natural habitats of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s wildlife is effective - and sometimes that hard work leads to other environmental benefits &ndash; like a new park!&nbsp;</p>

<p>A 600-acre woodland set high on a hilltop overlooking the Monongahela River in Pittsburgh, known as Hays Woods, has long had an amazing diversity of wildlife that called it home. So, when Hays Woods became a high-profile, proposed location for a strip mine intended to level its hills and fill its stream valleys to pave the way for a race track and casino, PennFuture&rsquo;s Vice President of Legal Affairs, George Jugovic, Jr., led the way to protect it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture partnered with neighbors, grassroots organizations, activists, university students, and concerned decision makers to fight to protect the woodlands and streams for local wildlife. The work that began in 2003 culminated in a 2009 major legal victory for Hays Woods and Pittsburgh&rsquo;s environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then in 2013, eagles began nesting in the forested hillsides of the property. Thirty years ago, there were only three nesting pairs of bald eagles in all of Pennsylvania. Today, more than 270 pairs nest in our state. Their recovery in Pennsylvania, and throughout the nation, is one of our great wildlife conservation stories. Habitats like that of Hays Woods are critical for their continued recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And today, Hays Woods takes another step to being the newest park in Pittsburgh, something that would not be possible if not for the good work of PennFuture&#39;s lawyers, which prevented mountain top mining on the Hays Woods site more than 14 years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our legal work is more critical than ever and <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2017dec/index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=fba1a123-4ab3-4243-b044-d50e8ac2c2ab&amp;eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=4173f0bf-87f6-4917-bf94-cd69ec19f3de""><strong>your tax-deductible gift to PennFuture </strong></a>is a powerful investment as we fight on your behalf to protect our parks, wildlife and special habitats for generations to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

How Pending Federal Appropriations Might Affect Chesapeake Bay Watershed,12/7/2017,"<p>As our federal government approaches Friday&rsquo;s deadline to avoid a government shutdown, we wanted to check-in on how pending federal appropriations proposals will affect the Susquehanna River Basin and larger Chesapeake Bay watershed in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The health of the Susquehanna River basin and the Chesapeake Bay watershed in Pennsylvania is something that PennFuture works hard to protect and fight for every day through policy, litigation, communications, and outreach. For the past several years, PennFuture has led the fight for listing the lower Susquehanna River as impaired after the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission found signs of sick aquatic life, advocating for increased conservation dollars for farmers, and cutting back on the overuse of fertilizer. Not only does PennFuture lead the Commonwealth&rsquo;s clean water advocacy efforts at the state level, but our constant presence and relationships forged with our federal legislative offices have forced the slow-down of regulatory roll-backs and the draconian gutting of critical funding for the Susquehanna River basin.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the White House released its 2018 federal budget proposal, which included massive cuts to investment in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Alarmingly, President Trump&rsquo;s proposal slashed the EPA&rsquo;s annual Chesapeake Bay Program budget from $73 million to $0. If the proposed budget had been enacted, it would have been impossible for Pennsylvania to meet its pollution reduction obligations required by the U.S. Clean Water Act to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and restore local streams in the Susquehanna River basin.</p>

<p>Chesapeake Bay Program funding for restoration comprises nearly 55 percent&nbsp;of its total budget. Under President Trump&rsquo;s proposal, Pennsylvania would have lost nearly $12 million in aid through Chesapeake Bay Implementation grants and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Stewardship grants. If the Bay Program&rsquo;s almost $41 million of on-the-ground grant funding disappeared, the state of Pennsylvania would be left without the resources necessary to guarantee clean water to local communities and businesses. At a time when there is broad-based support to work on pollution reduction compliance goals, this funding is crucial to support a wide range of watershed efforts, including agricultural best management practices for farmers, green infrastructure and stormwater management for municipalities, and protecting riparian buffers along streams.</p>

<p>Despite 63 percent of Americans having a favorable view of the EPA, under President Trump&rsquo;s proposal, the EPA&rsquo;s budget would take the hardest hit of any agency. Its 31 percent budget cut would eliminate more than 3,000 staff and discontinue a number of programs critical to the survival of America&rsquo;s wildlife.</p>

<p>Without full funding, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waters are put in jeopardy by nutrient pollution, erosion, sediment, and run-off. A healthy and robust Chesapeake Bay Program budget is an integral part of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s effort to ensure clean water for its citizens and the Susquehanna River basin.</p>

<p><u><strong>Fortunately, we can tell a different story.&nbsp;</strong></u></p>

<p>Through the spring, summer, and fall, PennFuture has been actively working with congressional offices across the state and in Washington to reinstall the EPA funding for the Chesapeake and Susquehanna. We learned in October that the House Interior Appropriations bill has approved returning $60 million to EPA&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Program, and just before Thanksgiving, we heard that the newly passed Senate Interior Appropriations bill has included $73 million for the Chesapeake Bay Program, with $6 million for each grant program ($12 million in total).</p>

<p>PennFuture extends deep thanks to our champions for Chesapeake funding in the House of Representatives for their work in seeing the Bay Program&rsquo;s budget secured and renewed &ndash; namely, Congressman Glenn Thompson, Congressman Charlie Dent, Congressman Lloyd Smucker, and Congressman Matt Cartwright. PennFuture thanks Senator Bob Casey, as well, for his continued support for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Chesapeake and Susquehanna funding.</p>

<p>Our pollution reduction goals for the Chesapeake Bay watershed cannot be realized without continuing to make these clean water investments in our communities. We are asking our federal legislators and President Trump to support funding for programs that provide aid to Pennsylvania, local governments and communities, and farmers throughout our region. A strong EPA is essential for the restoration and stewardship of the Susquehanna River basin. We ask our members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation to bring back full, dedicated funding for our clean water in upcoming appropriations legislation.</p>

<p>Anyone who spends time in the outdoors knows that Pennsylvania has abundant water resources. With more than 86,000 miles of streams, we&rsquo;re second only to Alaska. Unfortunately, there is a water crisis in Pennsylvania, and a united voice of citizens is needed to press back and remind our federal legislators that funding for clean water is non-negotiable. Six million Americans rely on the Susquehanna River for their drinking water, but that has been put at risk. Elected officials have failed to protect the water we drink by failing to protect our waters and streams, and as a result, Pennsylvania ranks third in most reported drinking water violations.</p>

<p>We have a constitutional responsibility to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and that includes protecting and maintaining our rivers and streams.</p>

<p>We must support a responsible budget and EPA&rsquo;s role in protecting the Susquehanna and the Bay. We must remind our Representative and Senators that we oppose President Trump&rsquo;s plan to slash the Chesapeake Bay Program budget and support the recent Senate bill to fully restore the $73 million for the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean water depends on it.</p>

November Snapshot: Chesapeake Bay Clean-Up Efforts,11/28/2017,"<p>It has been a busy autumn in terms of addressing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s water quality challenges.</p>

<p>Since the kick-off of the Steering Committee for the Watershed Implementation Plan&rsquo;s Phase III in early June and the large success of Penn State University&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ag Progress Days&rsquo; in August, stakeholders and voices for clean water across the Commonwealth have provided critical feedback and scores of public comments to the PA Department of Environmental Protection on how and what to address with the Chesapeake Bay clean-up.</p>

<p><strong>In late August, the Wolf administration rolled-out an announcement regarding the first year of the Chesapeake Bay Agricultural Inspections Program and wrote about how the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, in partnership with Pennsylvania&rsquo;s conservation districts, &ldquo;not only exceeded federal expectations for numbers of acres inspected, but also found that a majority of farms are complying with state planning requirements.&rdquo; </strong>The executive branch agencies working on the current Chesapeake Bay clean-up efforts should be lauded for their 60 percent farm inspection completion rate, but this means about 40 percent of the Keystone State&rsquo;s 60,000 farms have yet to be inspected. This means that more than three million acres of agriculture land has gone the last year without ascertaining whether these properties are compliant with conservation and maintenance requirements. With yet another shaky and delayed state budget this year &ndash; at times agriculture preservation and conservation dollars in jeopardy &ndash; these missed opportunities underscore the importance of increased staffing and funding in our state agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Through September and October, the WIP Steering Committee met regularly to start to answer the larger questions and establish the stage for the development of the Watershed Implementation Plan.</strong> Key workgroups on funding, agriculture, wastewater, stormwater, forestry, and local area goals, priorities, and practices have begun to meet in earnest. As Pennsylvania&rsquo;s WIP Steering Committee has begun to dig deeper to address current water quality challenges, a few members reflected on the experience of Phases I &amp; II. Chief among these reflections were that Pennsylvania policymakers, in Phase III, should break down the larger target numbers of the EPA expectations to a more local, and tangible level. It was also recommended that the third phase, helping Pennsylvania meet its TMDL pollution reduction goals by 2025, should ensure that the current local water cleanup efforts be accurately tracked and the data shared with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Perhaps the clearest proposal to keep in mind moving forward is the need to identify the value (economic, cultural, spiritual, aesthetic, etc.) and stacked benefits of cleaning up our local waters.</strong> In reports this fall presented at the Susquehanna River Symposium at Bucknell University, hosted by the Susquehanna River Heartland Coalition for Environmental Studies, the University of Michigan and Penn State University state that, when we monetize and think in terms of economic value of a natural resource, the Susquehanna River Basin is worth nearly $2 billion annually. Investing in our watershed should not be about the Bay, but instead about restoration and stewardship of our own waters. As an Amish farmer from Lancaster County told me this fall, &ldquo;Our conservation is not about meeting requirements &ndash; it&rsquo;s all about taking care of our home.&rdquo; The cost of inaction far outweighs the abundant benefits of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s renowned outdoor recreation, beverage industry, sustainable agriculture, energy, and forestry, and clean water supply.</p>

<p><strong>What remains to be clear is that Pennsylvania is far behind in meeting its pollution reduction goals for nitrogen, phosphorous, and sedimentation.</strong> Thanks to generous help and leadership provided by the University of Maryland, United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC), and the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program, Pennsylvania stakeholders, policymakers, and members of the WIP Steering Committee are starting to understand the way forward better. Large-scale and in-depth efforts are underway to collect and analyze data in order to create local water cleanup plans with the greatest possible impacts and it has become a priority of the groups at play to focus on the top load-producing watersheds.</p>

<p><strong>A newly released report entitled &ldquo;Boots on the Ground&rdquo; from the Chesapeake Bay Commission further points out the severe need for more technical assistance to farmers implementing best management practices in the Bay watershed &ndash; including Pennsylvania &ndash; along with increased need for incentives and funding.</strong> As 2017 begins to draw to a close, EPA Chesapeake Bay Program staff are starting to determine how Pennsylvania is doing and what actions must &ndash; and should &ndash; be taken to get the state on track again for 2025. The TMDL mid-point assessment does not look good for Pennsylvania, and that is before we think about other factors inhibiting progress that are knocking on our door: addressing climate change&rsquo;s effects on the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the Conowingo Dam issue, the potential impairment of the lower Susquehanna, pipeline infrastructure, and development and forest fragmentation taking place at rapid paces.</p>

<p><strong>And this all brings us back to the age-old problem in Penns Woods: funding.</strong> While the state budget dilemma for FY2017-18 has been resolved, albeit four months overdue, state dollars for conservation practices and staffing at our state agencies charged with clean water responsibilities seem to be cut on an annual basis. Members of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s General Assembly have dug in their heels on not investing in and prioritizing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean water and next year&rsquo;s budget process is likely to be slow coming, as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As this Watershed Implementation Plan process continues to unfold, make sure to take a stand for clean water. Follow our upcoming regular blogs on the WIP, frequent check-ins on the Bay watershed clean-up and upcoming policies we&rsquo;re pushing.

What You Need to Know in Advance of the Issuance of DRBC’s Fracking Regulations,11/27/2017,"<p>The Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) has directed its staff to issue regulations regarding unconventional natural gas extraction activities, namely, the horizontal, hydraulic fracturing method, also known as fracking,&nbsp;within the Delaware River watershed.&nbsp;Those draft regulations are to be issued no later than this Thursday, Nov.&nbsp;30.</p>

<p><strong>This blog post is intended to provide you with background information and to prepare you for the upcoming public commenting period.&nbsp;We want everyone to be engaged to protect the Delaware River from the environmental and human health risks posed by fracking.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Brief History of DRBC&rsquo;s Regulation of Fracking</strong><br />
<a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Moratorium-on-Fracking-in-the-Delaware-River-Basin-is-Critical-to-Protect-Our-Water"">We recently wrote about how the DRBC&rsquo;s long-standing moratorium on fracking is critical to protecting the Basin&rsquo;s resources.</a>&nbsp;In that blog, we briefly discussed why the DRBC was formed and what it does to protect the Delaware River.&nbsp;We also explained how the&nbsp;7-year &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; moratorium came to pass. We concluded by pointing out that DRBC had identified specific and serious concerns about the risk of harm posed by unconventional natural gas development in the Basin, and has held off on allowing such risky extraction unless and until it can ensure the protection of the water resources of Basin. Considering the precious nature of the Basin&rsquo;s resources, and the possible long-term impact that natural gas development can have on water resources, PennFuture supports a permanent ban on fracking in the Basin.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What to Expect</strong><br />
The DRBC will draft regulations prohibiting the production of natural gas via fracking within the Basin, but will allow other fracking-related activities to occur within the watershed.&nbsp;In particular, the DRBC will allow both (1) the storage, treatment, disposal, and/or discharge of fracking wastewater within the Basin, and (2) the transfer of Delaware River water outside of the Basin for use in fracking.&nbsp;Both of these activities have the very real possibility of impacting both the water quality and water quantity of the Delaware River, and&nbsp;these are the regulations that PennFuture is most concerned about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the draft regulations come out, we expect an in-depth review of the regulations regarding fracking wastewater and inter-basin water transfers will be needed.&nbsp;Based on our 2010 review&nbsp;of the then-draft DRBC regulations, we anticipate that the regulations will not be strong enough to sufficiently protect the critical headwaters and wetlands of the Delaware River.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point, it is unclear how long the public comment period will be, but PennFuture expects it to be at least several months, since DRBC has indicated its intent to hold several public hearings throughout the Basin.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do</strong><br />
As we review the draft regulations and the public comment process moves forward, PennFuture will be providing you with information and ways to get involved to protect the Delaware River Basin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/donate"">please consider supporting PennFuture&rsquo;s efforts</a> to protect the sensitive, high-quality headwaters of the Delaware River Basin.&nbsp;</p>

Making a Difference with Momentum,11/27/2017,"<p>This month has turned out to be an extraordinary time for all of us who care deeply about our environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We are beginning to see important shifts in power, both in the political realm and in the realm of our democracy in action.</strong> These shifts must become more pronounced, and must be sustained if we are to win back the safeguards that ensure cleaner air and water. The attempted theft of these hard-won laws, regulations and rights seems finally to be slowing. It is up to all of us to continue the fight, and hasten the shift back to a sane and balanced Commonwealth, where citizens can determine their clean energy future, assisted by responsible elected officials.</p>

<p>Thanks to the diligent and inspiring leadership of PennFuture&rsquo;s former director of policy, recently named Vice President and Chief of Staff Matt Stepp, along with Joanne Kilgour, director of the Pennsylvania Chapter of Sierra Club, and other groups active on the legislative front, we saw a near-disastrous state budget season turn net-positive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Not only was the environmental community able to fight off horrendous proposals to fundamentally change the state&rsquo;s approach to environmental permitting, and to stop raids on environmental funding, we had a win. </strong>We secured legislation to &ldquo;close the borders&rdquo; on solar credits. This means that solar energy that gets counted towards Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean energy goals must be generated within our state, somewhat incentivizing solar production right here at home. These measures were fought and won with the help of a cohesive and core group of pro-environmental legislators, who&nbsp; joined with PennFuture in taking a firm stand against the antis, holding that first line of defense, and perhaps for the first time, hanging tough as a core group to win the day.</p>

<p><strong>This month also saw diverse and pro-environmental candidates winning in the general election. </strong>A former Riverkeeper is now mayor of York. Every one of the candidates endorsed by our partner organization, Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, prevailed, and my colleague there, CVPA Executive Director Josh McNeil, is ready to bring more environmentally friendly candidates into the critical 2018 elections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In Western Pennsylvania, PennFuture&rsquo;s Toxic Neighbor campaign had material impact on holding to account the most egregious air polluter in the region &ndash; U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Clairton Coke Works.</strong>&nbsp;Recently joining me in speaking before the Allegheny County Health Department board and staff were a group of tenacious, smart and strategic community leaders who have been fighting for cleaner air in Pittsburgh for many years. Volunteer leaders with powerful messages are emerging through this campaign, including East End resident Lisa Minetti, <a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2017/11/12/Reality-check-Pittsburgh-s-air-is-still-highly-toxic/stories/201711120024"">who joined forces with PennFuture to write an op-ed that appeared in the Sunday edition of the Nov. 12th Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</a> Lisa&rsquo;s voice, our collective work, and this campaign is beginning to make a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, <a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2017/11/14/US-Steel-Edgar-Thomson-mill-Pittsburgh-Braddock-on-notice-pollution-equipment-violations-EPA-ACHD/stories/201711140148"">we saw a glimpse of leadership</a> from the Allegheny County Health Department and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency when the agencies issued a notice of violation to U.S. Steel around another abomination in our right to clean air, the Edgar Thomson steel mill. <a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2017/11/19/Something-in-the-air-Violations-cannot-stand-at-local-U-S-Steel-plant/stories/201711300023"">And on Sunday, Nov. 19, we saw the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette state in an editorial that these continued air quality violations by U.S. Steel &ldquo;cannot stand.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Finally, emerging from the COP23 Climate Change Conference is a very important group of Pennsylvania mayors from Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Allentown, Ambler, Bethlehem, Easton, Ferguson Township, Lancaster, Swarthmore and West York Borough. These mayors have stated their commitment to support local climate action in the absence of federal and state leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is the tide truly turning?&nbsp; Do we have the collective will and energy to keep this momentum going? Can we beat back the next volley of anti-environmental measures that the legislature will surely try to put in place to protect the interest of the fossil fuel industry? Will more pro-environment leaders emerge in communities, to speak out, or stand for elected office? Will more climate-conscious mayors take their communities&rsquo; clean energy future into their own hands and stand with the Paris Climate Agreement? Will more elected officials join that core of pro-climate and pro-public health legislators and fight alongside PennFuture? The answer must be yes.</p>

<p>As I transition from running PennFuture, as its former Chief Operating Officer, to leading PennFuture as its president,&nbsp; I want you to know that I, and the rest of the staff, are privileged to lead the state&rsquo;s top watchdog for clean air, water and a healthy climate.&nbsp;Every day, we embrace our work, and the trust you have in us, with energy, passion and seriousness. We know you look to us for leadership, and turn to us for good information and assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Know that we look to you, too, for inspiration. </strong>You are making a difference with every vote you cast, every letter you write, every conversation you have with your family, friends or colleagues. With every check you write supporting PennFuture, with every solar panel you install, or light bulb you change out, and with your social media activism, you make a difference. So, keep up the good work, and I assure you that we at PennFuture will do the same.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Environmental Impacts and the PennEast Pipeline,11/14/2017,"<p><em>PennFuture Staff Attorney Abigail M. Jones is pictured.</em></p>

<p>Last Thursday, a local Carbon County environmental organization hosted a press conference to bring to light concerns surrounding the anticipated approval of the PennEast pipeline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Save Carbon County Coalition, along with PennFuture and the Lehigh Gap Nature Center, gave testimony on this issue at the Carbon County Courthouse Annex building in Jim Thorpe, PA after the commissioners meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The group is anticipating that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), will give PennEast pipeline the certificate it needs to proceed with the pipeline construction following a meeting scheduled for Dec.&nbsp;21.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this in mind, Save Carbon County President Linda Christman organized this press conference to highlight the environmental impacts that will follow pipeline construction. The impacts include clear cutting trees in Carbon County, treats to waterways and wildlife, along with eminent domain struggles for landowners. Save Carbon County will be holding frequent meetings with landowners to inform them of their rights at every step of the Eminent Domain process.</p>

<p>Lehigh Gap Nature Center&rsquo;s program specialists Chad Schwartz and Brian Birchak spoke about the clear cutting trees issues and how it will affect farmland, wetlands, and invite invasive species to inhabit the area. Clear cutting trees will create an edge for the regional/ native species that live in the area. This &ldquo;edging&rdquo; will offer space for invasive species, such as the spotted lantern fly and tree of heaven to take over the clear cut areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While PennFuture has many concerns with the increased pipeline infrastructure in Pennsylvania &ndash; including climate change and cumulative environmental impacts &ndash; our focus is on the price that our environment and individual landowners are forced to pay as a result, even before the pipeline route is finalized,&rdquo; said Abigail M. Jones, PennFuture Staff Attorney. &ldquo;In our state, we are seeing an alarming lack of protection for the environment at the hands of the expansion of natural gas pipelines&hellip; it is estimated that Pennsylvania could have upwards of 10,000 miles of Marcellus Shale gas pipelines crisscrossing the state by the end of the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jones also highlighted: &ldquo;Our environmental rights are as fundamental as our right to free speech. Yet DEP&rsquo;s pipeline policy fails to protect our environmental rights from pipeline construction and &lsquo;pre-construction&rsquo; activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PennFuture, Save Carbon County, and Lehigh Gap Nature Center came together to educate the public and bring to light major concerns about the clear cutting process during preconstruction of the PennEast pipeline. This not only affects wildlife and nature, but the pipeline and tree clear cutting will affect the natural, scenic, historic, and aesthetic values to the environment throughout Carbon County and the rest of the PennEast pipeline route&nbsp;that brings economically valued tourism and a beautiful place to live in the Lehigh Valley and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

Goat Rodeo Farm Awareness Dinner Shines Light on RESPECTAgZone,11/7/2017,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/respectagzone%2EJPG"" style=""width: 400px; height: 606px;"" /></p>

<p><em><a href=""http://goatrodeocheese.com/"">Goat Rodeo Farm and Dairy</a> is a member of <a href=""https://www.respectagzone.org/"">RESPECTAgZone</a>, a committed, passionate group of homeowners, businesses, farms and neighbors in the heart of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Members of the group live in the Agricultural Zone of Indiana Township, a decades old community with ordinances that protect the agricultural way of life, and preserve one of the last remaining areas of its kind for all. <strong>PennFuture&#39;s legal team is representing <a href=""https://www.respectagzone.org/"">RESPECTAgZone</a> in an effort to protect the land.</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Superior Motors restaurant in Braddock is hosting an awareness fundraiser dinner featuring Goat Rodeo Farm &amp; Dairy&#39;s cheeses on Nov. 14. <a href=""https://www.superiormotors15104.com/articles/we-love-what-we-do-at-goat-rodeo-farm-and-dairy--raising"">Click here for more details.</a></em></p>

<p>We love what we do at Goat Rodeo Farm and Dairy - raising our 100+ goats and making award-winning cheeses that people across Pennsylvania and the region love.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what you can accomplish in a few years. We have a beautiful, 130-acre farm located in a designated Agricultural Zone (AgZone) in Indiana Township, just 10 miles and a short 20-minute ride north of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p><strong>We worked hard to secure this designation. But today, Duquesne Light Company (DLC) is planning new construction of high-power transmission lines and monopoles for its northern region. Our AgZone falls within two routes under consideration.</strong></p>

<p>RESPECTAgZone is a community group of people who work and live in Indiana Township&rsquo;s Agricultural Zone. We&rsquo;re strongly opposed to Duquesne Light&rsquo;s routes that cross the AgZone because it will devastate our businesses, recreation areas and the environment.</p>

<p><strong>There is a viable alternate route that makes use of current rights of way and infrastructure corridors, and we&rsquo;re petitioning DLC to proceed with construction along this eastern route that follows the Pennsylvania Turnpike north to the West Deer area. It is an environmentally conscious route that will save small businesses like ours, recreation areas used by thousands, and 1,000 acres of agricultural land.</strong></p>

<p>The RESPECTAgZone community organization is doing everything possible to persuade DLC of the Pennsylvania Turnpike route. Turnpike engineers have told us they believe it is a viable, good route. And our state legislator and Turnpike officials are also supportive.</p>

<p>We welcome your support, too! Please visit <a href=""https://www.respectagzone.org/"">www.RespectAgZone.org</a> to learn more and sign our online petition to save this treasured farmland, a short 20-minute drive to the city. Also, we invite you to write to State Senator Randy Vulakovich and State Representative Frank Dermody to let them know this issue is important to you and it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. You can also copy Jessica Rock and Zach Merritt of Duquesne Light on your letters.</p>

Five Years After Superstorm Sandy,11/6/2017,"<p>On Tuesday, Oct.&nbsp;31, PennFuture commemorated the fifth anniversary of Superstorm Sandy by hosting a statewide telepresser exploring the relationship between climate change and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.</p>

<p>Larry J. Schweiger, President Emeritus, and Rob Altenburg, Director of the PennFuture Energy Center, discussed the climate impacts of governmental inaction as well as the enormous costs that taxpayers bear in the wake of increasingly severe weather events.</p>

<p>During the call, Schweiger addressed the combination of massive and widespread damage from this season&rsquo;s hurricanes, along with the California wildfires that were exacerbated by a warmer climate, and caused FEMA and other governmental emergency response groups to be strained financially and operationally.</p>

<p>Schweiger highlighted that over the past decade, the government has spent $350 billion responding to extreme weather and fire events, made worse by climate change, according to a <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/extreme-weather-climate-change-costing-taxpayers-billions-n813431"" target=""_blank"">recent report from the Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO). Additionally, as regulations are rolled back and our climate response is effectively halted, the cost of these storms will only increase.</p>

<p>Altenburg provided his expertise around environmental, climate, and energy policy that are essential to advancing clean energy solutions for Pennsylvania, and highlighted recent work in the state to improve our energy profile and move us towards a renewable future.</p>

<p>Altenburg&nbsp; also gave updates on the state of solar in PA and pointed to the Finding PA&rsquo;s Solar Future project as an ongoing effort by PennFuture to find a pathway to achieving 10 percent of our in-state generation from solar power by 2030.</p>

<p>Thank you to our speakers and to all who attended. You can find the recording for the event below.</p>

What It Means to Live Near Big Polluters,11/1/2017,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/Blaine%2Dand%2DLisa%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 562px; height: 750px;"" /></p>

<p>We moved to Pittsburgh for many reasons: a slower pace of life, the kind of friends who will linger after dinner, and the chance to have a backyard garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fifteen months into this Pittsburgh life, we have all of that and more. Unfortunately, there was one surprise that wasn&#39;t so welcome. Two days after landing here last July, we awoke to crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Lisa, my wife, woke up with an asthma attack and a splitting headache. </strong>I woke up to the sound of her slamming the windows shut to our home in the East End. We hadn&#39;t yet unpacked the HEPA filter that we brought from New York. What was that smell? It was a blend of rotten eggs and burning metal. Whatever it was, we knew we had a big problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;The smell,&rdquo; as we have come to call it, is most noticeable early in the morning hours, and it is often weakened by noon. Beyond the nuisance of smelly air, this pollution gives Lisa respiratory distress and headaches. Exercising outdoors on a bad air morning is out of the question, and sometimes we have to cancel preplanned activities when bad air comes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Our experiences led us to start investigating just what was producing this polluted air. Our search led us to the <a href=""http://www.achd.net/air/enforcement.html"">Allegheny County Health Department website</a>, which showed that there are four non-compliant industrial facilities in the county.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The smoking gun in our research was PennFuture&#39;s investigation, finding 6,700 Clean Air Act violations by one of these facilities, Clairton Coke Works, in a 3.5 year period. During this period, Clairton Coke Works&#39; violations average to more than five air quality violations per day.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>We know that the Allegheny County Health Department has repeatedly fined Clairton Coke Works for air quality violations. These fines have not stopped the violations or the resulting public health crisis. <strong>When a facility commits 6,700 air quality violations in 3.5 years, that suggests an operating strategy more than a series of accidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>PennFuture is a leader in the movement to help make sure our elected and appointed officials represent the environmental interests of the millions of people imperiled by industrial pollution in our community. <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/ToxicNeighborPgh""><strong>We first noticed PennFuture&#39;s Toxic Neighbor Campaign</strong></a> as a Facebook ad focused on the Clairton Coke Works. <strong>We were so inspired that the campaign was addressing the two most pressing local air quality issues &ndash; <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/ToxicNeighborPgh"">the long emergency of the Clairton Coke Works</a> and the impending emergency of the <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/toxicneighbor"">Shell Ethane Cracker Plant in Beaver County</a> &ndash; that we immediately sent a donation to help PennFuture amplify this campaign.</strong> PennFuture has been doing great work across the state for decades, and it is great to see them taking on some of our most significant environmental threats in Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the history of the coking and steel industry is one of flagrant local air pollution. <a href=""http://[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Donora_smog"">During the 1948 Donora Smog</a>, 20 people died as a result of U.S. Steel&#39;s Hydrogen Fluoride and Sulfur Dioxide emissions, accumulating during a 4-day weather inversion. The disaster was partly limited by cooperation between local officials and plant managers who agreed that the plants had to be shut down for the duration of the weather inversion. Where is this kind of cooperation today?</p>

<p>Seventy years later, the air is cleaner in Pittsburgh than it was in the 1940&#39;s, but far from acceptable. In the 1940&#39;s, Mayor David Lawrence and banker Richard Mellon worked together to help check a smoke problem that was wildly out of control. Thanks in part to them, that coal door in my basement goes unused, and I don&#39;t have to change my shirt mid-day due to sooty air.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, we have the Clean Air Act and a better scientific and medical understanding of the health effects of emissions from coke and steel making. <strong>Unfortunately, we also have a situation in which industrial polluters can continue to pay fines to operate outside of Clean Air Act standards.</strong></p>

<p>The Allegheny County Health Department, ACHD Director Dr. Karen Hacker, and County Executive Rich Fitzgerald must lead us as David Lawrence and Richard Mellon did in the 1940&#39;s.&nbsp;They must act more aggressively to stop the toxic emissions that harm our most vulnerable populations, up to and including revoking emissions permits for non-compliant facilities. Until they do, Pittsburgh and Allegheny County will fall short of its potential to be a great, healthy place to live.&nbsp;</p>

PennFuture's New CEO: Jacquelyn Bonomo,10/30/2017,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/Jacquelyn%2DBonomo%2DPhoto%2DCredit%2DBrandon%2DReefer%2D2017%2EJPG"" style=""width: 800px; height: 532px;"" /></p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Leadership-Transition-Announced"">Last week, I became president and CEO</a> of PennFuture, a 20-year-old statewide organization fighting for your rights to clean air, pure water, and a healthy climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d use this blog post to briefly introduce myself to you. I also want to personally thank everyone who supports PennFuture through activism or financial support. We will always need more of both, and I will strive to say thank you over and over again along the way, if I am lucky enough to meet you in person, and through these notes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hail from northeastern Pennsylvania, the anthracite coal region &ndash; Hazleton to be exact. I grew up surrounded by family &ndash; five of the seven houses on my block were occupied by my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins, and at one point, I could count more than 200 family members living in the Hazleton area. The view from our upstairs window was one of coal breakers, abandoned mineland, strip mines and even a steam shovel or two. Several of my uncles were active with the United Mine Workers and worked oiling the buckets at the end of the behemoth shovels&rsquo; arms. One of my uncles died tragically when ground underneath the steam shovel he was operating gave way. I was too young to absorb the breadth of this tragedy, which occurred around the same time that &ldquo;hard coal&rdquo; began to see its demise in the early 1960&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I left Hazleton the day after high school graduation to begin college at Penn State&rsquo;s main campus and soon began hiking, and doing a little birdwatching. That was the start of my real love of the outdoors and the wanderlust that has taken me to so many special parts of our state, the country, and beyond. After graduating from Penn State with a degree in English, I lived out west for a spell, working in Arizona and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where I ski bummed and became a river guide. After returning to my hometown, being outdoors and in nature as much as I could was a part of my essence as a person, and I spent a lot of my time around the Nescopeck Creek. The area&rsquo;s array of wildlife, natural communities and unique flora revealed itself to me in so many special experiences and observations over the many hours I spent there. I fell unabashedly in love with the place and could not believe I grew up so close to it, truly appreciating it all for the first time at the age of 26.</p>

<p><strong>My heart was broken when I learned that the state had plans to flood the valley of the Nescopeck, and condemn those gorgeous bottomland forests, wetlands, and miles upon miles of brook trout habitat to watery oblivion. I said to myself: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let them do it.&rdquo; And that was the day I became an activist, sometimes warrior, for our environment. I was able to build a large coalition of local, regional and national sportsmen and wildlife groups, supported by a list of state and national natural resource agencies with missions to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nature and biodiversity, and together, we stopped the dam at what is today Nescopeck State Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In the early days of that fight, I met Larry Schweiger, who I now succeed as PennFuture&rsquo;s president. Larry offered me my first professional position in the environmental field, and I joined him at National Wildlife Federation&rsquo;s Washington D.C. office as he became head of its national field operation. Since then, Larry and I have worked together twice more over my 32 year career. We collaborated when he brought me into Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, and most recently at PennFuture, where I served as executive vice president and chief operating officer prior to my promotion to CEO. I am humbled to be taking the baton from him&nbsp;at this critical time for our planet.</p>

<p>In the coming months and years, I will have much more to share with you about this amazing organization, PennFuture, and the work of my gifted staff and volunteers. For now, let me fast-forward five decades from when I looked out the window of my home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, when I peer out the window of my parents&rsquo; home in Hazleton, the mineland in the foreground of my view just this past year has been reclaimed, and the dangerous pits are filled in, graded, and covered with warm season grasses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, I know that at the base of the next ridge over, Nescopeck Creek flows freely, and the next ridge further west of the Susquehanna River is making its way to Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And while there is so much more work to be done &ndash; another part of the Nescopeck Creek receives the largest mine drainage on the east coast, and the Susquehanna River is being used to cool Talen Energy&rsquo;s Susquehanna Nuclear Power Plant -- let me tell you what lies on the furthest ridge out that I can see.</p>

<p>I see a long line of wind turbines, churning out renewable, clean energy: a symbol of our future, our children&rsquo;s future and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Future.&nbsp;</p>

Time for Solar,10/27/2017,"<p>On Saturday, Oct. 14, we joined a bus tour hosted by PennFuture and sponsored by Levin Furniture that featured three homes in the Pittsburgh area with solar power.</p>

<p>The first house was a solar passive house that made maximum efficient use of &quot;free&quot; energy from the sun.</p>

<p>The second house had a double array of 40 solar panels in the backyard of a homeowner who is driving an electric car (Nissan Leaf) and also has two electric Tesla&#39;s ordered. He can fill-up at home for &quot;free!&quot;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/bob1%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 750px; height: 422px;"" /></p>

<p>The third house featured 16 solar roof panels that provided about half their electric needs during most months of the year. Like the previous homeowners, they were very excited about their role in reducing air pollution and dependency on fossil fuels, while adding some energy independence to their own lives.</p>

<p>According to our tour guide, there is still time to save money on solar installations with a 30-percent federal tax credit extending through the end of 2019, while a reduced tax credit extends a year or two beyond that.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/bob2%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 750px; height: 422px;"" /></p>

<p>Beyond the immediate benefits to the environment, homeowners estimate their investments will reach the financial break even point in 15 years.</p>

<p>Most of the panels have a 30-year guarantee and the average installation cost per roof panel is approximately $1,000 (before the 30% federal tax credit). Ground arrays cost more due the extra cost of posts and supports.</p>

<p>Imagine the beauty of lower electric bills while benefiting the environment, a win-win!</p>

Meet the Donor: Joseph Morinville – EIS Solar,10/27/2017,"<p>As PennFuture celebrated its 7th Annual Pittsburgh Solar Tour, which was held Oct. 14, I had the opportunity to speak with one of our long-time donors who has supported the event for several years &ndash; Joe Morinville of Energy independent Solutions (EIS Solar).</p>

<p>Joe is originally from Minnesota and came to Pittsburgh when he met and married a local lady! While he originally missed his hometown, he told me, &ldquo;Now you couldn&rsquo;t drag me out of here. I love Pittsburgh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked him why he started his business and what made him interested in renewable energy.&nbsp; Joe said there were two main events that turned him on to all things solar and renewable.&nbsp; The first was when he was a high school student back in Minnesota. His dad was interested in solar and Joe found himself taking a solar training course. He thought it was the coolest technology and really liked how it worked.</p>

<p>But in the early 2000&rsquo;s, the second event happened that really strengthened Joe&rsquo;s resolve.&nbsp; He and his wife were looking for some property to build a home in the Pittsburgh area and thought they had found the perfect place.&nbsp; But Joe noticed that the ponds on the beautiful property looked strange and sadly, he found out that the ponds were heavily contaminated.&nbsp; Doing some more research, Joe learned that the property had been owned by a coal company that had strip mined it and then went bankrupt.&nbsp; The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection had been brought in to do a cleanup not once, but three times.&nbsp; Joe and his wife decided not to build their home there.&nbsp; Even today, Joe told me, the land is still vacant and unusable because of its legacy with chemical waste that remains in the water and surrounding ground.</p>

<p>All of that led Joe to really think about the impact and legacy of coal.&nbsp; It was not cheap, he thought.&nbsp; The cleanup costs and health impacts were enormous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He then became involved in Oil Free Farms (O.F.F.), a nonprofit, before starting EIS in 2008. He had been in financial services for 11 years but was very interested in farming.&nbsp; He always liked agriculture and that combined with clean energy led him to the idea of farmers growing their own energy!&nbsp; He wanted to help farmers become more energy efficient and he began working with a team of folks on biomass projects.</p>

<p>One evening, he and his team were in a discussion group and a large general contractor came in and asked Joe&rsquo;s group to do an audit of their building.&nbsp; It turned out that the Massaro group wanted solar on their building, but as Joe said, at the time, he was not certified to do that. Rising to the challenge, Joe changed direction.&nbsp; He went from nonprofit to for-profit, got himself certified to do solar work, and EIS Solar was born! He&rsquo;s never looked back.</p>

<p>One of the projects he is very proud of&mdash;he calls it the quintessential project for EIS Solar &ndash; was at Phipps Conservatory.&nbsp; At the time, EIS Solar was small and many believed he and his team didn&rsquo;t have the capacity to complete the job. Joe would go to events and people would come up to him and say &ldquo;If you and your team can finish at Phipps&hellip;&rdquo; and he would always respond, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t fail.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Joe knew they had to prove themselves, and they did. They have also worked on Phase 2 and Phase 3 at Phipps Conservatory&rsquo;s Living Building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>EIS Solar has completed work on five Living Building projects. Those types of buildings are harder to do than regular LEED buildings in terms of code compliance because the building has to create all of its own energy and clean its own water.</p>

<p>Joe says what makes his renewable work so gratifying is: &ldquo;our people.&rdquo;&nbsp; EIS Solar has assembled a team of phenomenal individuals &ndash; local to Pittsburgh &ndash; whose quality and workmanship is fantastic.&nbsp; His team, he said with pride, is the secret to their success.</p>

<p>From a clean energy perspective, Joe reminded me, you never accomplish all of your goals, but EIS Solar is where they want to be at this point in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I asked him about what he hoped for the future of clean energy, Joe said, &ldquo;EIS Solar is always pursuing the cutting edge of things and we make sure we can build the most beautiful functional projects.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he noted Harrisburg is all about policy &ndash; and all the policy and all the technology in the world do not make clean energy &ndash; you have to actually build it!</p>

<p>Joe, thank you and your team for your clean energy leadership and your support!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re glad you are standing with us.</p>

ACE Program Volunteers Engage Legislators on Environmental Issues,10/13/2017,"<p>After the 2017 presidential election, Brian Polilli knew he needed to get involved in the democratic process to make a difference on environmental issues &ndash; he just wasn&rsquo;t sure where to turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Post-election, I was pretty aggravated about the direction of the country and since then, we have seen a lot of environmental standards being relaxed. The global warming issue is something we can&rsquo;t continue to drag our feet on,&rdquo; Polilli said. &ldquo;I have always been concerned about these issues and the election motivated me to take a further look at what I could do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he found PennFuture&rsquo;s newly created Advocates for Conservation and the Environment (ACE) Program, he discovered an outlet and the guidance needed to take the first steps to meet with his elected officials. This program enables volunteers to voice their concerns about environmental issues directly to their elected representatives in their home district offices.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s ACE program organizes teams of volunteers to educate their state and federal legislators about conservation and environmental issues. ACE volunteers provide policy makers with an opportunity to learn from concerned citizens who live in their respective districts about environmental and public health issues that affect their communities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;ACE committees meet with Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, to advocate policy rather than to advance an ideological agenda,&rdquo; said Jay Andrews, Ph.D, PennFuture&rsquo;s Director of Outreach. &ldquo;Such pragmatism is not just for show; it is an effective way to realize tangible benefits for our members, for the public, and for the environment. ACE is about policy, not partisanship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Polilli, 39, of Phoenixville, Pa., is a scientist with Johnson &amp; Johnson. As an ACE volunteer, he recently participated in two meetings that engaged State Rep. Becky Corbin&rsquo;s (R-155) office, and State Sen. John Rafferty&rsquo;s (R-44) office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These meetings are valuable no matter what happens. When you show your elected officials that enough people are concerned, it matters,&rdquo; Polilli said. &ldquo;We are trying to educate them and I learn something more as well in terms of the process. It helps when you participate in conversations and have experience with your elected official, rather than just reading about them in an article.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PennFuture outreach staff worked with Brian and other volunteers prior to the meeting, providing talking points and information about key environmental issues in his district, including education on methane pollution, watershed protection, and policy proposals that advance energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Polilli&rsquo;s biggest takeaway from the program is that the process is not as daunting as others may think. He is also more aware than ever that regular citizens need to voice their concerns about the environment to their elected officials to make sure progress is made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just assume the right thing is going to get done,&rdquo; Polilli said. &ldquo;That is frequently not the case. If you really believe certain things should be done, complaining about it on Facebook doesn&rsquo;t do anything. This is an opportunity. It is far less intimidating in the moment than you might think. These are professional people who are pleasant to talk to. If you go in to have a conversation, they will listen. If you know a little bit of information and are reasonably engaged on an issue, it&rsquo;s easy enough to talk about it.&rdquo;</p>

Join PennFuture's 7th Annual Solar Tour!,10/10/2017,"<p>Ever wonder how solar energy works in a city as cloudy as Pittsburgh? And even if it does work, is it affordable?</p>

<p><strong>All of your solar-related questions can be answered this Saturday, Oct. 14 at <a href=""http://pghsolartour.org/"">PennFuture&rsquo;s Seventh Annual Pittsburgh Solar Tour</a>, sponsored by Levin Furniture.</strong></p>

<p>During this event, you will have the chance to meet home and business owners who went solar for various reasons throughout the Greater Pittsburgh Area. For instance, Fred went solar to help fight climate change, Bryan wanted to save money on his electric bills, and Marybeth wanted a stronger energy approach for her family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Others on the tour went solar because their neighbor made the switch, which isn&rsquo;t an uncommon reason. In fact, two researchers at Yale and the University of Connecticut found the single most important factor driving people to go solar happened to be peer influence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the Pittsburgh Solar Tour&rsquo;s interactive online map, you can take a look to see if someone in your neighborhood went solar and get insight on how it works for their home. The Pittsburgh Solar Tour strives to make sure you have all of the resources available when making the decision to use clean energy from solar panels.</p>

<p>While homeowners will be able to talk about their perspective of what the process was like for them, and perhaps show you some recent energy bills, you will also have the opportunity to speak with various installers from companies including Energy Independent Solutions, Scalo Solar, and SolarCity. They will be able to explain and suggest if a solar loan or power-purchase agreement is a better fit for your needs.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s tour features: Phipps Conservatory, Homewood&rsquo;s Oasis Farm &amp; Fishery Bio Shelter, The Aquaponics Project at Repair the World, Levin Furniture&rsquo;s Wexford location, and the Telsa showroom in the North Hills of Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Solar Tour doesn&rsquo;t just promote solar energy. As Adam Haas of Phipps Conservatory states in our video, &ldquo;Sustainability isn&rsquo;t a destination, it&rsquo;s a journey. There&rsquo;s always something else to improve.&rdquo; By featuring other sustainable facets such as aquaponics and geothermal energy on the tour, even folks who have already switched to using solar panels can learn about next steps to take in their clean energy journeys.</p>

<p><strong>There are many different venues a person can take to participate in this year&rsquo;s tour. You can:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Take a free bus ride from noon to 2 p.m. and/or from 2 to 4 p.m. from the Frick Environmental Center, led by solar experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Join the guided 2 p.m. East End Bike Tour, led by Solarize Allegheny&rsquo;s Sharon Pillar. The tour will start at solar homeowner Fred Kraybill&rsquo;s house at 7211 Thomas Boulevard in Point Breeze and end at the East End Brewing Company.</li>
	<li>Download our free mobile app or use the online interactive map to do a self-guided tour</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Be sure to secure your spot and register at <a href=""http://pghsolartour.org"">pghsolartour.org</a>.</strong></p>

<p>This tour is&nbsp;timely as Environmental Protection Agency Chief&nbsp;Scott Pruitt recently announced,<a href=""http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/354594-epa-chief-id-do-away-with-wind-solar-tax-credits""> &ldquo;I would do away with these incentives that we give to wind and solar,&rdquo; </a>referring to solar&rsquo;s investment tax credit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s critical that we create more incentives for people to go solar, including better tax credits, rebates, performance payments, and property/sales tax exemptions as, solar only powers 5 percent of Pennsylvania. By participating in the Pittsburgh Solar Tour, we hope you&rsquo;ll see the enthusiasm these home and business owners possess and how we can continue to solarize Pennsylvania.</p>

PennFuture Opposes Any Repeal of the Clean Water Rule,9/27/2017,"<p>Today, <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/2017-09-27-PennFuture-Clean-Water-Rule-Repeal-Public-Comments-%28EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203%29.pdf""><strong>PennFuture submitted public comments </strong></a>urging the Trump Administration not to repeal the federal Clean Water Rule.&nbsp;Repealing the Clean Water Rule would threaten Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean water, outdoor economy, and safe drinking water for millions of citizens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of the Clean Water Rule is its protection of the sensitive, smaller waters critical to safeguarding water quality and wildlife throughout Pennsylvania.&nbsp;Small headwater streams and wetlands provide the greatest connections between land and water, trapping and storing nutrients, providing critical habitat, storing floodwaters, contributing to drinking water supplies, and filtering out pollutants. These streams are essential to protect drinking water; in Pennsylvania 58% of the streams that provide water for surface water intakes that supply public drinking water are intermittent, ephemeral, or headwater streams.&nbsp;But just as importantly, headwater streams have biological, chemical, and hydrologic connections to downstream waters.&nbsp;Scientific studies repeatedly demonstrate that the health of downstream lakes, rivers, and estuaries are directly tied to the health of their smaller headwater streams and wetlands.&nbsp; Leaving these critical headwaters vulnerable to pollution puts the health of all of our rivers and the communities that depend upon them at risk.</p>

<p>Case in point: according to a recent analysis, repealing the Clean Water Rule would result in a loss of Clean Water Act protections to 55% of all stream miles in the Delaware River Watershed.&nbsp;These intermittent, ephemeral, and headwater streams in the Delaware River Watershed provide not only clean drinking water but are also spots for outdoor recreation and esthetic enjoyment of the natural environment. A repeal of the Clean Water Rule would put all of this at risk.</p>

<p>And although Pennsylvania has the Clean Streams Law, which protects the &ldquo;waters of the Commonwealth,&rdquo; this federal Clean Water Act jurisdictional issue can directly impact water quality protections in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>For example, Section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires that any federally-permitted project that may discharge into a &ldquo;navigable waterway&rdquo; (the definition of which includes &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo;) cannot proceed unless the state certifies that the discharge will not violate state water quality standards.&nbsp; Quite simply, should the federal government narrow the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States,&rdquo; smaller but ecologically important streams and wetlands, which likely suffer greater impacts from these projects than larger waters, will lose this protection under the Clean Water Act.&nbsp; An important aspect of the 401 Water Quality Certification process is that states may deny a certification or impose conditions as part of its certification to ensure that the applicant complies with any applicable state law. These conditions then become a part of the federal permit.&nbsp; If a project avoids the need for state certification because the federal government narrows the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States,&rdquo; the states lose this ability to protect their waters by either denying the certification and halting the project or imposing federally-enforceable conditions to ensure that the project will not harm state water resources.</p>

<p>Additionally, and as a very practical matter, this loss of clear protection at the federal level for these critical headwaters and wetlands could result in the future weakening of protections in Pennsylvania as well, especially where the state environmental regulatory agency is so underfunded and under-staffed.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
PennFuture&rsquo;s comments made clear that we will not accept any repeal of the Clean Water Act protections that keep our waters, our economy, and our communities healthy.&nbsp;<br />
Background</p>

<p>Promulgated in 2015, the Clean Water Rule clarified the definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; under the federal Clean Water Act, and notably extended clean water protections for small, intermittent and ephemeral streams and wetlands that had a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; to traditionally navigable waters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2009 United States Supreme Court split decision in Rapanos v. United States, 547 U.S. 715 (2006) (&ldquo;Rapanos&rdquo;) left regulators and the regulated community confused about which waters fell under the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s jurisdiction because a majority of the Supreme Court did not agree on a definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Clean Water Rule sought to clarify this confusion by adopting a definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; that was consistent with Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy&rsquo;s opinion in Rapanos, which protected any waters that had a &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; to navigable streams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In adopting the Clean Water Rule, EPA engaged in an almost 7-month public comment period, met with over 400 stakeholders, and received over one million comments on the proposed rule, with over 87% of them in favor of the agencies&rsquo; proposal.&nbsp; More than 50,000 Pennsylvanians supported the Clean Water Rule, including business owners, local officials, farmers, and health professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>PennFuture strongly supported the Clean Water Rule because it not only protected the larger streams used directly for drinking water by millions of Pennsylvanians -- it also protected sensitive headwater streams and wetlands that makeup thousands of miles of streams in the Commonwealth.</p>

Meet the Donor: Dawn Gorsline,9/26/2017,"<p>When Dawn and Brian Gorsline purchased property in Fairfield Township, they were overjoyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1999, Dawn and Brian were looking for property that would allow them to build a home to raise a family in a healthy and safe environment - a place where they could conserve land, grow Christmas trees and watch generations of their family experience the beauty of nature at its fullest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their search led them to an area in Fairfield Township, Lycoming County, zoned Residential-Agriculture. Dawn had grown up in the area and her family still lived there. &ldquo;It was the perfect place with the best people living in it,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Little did she realize that several years after building her dream home, Dawn&rsquo;s desire to protect her family&rsquo;s way of life would involve her in a constitutional law case that would lead all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2013, a neighbor mentioned to Dawn that a company, Inflection Energy, was looking at locating a shale gas well pad near their homes, and that a township meeting had been scheduled.&nbsp;Dawn recalls the meeting. &ldquo;It was filled with angry people who had a lot of questions&quot; she said.&nbsp;It was at this meeting that she met one of PennFuture&rsquo;s legal team members, who, after studying the township&rsquo;s zoning ordinance, said, &ldquo;We have a case.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because the township&rsquo;s ordinance did not expressly regulate oil and gas development, in order to allow shale gas development in its R-A district, the township had to find that use of the land for construction and operation of a well pad was &ldquo;similar to and compatible&rdquo; with other land uses expressly allowed in the district.&nbsp;Despite opposition from those most impacted by the well, the township&rsquo;s board of supervisors approved use of the land to construct and operate the well pad. Within 3,000 feet of the pad were 126 drinking wells. The owner of the property on which the well pad would be located lived in another township. PennFuture, representing the Gorslines and their neighbors, the Batkowskis, challenged the township&rsquo;s decision in Common Pleas Court.</p>

<p>Dawn and her neighbors quickly experienced the impacts associated with construction of a gas well pad in a residential neighborhood.&nbsp;Seismic &ldquo;thumper&rdquo; trucks showed up unexpectedly; strangers with chainsaws appeared in backyards without permission; helicopters hovered overhead and dropped cables across those same properties. It generally felt like life had gone from predictable to chaos in a few short months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Inflection began constructing a holding pond for the well pad despite the pending appeal, PennFuture&#39;s legal team sprang into action and obtained an injunction to prevent further construction activities until the judge could rule on PennFuture&rsquo;s challenge.&nbsp;After deliberation, Judge Mark Lovvechio issued a decision in favor of the Gorslines and Batkowskis, reversing the township&rsquo;s conditional use application.&nbsp;Judge Lovvechio believed that Inflection had failed to show that the proposed land use was &ldquo;similar to and compatible with&quot; other land uses expressly allowed in the district.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, Inflection appealed its loss to the Commonwealth Court.&nbsp;After written and oral argument, a three-judge panel of the Court reversed the Common Pleas Court&rsquo;s decision.&nbsp;The opinion was extraordinary in that the Court held that an industrial land use that uses heavy machinery, large diesel engines, and involves the storage of highly flammable material, toxic waste and explosives, and generates waste characterized as industrial by the state of Pennsylvania, was &ldquo;similar to and compatible with&rdquo; other land uses expressly allowed in the R-A district, such as single family homes.&nbsp;The ruling effectively cut an exception in the zoning ordinance so wide that it would result in shale gas development being allowed everywhere, regardless of the nature of the zoning district.&nbsp;It was an outrageous demonstration of judicial overreach.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Not giving up, PennFuture sought allocator permission to have the case reviewed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Only a small percentage of these types of petitions are granted by the Court, but this one of them.&nbsp;The case presents for decision the issues of whether shale gas development constitutes an industrial land use, and whether the government violates the constitutional rights of existing property owners who relied on the township&rsquo;s zoning scheme by allowing incompatible land uses in the zoning district in which the residents reside.&nbsp;The case was argued on March 8, 2017.&nbsp;The case has the potential to establish statewide precedent on a number of important environmental and public health issues facing Pennsylvania.</strong></p>

<p>Dawn feels strongly that clean air and clean water should never be threatened and that we - all of us - need to fight for our basic rights to protect those natural resources and public health and safety. Dawn teaches third grade and environmental science at her primary school and regularly emphasizes to her students that &ldquo;wherever you step, there is life where you walk. You cannot just abuse the land and expect good results.&quot;</p>

PennFuture Celebrates New Poconos Location,9/25/2017,"<div>PennFuture clipped the ribbon of its newly opened office in the Northeast region of Pennsylvania on Sept. 21 with an open house event, inviting neighbors and fellow organizations to meet staff and supporters. Nestled in the heart of the Pocono Mountains, PennFuture is thrilled to have a new location in Mt. Pocono, Pa.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PennFuture holds a seat on the steering committee and also the state lead role for the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed (CDRW), which makes the new location a perfect home among the high quality and exceptional value headwaters of this mighty river.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PennFuture&rsquo;s Northeast PA Outreach Coordinator, Emily Rinaldi, and PennFuture&rsquo;s Staff Attorney, Abby Jones, are the team members working in the new location.</div>

<ul>
	<li>Emily focuses on watershed protection and clean energy, serving as the state lead for the Coalition of the Delaware River Watershed. She also focuses on community and coalition outreach on stormwater management, environmental policy revolving around pipelines and natural gas drilling, and ways to reduce water pollution in the region. Emily joined PennFuture in October 2016.</li>
	<li>Abby&rsquo;s work focuses on water quality and watershed protection, stormwater management, and public land and open space protection. Abby joined PennFuture in March 2017.&nbsp;</li>

Environmental Rights Amendment Forum Sparks Timely Conversation,9/25/2017,"<p>Nearly 200 citizens gathered on Sept. 14 at WHYY Studios in Philadelphia for PennFuture&rsquo;s &ldquo;Environmental Rights Amendment Forum.&rdquo; Attendees heard from legal experts, legislators, and current and former state officials who shared their perspectives on Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, an often-misunderstood provision commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Environmental Rights Amendment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Article I, Section 27 states: &ldquo;The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania&#39;s public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the course of the evening, Forum panelists stimulated thoughtful dialogue about what&rsquo;s at stake for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s citizens and illuminated for a general public audience what had been, for many that attended, an obscure legal issue. Forum panelists reflected on the historical context in which the Amendment emerged, explained relevant case law, discussed needed enforcement, and considered the future implications of the Amendment for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s citizens and environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The evening began with Franklin Kury, the former state legislator who conceived the Amendment in 1969 and helped shepherd it through enactment in 1971. Noting that the Amendment was a bi-partisan response to the environmental degradation scarring Pennsylvania as a result of unregulated industry, Kury expressed great satisfaction that, 46 years after enactment, the State Supreme Court, in its monumental PEDF decision this summer, finally read the plain language of the Amendment as originally intended, reinvigorating &nbsp;Article I, Section 27.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next, John Dernbach, Professor of Environmental Law and Sustainability at Widener University, walked the audience through the text of the amendment. In a concise yet engaging PowerPoint presentation, Professor Dernbach explained the nuances of each of the Amendment&rsquo;s three sentences, and how courts have construed them since 1971, culminating in the recent PEDF decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-How-the-Environmental-Rights-Amendment-Strengthens-Our-Impact""><strong>A panel of expert environmental attorneys then discussed the meaning and substance of Amendment case law since 1971</strong></a>, such as Payne v. Kassab, Robinson Township v. Commonwealth, and Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Fund v. Commonwealth. The panel focused on why PEDF is so significant, explaining that the Court has now said that the state does not own our public natural resources as a proprietor, but instead manages them as would a bank that manages funds in a trust.</p>

<p>Both the history and legal panels provided an ideal segue for a bi-partisan panel of state legislators, who considered the Court&rsquo;s assertion that the state has an &ldquo;affirmative obligation&rdquo; to prohibit the degradation, diminution, and depletion of public natural resources in Pennsylvania. Specifically, they addressed the Court&rsquo;s assertion that the state must act via the legislature to protect the environment as well as why so many legislators, despite the PEDF decision, remain reluctant to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, John Childe, the attorney in the PEDF case, and John Quigley, former Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Secretary, provided thoughtful insights about where we go from here. They asserted that, in the wake of PEDF, a new era of environmental legal victories may be near. To be sure, they, like all of the evening&rsquo;s panelists, elevated the conversation about a complex topic with a clarity and gravitas too often missing in public discussions about conservation and the environment.</p>

Update: Finding PA's Solar Future Project Moves Forward,9/19/2017,"<p>The<a href=""http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/SolarFuture/Pages/Finding-Pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-Solar-Future.aspx""><strong> Finding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future project</strong></a> is a collaborative effort between the U.S. Department of Energy and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. PennFuture is working closely with project partners and stakeholders to find a pathway to achieving 10 percent of our in-state generation from solar power by 2030.</p>

<p>On Sept. 14, we held our third stakeholder meeting at the Inn at Villanova in Radnor, PA. &nbsp;Among the 81 people who attend in person and 25 who participated through a webcast, we had representatives from the solar industry, electric utilities, government, academia, nonprofit groups, and consumers.</p>

<p>This meeting represented a transition. Our first two meetings put a lot of emphasis on the details of our scenario modeling and our projections for what markets will look like in the future. This session focused more on specific issues that were identified as &ldquo;pivotal factors&rdquo; for achieving 10 percent in-state solar generation by 2030.</p>

<p>Prior to this meeting, we held a webinar on alternative ratemaking where Karl Rabago, the &nbsp; Executive Director of Pace Energy and Climate Center; Eric Miller of the Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance; and &nbsp;Alan Cohn, Manager of Regulatory Strategy, at PECO discussed how different options for the rates we pay to electric utilities can impact the deployment of new technologies like solar.</p>

<p>At the in-person meeting, we had a panel discussion between Ethan Case of Cypress Creek Renewables and John McCawley of PECO Energy. This started the conversation on how solar generation will be split between large utility-scale installations and smaller distributed installations like rooftop solar systems. &nbsp;</p>

<p>While larger systems will continue to benefit from economies of scale and have lower installation costs in terms of dollars-per-watt, smaller distributed systems can still be cost-effective for consumers, &nbsp;are less subject to transmission losses, can help alleviate congestion, and can provide other benefits. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We also heard from our Keynote Speaker, Ken Schyuler of PJM, the Valley Forge based company that manages the electric grid for 13 states throughout the Midwest and mid-Atlantic and the District of Columbia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we move forward on our project, it will be critical that our pathways to increased solar generation consider the needs and the abilities of our power grid to provide reliable electricity throughout the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not too late to be part of the discussion.

How Can You Protect Lake Erie?,9/19/2017,"<p>On Saturday, Sept. 9, Erie residents gathered at Perry Monument Pavilion at Presque Isle State Park to discuss how to save a beloved body of water: Lake Erie.</p>

<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s Save Our Lake Erie event included everyone from Erie natives to young professionals who just moved to the area. The crowd was eager to learn about the environmental factors contributing to the degradation of Lake Erie and what they could do to alleviate these problems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lake Erie used to be the fishing capital in the United States, and now we&rsquo;ve found some fish species are endangered. Not only is Lake Erie a place for us to recreate, it&rsquo;s a place for us to protect. We must ask our state representatives to protect it for future generations,&rdquo; said Save Our Native Species (S.O.N.S.) of Lake Erie Fishing Club President, Jerry Skrypzak.</p>

<p>Several speakers addressed the crowd, including Jerry and myself, who spoke about an array of issues that need local, state, and national attention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We learned that bad policies such as the Renewable Fuel Standard needs reforming to decrease the amount of ethanol used in gasoline, which would decrease the phosphorous used in corn production, and therefore decrease the agricultural runoff into Lake Erie causing the toxic, green algal blooms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also learned from Steve Porter of NW Page that climate change is increasing the temperatures of our bodies of water, including Lake Erie, which makes it easier for these algal blooms to stay in the water even longer, exacerbating this environmental problem, hurting our drinking water and potentially harming thousands of marine life.</p>

<p>Lastly, Anna McCartney of the Pennsylvania Sea Grant spoke about the harmful effects that microbeads have on the fish within Lake Erie. Scientists have proven that toxic chemicals such as PAHs and PCBs can damage DNA and cause neurological damage in aquatic animals. With the use of microbeads in personal care products becoming more popular, it&rsquo;s more than likely that they will make its way into Lake Erie.</p>

<p>All of this can be extremely overwhelming for one person to digest. How can one person begin to tackle all of these issues that need collective action? I decided to break it down to an action list by issue:</p>

<p><strong>Reforming the Renewable Fuel Standard:&nbsp;</strong></p>

Be a Watershed Watchdog with New Pocket Guide,9/5/2017,"<div>Imagine yourself in this scenario: you&rsquo;re walking along a trail in your favorite park when you approach a creek. You decide to walk closer to the bank to admire the fish, insects, and plants surrounding the area when you notice that something doesn&rsquo;t seem right.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Instead of the cold clear water that you usually see in the creek, you notice the water is cloudy and that there is more sediment and small rocks along the riverbed than usual. When you walk further down the creek, you notice a few fish floating by the bank. Feeling increasingly concerned, you look around to see if there are any other hikers along the path to consult with or for an information kiosk to see if there is a nearby environmental center, but find neither. <strong>Would you know what to do?</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PennFuture has a brand new resource to help you know what to do. The <a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/FINAL-BE-A-WATERSHED-WATCHDOG-PDF.PDF""><strong>&ldquo;Be a Watershed Watchdog&rdquo; pocket guide</strong></a> is a portable, waterproof wallet-sized guide that helps you to identify pollution in your waterways and directs you on what you can do.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Pennsylvania has more than 86,000 miles of streams and rivers in the state, 19,900 of which are listed as impaired in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s (PA DEP) <a href=""http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/CleanWater/WaterQuality/Integrated%20Water%20Quality%20Report-2016/Pages/default.aspx""><strong>2016 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report.</strong></a> With the United States Environmental Protection Agencies&rsquo; efforts to <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-Statement-Trump-Rescinds-Clean-Water-Rule""><strong>repeal the Clean Water Rule</strong></a> and the PA DEP <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/News-State-Spending-Bill-Poses-Threat-to-Environment-Conservation-and-Public-Health""><strong>lacking the capacity and funding</strong></a> to adequately monitor water quality standards, we need all hands on deck to support and protect our waterways.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The &ldquo;Be a Watershed Watchdog&rdquo; pocket guide is the perfect tool for outdoor enthusiasts, sportsmen, students, citizen scientists, and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nature lovers. We all have a shared responsibility to be stewards for our environment, and knowing what to do and who to contact upon discovering pollution or an illegal discharge in a local creek or waterway is a critical first step.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The guide identifies six easily identifiable signs of potential pollution to look for:&nbsp;</div>

<ul>
	<li>Water discoloration,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Unusual odors,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Dumping,</li>
	<li>Fish kills, and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Algal blooms.</li>
</ul>

<div>If you see one or more of these signs of potential pollution, you should take photos and/or videos, look for a potential source of the pollution, record your location, the time(s) of discovery, and your observations. These details can then be reported to the PA DEP, your <a href=""https://pacd.org/?page_id=59""><strong>County Conservation District</strong></a>, and to PennFuture.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Our waterways are the common property of all Pennsylvanians. Together, we can help to stop pollution as we see it and protect our waterways for the benefit of our communities and generations to come.&nbsp;</div>

Meet the Donor: Carl Balis,8/28/2017,"<p>Carl Balis, longtime supporter of PennFuture, was actually born in Japan while his father was stationed overseas. But he said he has no real memory of his time in that country, since his parents moved back to Philadelphia and Germantown while he was still an infant. These days, Carl calls Delaware County his home, and says that in his heart, he knows he fully became aware of environmental issues as soon as he could really look around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;If your eyes are open, it does kind of hit you in the face,&rdquo; he said. As world events and local issues affecting the environment kept rising to the forefront, Carl also noticed that there were huge changes to the beautiful open spaces near his hometown in Delaware County. &nbsp;So much of what he remembered as a young person was gone, swept up by developers. As he got older, he felt there was constant destruction and construction with no thought for the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when he asked himself what he could do to make a difference. &nbsp;Carl realized that funding is a big factor to preserving land, and that&#39;s when he decided to start contributing to a variety of environmental groups, including PennFuture. Carl chose to donate to PennFuture because of the organization&rsquo;s local angle. He believes that the entire environmental movement is made up of a series of little accomplishments and victories, and he thought about how he could make a bigger impact locally. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Here in Pennsylvania, he has a personal stake in the issues, and he can affect change by supporting PennFuture. &ldquo;I wanted to take care of environmental issues in my own backyard where you can really put your hands on things, including calling local representatives and going to meetings,&rdquo; Carl said.</p>

<p>He was delighted to hear about PennFuture&#39;s alliance with the Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, because that will have more of an impact on our work to protect public health and the environment. When I asked him what he would say to people to encourage them to support protecting the environment, he was very clear. &quot;You live in it. &nbsp;The people you love live in it. &nbsp;You are in it from the day you are born. &nbsp;If the environment goes down, you go down with it. &nbsp;It is your home. You need to get involved, contribute funds and vote! &nbsp;You can make a difference,&rdquo; Carl said.</p>

<p>He is very concerned with the loss of open spaces in our state. He asked, &quot;Why would you put poison in the water and air and annihilate the beautiful open spaces with development?&rdquo; He&#39;s not against development, but feels there has to be better planning when encroaching on public lands. &quot;Once they begin developing, they don&#39;t spare anything until every square inch is taken. That is what happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carl also said he is disgusted by the Pennsylvania legislators&#39; inability to implement a true extraction tax for our state. He feels that tax is something people can relate to -- but by not getting this tax passed, &ldquo;the legislature is effectively letting big companies pay less, so we, the taxpayers, pay more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lastly, he is looking forward to attending our <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/91417environmentalrightsamendmentforum/index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=bb401717-4b11-495d-95cb-b5c040754d73""><strong>Environmental Rights Amendment Forum on Sept. 14</strong></a>, particularly because the recent June decision by the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court finally puts &quot;some teeth&quot; to the state constitutional provision. &nbsp;</p>

Experience the Aquaponics Project at Pittsburgh Solar Tour,8/28/2017,"<p><em>The Aquaponics Farm is a stop on PennFuture&#39;s upcoming Pittsburgh Solar Tour, which will be held Saturday, Oct. 14. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2017solartour/index.html"">Click here for more information and we look forward to seeing you there!</a></em></p>

<p>Aquaponics is a sustainable agricultural practice built upon naturally occurring relationships. This system relies on the built-in checks and balances within ecosystems, allowing for optimal production while maintaining suitable living conditions for the entire ecological community.&nbsp;Aquaponics harnesses these incredibly powerful biological processes and marries them to cutting edge technology to create a controlled, profitable, and entirely sustainable system of food production.</p>

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>

<p>Two years ago, a small group of students from the University of Pittsburgh, myself included, formed The Aquaponics Project. <strong>Our objective was to build Pittsburgh&rsquo;s first portable aquaponics farm.</strong> We recognized Pittsburgh&rsquo;s status as a food desert, defined by a shortage of supermarkets and other stores that carry affordable healthful food, as well as many issues with traditional farming practices. We were able to find a solution to both problems in aquaponics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aquaponics allows us to grow plants and fish within the same system and capitalize on the symbiotic relationship between the two. The plants are grown in water alone; all nutrients the plants require are provided by the fish waste and, in turn, the plant roots purify the water, creating a healthy aquatic environment. It is a closed loop system in which every bit of energy is conserved and put to use. The only input is fish food, and the output is a lofty 600 pounds of vitamin-rich greens and protein packed fish per month with no waste, no pollutants, and no large footprint on the community.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>With this practice, soil is unnecessary, allowing for a more efficient use of space. This can save acres of forests, meadows, and wetlands from destruction for the purpose of being converted into farmland.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Our team was able to come up with a design which recycles old shipping containers and uses them as the base for our greenhouses. The bottom level contains a 300 gallon tank of fish and the top holds about 35 vertical grow towers capable of producing 700 plants. The entire container only takes up 20&rsquo; x 8&rsquo;, allowing it to be placed in practically any community in need of fresh produce without creating a disturbance to the land or property values. It is also compact enough to be moved from location to location as an educational tool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our greenhouse has already made an appearance in Downtown Pittsburgh by the Gateway T Station and Manchester Park in the North Side. Next, we will be partnering with Repair the World and 412 Food Rescue to tackle food insecurity issues&nbsp;in East Liberty.</p>

<p><strong>Embracing Modern Technology</strong></p>

<p>Every technological advancement we make to our design is meant to optimize yield, efficiency, and ease of use. Yet, increasing productivity does not have to mean increasing one&rsquo;s carbon footprint. In order to optimize our production, we have put into place a number of monitoring systems to collect data on PH levels, temperature, and growth. Additionally, as with all decisions we make regarding this project, we draw inspiration from natural processes. In order to support our electrical needs, we installed solar panels on the roof of our structure. We simply took note of what the plants in our greenhouse had been doing since the beginning of life itself; converting light waves into energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sun is an inexhaustible source of energy that has been largely untapped. With the invention of photovoltaic cells and the recent decrease in production cost, harnessing the power of the sun has never been more accessible. Along with promoting healthy food choices, buying local, and eliminating food waste, The Aquaponics Project is proud to support the solar movement in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If you have yet to take a tour of our facility, we are excited to be a stop on&nbsp;PennFuture&rsquo;s Solar Tour this Oct.&nbsp;14, so drop by! We would be happy to show you around and discuss the unlimited potential of solar power within homes, businesses, and even the odd farm.</strong> <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/2017solartour/index.html""><strong>Click here to register today.</strong></a></p>

How the Environmental Rights Amendment Strengthens Our Impact,8/22/2017,"<p><em>This is part one in a blog series about how the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in PEDF cemented Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s vision of the Environmental Rights Amendment in Robinson Township.&nbsp;Join us in Philadelphia on Sept. 14 for the <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/91417environmentalrightsamendmentforum/index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=bb401717-4b11-495d-95cb-b5c040754d73"">Environmental Rights Amendment Forum</a> to listen to key litigators from the cases mentioned throughout this piece, and to learn more about how it impacts the air you breathe and the water you drink. <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/91417environmentalrightsamendmentforum/index.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=bb401717-4b11-495d-95cb-b5c040754d73"">Click here to register for this free event today.</a></em></p>

<p>PennFuture members have inquired why the state Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in Robinson Township v. Commonwealth did not result in an immediate change in how state and local governments make decisions.&nbsp;When issued, the Robinson case seemed to breathe new life into Article I, Section 27 of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Constitution (the Environmental Rights Amendment or ERA). Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion, in particular, was widely quoted and frequently praised by those in the conservation community, but it seemed to be largely ignored by lower courts and government agencies.</p>

<p><strong>To understand the reason for the differing responses, this blog explains the concept of &ldquo;legal precedent&rdquo; and how it took four years and another Supreme Court decision to transform Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion from a learned treatise into binding Pennsylvania law.</strong></p>

<p>In 2013, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in Robinson provided hope that, for the first time since the ERA&rsquo;s ratification in 1971, the judiciary would play a critical role in ensuring protection of citizens&rsquo; environmental rights. Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion, which exhaustively reviewed the history of environmental degradation that led to the adoption of the ERA, sought to establish a framework that recognized the fundamental nature of citizens&rsquo; environmental rights, and imposed conservation obligations on the government&rsquo;s management of public natural resources. The opinion seemed to many a siren&rsquo;s song for vigorous protection of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s natural resources. But that did not turn out to be the case - at least not immediately.</p>

<p>Legal precedent is a fundamental principle of the American legal system. It means that a ruling in a particular case, under certain circumstances, controls a subsequent decision in another case involving similar facts and issues. One of the circumstances is that a majority of the judges of the court agree on the rationale for deciding the case. If that happens, that majority decision controls how subsequent cases with similar facts and issues are decided, thus increasing its impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some cases, however, a majority of the court agrees on the outcome of the case, but not on the reason for the decision. When that happens, those in the majority will write multiple opinions explaining their decision. The opinion that gets the most judges, but short of a majority, is referred to as the plurality opinion.&nbsp;Unlike majority opinions, plurality opinions are not binding on subsequent courts.</p>

<p>Such was the case with the Robinson decision. Four of seven justices voted to overturn parts of the Oil and Gas Act, but only three justices agreed that the provisions should be overturned because they violated the ERA. The fourth justice in the majority agreed that the provisions were unconstitutional, but he preferred to rely on a constitutional principle known as substantive due process. Because Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion was issued on behalf of three of seven justices, the opinion did not result in &ldquo;precedent&rdquo; that required future courts to interpret the ERA in the same manner.</p>

<p><strong>More than 40 years before Robinson, the Commonwealth Court, in a case known as Payne v. Kassab, explained how it would decide whether a government action violated citizens&rsquo; rights under the ERA.&nbsp;</strong>The court held that a court could not overturn a government action unless it determined that the action violated a statute or regulation, failed to incorporate reasonable efforts to reduce environmental harm, or caused environmental harm that clearly outweighed the benefits of the action. <strong>This three-part test, known as the Payne test, was exceedingly deferential to the legislative and executive branches of government. </strong>Unless the government acted in some patently egregious manner, courts would not find that citizens&rsquo; rights under the ERA had been violated. Not surprisingly, in more than 40 years since the adoption of the Payne test, Pennsylvania courts had not struck down a single government action as violating the ERA. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion in Robinson excoriated the Payne test, declaring that it was made from whole cloth and did not adequately protect citizens&#39; fundamental constitutional rights. Chief Justice Castille favored an approach that featured courts more prominently in protecting citizens&rsquo; environmental rights, just as if they were being asked to protect other fundamental rights such as the right to vote, or free speech. The courts, Chief Justice Castille said, should focus their evaluation on the reason for the government action and the extent to which citizens&rsquo; rights to &ldquo;clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment&rdquo; have been impaired.</p>

<p><strong>Following Robinson, PennFuture and other organizations argued in a variety of cases that, because of its sheer persuasiveness, courts should adopt the reasoning in Robinson. </strong>Our opponents, however, argued that Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s opinion was not binding on the courts, which should reject Robinson in favor of continuing to use the Payne test. The lower courts, as well as government agencies - sided with our opponents - no matter how sound the reasoning, Robinson&rsquo;s plurality opinion was not binding in subsequent cases. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/News-State-Supreme-Court-Rules-Leasing-Public-Land-for-Fracking-Betrayed-Governments-Constitutional-Duties""><strong>All of that changed on June 20, 2017, when the state Supreme Court issued its decision in Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Fund v. Commonwealth.</strong></a> The Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Fund (PEDF), a nonprofit organization, challenged the constitutionality of a series of state laws that changed how revenue from the lease of oil and gas rights on public lands was being used. The revenue had previously been used solely to support conservation efforts associated with the public lands. The legislation changed that by transferring those funds to the general fund, where it would be used to support a wide variety of public purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ERA provides that the Commonwealth holds our public natural resources in trust for the benefit of all people, including future generations.&nbsp;PEDF argued that any revenue derived from the disposition of those public natural resources must remain a part of the trust and be used to further the purposes of the trust. <strong>The Supreme Court agreed, holding that funds derived from the lease of oil and gas rights on public lands must remain a part of the trust and be used to further the public&rsquo;s right to &ldquo;clean air, pure water and the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.&rdquo;</strong> The state, the Court said, does not own our public natural resources as a proprietor, but instead manages them as would a bank that manages funds in a trust.</p>

<p><strong>The Court&rsquo;s decision was monumental, but equally so was the Court&rsquo;s rationale.</strong> Unlike Robinson, a clear majority agreed that the laws violated the ERA.&nbsp;In making that decision, the Court squarely rejected the continued use of the Payne test, and just as squarely adopted, instead, the rationale described by Chief Justice Castille in Robinson.</p>

<p>Justice Baer acknowledged the change in direction embarked on by the Court: &ldquo;Through today&rsquo;s decision, this Court takes several monumental steps in the development of the Environmental Rights Amendment &hellip; [including] dismantling of the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s Payne test &hellip; [and] solidify[ing] the jurisprudential sea-change begun by Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s plurality in Robinson Township v. Commonwealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>So it came to be that, four years after Robinson, the state Supreme Court converted Chief Justice Castille&rsquo;s plurality opinion from an eloquent essay on the meaning of the ERA into binding legal precedent in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</strong></p>

Farmers & Clean Water Need State Lawmaker Leadership on Funding Priorities,8/17/2017,"<p><em><strong>This blog post is <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-We-Are-All-the-Watershed-Ag-Days-in-Happy-Valley"">one in a series</a> from Ag Progress Days, an event&nbsp;hosted by Penn State University&rsquo;s College of Agriculture Sciences.</strong></em></p>

<p>Wednesday at Penn State&rsquo;s Ag Progress Days brought state and federal policymakers to Centre County. The show&rsquo;s site was busy with farmers and members of the agriculture and conservation communities, but public officials and legislators hustled and bustled around the grounds to check out the displays and taste the food.</p>

<p>The morning held an informational meeting for a joint group of Pennsylvania House and Senate Agriculture &amp; Rural Affairs committee members to talk about the recent updates on the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Phase III of the Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). Present were Chairman Sen. Elder Vogel, House Chairman Martin Causer, House Minority Chairman Eddie Day Pashinski, Rep. Sid Kavulich, Rep. Pam DeLissio, Rep. Stephen Bloom, Rep. David Millard, Rep. David Zimmerman, Rep. Russ Diamond, Rep. Dan Moul, Rep. John Lawrence, Rep. Rich Irvin, Rep. Mark Keller, Rep. Mike Tobash, and Sen. Sharif Street. The participation of the committees at Ag Progress Days speaks to the importance of understanding water quality concerns in Pennsylvania and making real changes with solutions that may be difficult.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The committees heard from Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Patrick McDonnell and Department of Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding on the current status of the Watershed Implementation Plan for the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Secretary McDonnell shared that to date, 12 percent of all Pennsylvania farmland has been inspected by the DEP or partners and staff members in the state&rsquo;s Conservation Districts (280 total; assessing almost 246,000 acres), which the Wolf administration has touted as being a very successful first year of agricultural inspections for nutrient management and erosion and soil plans on hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One great statistic to hear from Secretary McDonnell is that 60 percent of all Pennsylvania farms have plans in place, but more work is needed in this regard. To address the remaining 40 percent of farms, McDonnell and Redding asked the legislators for help to figure out a good way to collaborate and provide support to farmers. <strong>Here, more funding for technical assistance to farmers at the state level is critical and more incentives for developing and implementing management plans would go a long way.</strong></p>

<p>Highlighted during the hearing was the fact that Pennsylvania has its own unique challenges to overcome, but the state is required to meet&nbsp;water quality goals not only due to the federal government&rsquo;s Total Maximum Daily Load &ndash; a pollution diet &ndash; the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, and the Environmental Rights Amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution, but because Pennsylvanians believe in the right to clean water. Pennsylvanians deserve all streams, creeks, and rivers to be swimmable and fishable once again. Making real changes and investments by the state and federal governments would make significant progress in meeting our water quality goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of the hearing, Pennsylvania is responsible for 69 percent of the remaining basin-wide nitrogen load reduction that is needed by 2025, and more than 80 percent of this is because of agricultural run-off, our state&rsquo;s largest non-point source pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The state&rsquo;s agency officials did bring some good news, however; the water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and our local waterways are largely getting better. This is happening as a direct result of farmers, conservationists, environmental professionals, and governments at every level coming together to brainstorm and put solutions in place.</p>

<p>The past year was successful in that the Penn State University College of Agricultural Sciences executed a farm conservation survey that showed farmers are doing a great deal of best management practice work on their own dime, but it is more evident that the state needs to step up. Our conservation districts are doing great work at relying on their relationships with farmers to collect data and empower farmers to be good stewards with help, and the DEP Chesapeake Bay office noted recent successes, such as setting up an urban stormwater cost-share program, agricultural best management practice special projects, an established WIP Steering Committee, and a road map for execution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secretary McDonnell stressed the importance of taking state and federal dollars and spending on conservation practices in specific, targeted watersheds which could use the most help. Secretary Redding made a great point to the legislators at Ag Progress Days by noting though the state receives funding from the federal Farm Bill and the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program, there is a very real gap in funding for agriculture best management practice implementation. <strong>Much more money is needed from public private partnership involvement, but primarily more money needs to be invested by the state government.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Following the legislative meeting at the College of Agricultural Sciences building, state legislators and the agency heads joined Governor Tom Wolf for remarks at the College&rsquo;s Ag Government and Industry luncheon. Congressman Glenn &ldquo;GT&rdquo; Thompson and Congressman Dwight Evans also took part in the lunch, and later spoke at a town hall discussion on agriculture issues from Pennsylvania stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Governor Wolf reminded attendees that, &ldquo;Clean water is a problem for everyone in this state,&rdquo; not just for the agriculture sector, or for those in certain parts of the state. Wolf nudged his colleagues in the legislature in a friendly manner to finish the state budget and make sure that there is more money for clean water and fixing this crisis in the Commonwealth. Wolf went on to say that he wants to make sure that Pennsylvania is a place for agriculture to thrive and wants to make sure that the state government is not standing in the way&hellip;especially because it may be lacking financial resources to help, which is now a recurring, and unacceptable, theme in the Keystone State.</p>

<p>Secretary Redding and Secretary McDonnell were adamant in their take that the goals should be coequal and not competing. We need to do whatever we can in Pennsylvania to advocate for viable farms and champion clean water at the same time. We don&rsquo;t have to choose, but our state needs leadership and dedicated funding for our water resources to make this happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>State legislators, you&rsquo;re up to bat.</strong></p>

<p>As was mentioned again during the hearing today, we all contribute to our state&rsquo;s waterway impairment problems, so we can &ndash; and must &ndash; all be part of the solution.</p>

We Are All the Watershed: Ag Progress Days in Happy Valley,8/16/2017,"<p>The annual <a href=""http://agsci.psu.edu/apd"">Ag Progress Days</a>, hosted by Penn State University&rsquo;s College of Agriculture Sciences, kicked off Tuesday morning in Furnace, Pa. Each year, the college and hundreds of partners, including nongovernmental organizations, governments, and businesses, join together to discuss, demonstrate, and display advances in agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s events highlight the growing importance of water quality and conservation efforts needed in the agriculture sector. Much has been done to advance sustainability in recent years by farmers, but more work is ahead.</p>

<p><strong>As I serve as PennFuture&rsquo;s Campaign Manager for Watershed Advocacy, I am spending this week at Ag Days learning from farmers and agriculture professionals, as well as talking to partners and educating participants about the essential connection between environmental stewardship in farming and clean water.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Pennsylvania boasts more than 85,000 miles of rivers and streams. These streams flow through farms, backyards, cities, and towns. No matter where we live, we each play a unique and essential role to protect our water. The exhibits, lectures, and events&nbsp;this year are educating attendees about riparian buffers on farmland, linking land preservation to water quality goals, and implementing best management practices, including no-till farming, streambank fencing, and tree plantings.</p>

<p><strong>The theme that has resonated with me throughout the day, from driving through the mountains of Huntingdon County, over the Juniata River, and alongside the famous and pristine Spruce Creek in Centre County, is the idea of connecting the land ethic of farmers to a culture of stewardship for our streams, creeks, and rivers.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I began the day with a session on using drones for agriculture and conservation practices, and participated in a town hall meeting with the PA Department of Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding on the high priority issues facing Pennsylvania agriculture and water quality. As the day unfolded, I heard from head Penn State University researchers who developed and executed the recent PA Farm Conservation Survey, learned about using live stakes for stream restoration, trees for trout, and creating community partnerships to make a difference.</p>

<p>Today, the Pennsylvania State House Agriculture Committee will discuss the latest on clean water goals as part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed clean up efforts, and Governor Tom Wolf will host a luncheon to discuss agriculture and conservation in the Commonwealth.&nbsp;Congressman Glenn &lsquo;GT&rsquo; Thompson (PA-5, R) will host a&quot;Barnyard Discussion,&quot;&nbsp;to hear directly from stakeholders from various sectors of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s agriculture.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about this show each year is the fact that people come together in partnership with environmental conservation groups, agriculture trade associations, alliances, and coalitions across the gamut of school of thought and background. Local, state, and federal government representatives also come together to talk about the state of agriculture, farming life, and conservation in Pennsylvania. And we are all working together for solutions.</p>

<p>I was reminded repeatedly through the visits to the seed and machinery companies, the farmers asking the tough questions about the best cover crops for clean water, and the college students presenting on livestock and baling hay:<strong> we all make up the watershed.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Each one of us is a member of a specific watershed with a home and a real effect on our streams. While working to restore and protect our public natural resources may seem like a daunting challenge with many complexities, we can each do our part by supporting our local farmers, planting trees, participating in stream clean-ups, joining watershed associations, and reminding our state and national legislators the importance of standing up for our water.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Through collective action and public participation, we can all make a difference. We are all the watershed.&nbsp;</p>

From Despair to Determination: An Inconvenient Sequel,8/15/2017,"<p>As I made my way to the movie theater for a free screening of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huX1bmfdkyA"">An Inconvenient Sequel</a>, Al Gore&rsquo;s follow-up documentary to the game-changing original, I braced myself.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it. Environmental advocacy work in the last six months has felt a lot like an emotional rollercoaster, one in which the Trump administration has attacked almost every aspect of in terms of our rights to clean air, pure water and a healthy climate. The situation at the state level looks just as bleak at times, with the power of oil and gas at the forefront of the state budget battle. I needed some kind of a mental boost, and wasn&rsquo;t sure what this documentary had in store for me.</p>

<p>The free Friday night screening, generously provided by The Heinz Endowments and Climate Reality, pleasantly surprised me in the way it inspired hope, despite the significant challenges ahead.</p>

<p>The film walks viewers through current scientific facts surrounding the threat of extreme weather, sea level rise, the impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable people, and Gore&rsquo;s personal road to his current position as global climate change leader. There are incredible scenes featuring leaders from both sides of the aisle who see the issue of climate change as an opportunity to invest in clean energy, proving that working in a united way is possible if we just take the time to be open. The film is also as much about never giving up as it is about the climate crisis, and I appreciated Gore&rsquo;s personal reflections on the fact that oftentimes, the plans we have for life are not exactly what life has planned for us.</p>

<p>I felt personally connected to the film as Gore said outright that he knows many environmental advocates grapple with despair and moving forward on an almost daily basis. Sometimes, the uphill battle to protect our environment seems like one that will never reach the top of the mountain. But in the end, the film highlighted the undeniable progress that has been made in terms of clean energy, and it lifted my spirits and motivated me more than ever.</p>

<p>What I walked away with as I left the movie theater was so much more powerful than the despair I had initially expected. I walked away with the knowledge and the belief that this movement &ndash; our movement working towards a clean energy future &ndash; is so much larger than President Donald Trump. While we are certainly up against the powerful interests of dark money and a democracy crippled by the oil and gas industry &ndash; one man simply cannot stop a world of people working for change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Trump can deny climate change all he wants, but as I watched the tireless, thankless policy work that went into the formation of the Paris Climate Agreement, watched hundreds of leaders buckling down to find shared solutions, to find a healthier future that the world can see collectively as one, I realized: it&rsquo;s not up to President Trump to stop us.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s up to us to keep going.</strong></p>

<p>Our work matters. Your work matters. Whether it&rsquo;s at the borough level, the city level, or the state level, it is up to each one of us to make individual choices that move towards a clean energy future. No step is too small, and together, we can continue our momentum and progress.</p>

Protecting Lake Erie and Reforming the Renewable Fuel Standard,8/8/2017,"<p>Forty-five years ago, Lake Erie was so polluted that TIME Magazine stated it was, &ldquo;in danger of dying by suffocation.&rdquo; Although there was a massive clean-up effort on the local, state, and federal level, Lake Erie once again experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in recorded history in 2011, with a peak intensity over three times greater than any previously observed bloom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where are these algal blooms coming from? Although there are many causes, increased corn production in recent years is an important factor. Corn is one of the most chemical dependent crops. It loves phosphate fertilizers, and so does algae. When it rains, the water that runs off of corn fields can be loaded with extremely high volumes of phosphorous nutrients. When this pollution lands in the shallow western basin of Lake Erie, it promotes rapid and massive growth of unhealthy, even toxic green slime.</p>

<p>In 2014, the city of Toledo, Ohio suffered a drinking water shortage affecting half a million residents for three days, thanks to yet another toxic algal bloom in Lake Erie. This event was even worse than the 2011 occurrence. Recorded algae levels were 1,000 times higher than levels deemed safe for drinking water by the World Health Organization. The disaster closed down beaches, which had dramatic effects on fishing, tourism, and recreation industries, all while killing and pushing marine life out of its way.</p>

<p>As someone who grew up in Erie, this deeply concerns me because so much of my life has revolved around the lake and its tributaries. When I was young, my grandfather taught me how to fish at the mouth of 4-mile creek. I probably earned most of my Boy Scout Merit Badges at Presque Isle, and of course, I&rsquo;ll never forget that perfect first date as we went to the top of the Bicentennial Tower at the Dock and watched the sun set over the bay. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I also remember observing just how fragile our ecosystem was when transoceanic ships introduced zebra mussels to the lake in the early 90&rsquo;s. Just like algal blooms, this invasive species had a swift and devastating effect on the lake and all of us who lived near it. As a young person, I took all of these things for granted, but now I worry that my grandchildren won&rsquo;t have the luxury of making these same&nbsp;types of memories. We&rsquo;re all connected to the lake in one way or another, and I believe that it is our duty to preserve it for generations to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Renewable Fuel Standard was a federal mandate passed into law in 2005 to blend renewable fuels into conventional gasoline. The authors of the law meant to drive innovation and development of truly renewable cellulosic fuels, but have instead driven more and more conversion of natural areas to corn fields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the law was passed with good intentions, it has resulted in a major transformation of the landscape with devastating effects, including degrading the water quality of the Great Lakes with corn-fertilizer driven algal blooms. This occurs as a result of agricultural runoff during storms.</p>

<p>We must reform the Renewable Fuel Standard so it gives farmers more choices to manage agricultural runoff and so that it promotes biofuels made from sources other than corn to protect our Great Lakes that we cherish and call home.&nbsp;</p>

Moratorium on Fracking in the Delaware River Basin is Critical to Protect Our Water,8/7/2017,"<div>The Delaware River is the longest un-dammed river east of the Mississippi. &nbsp;Over 15 million people across four states - Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware - rely on the river for a variety of consumptive and non-consumptive uses, including for drinking water, agricultural, recreational, and industrial uses. &nbsp;In Pennsylvania, this great water resource brings millions of dollars in recreation and tourism.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>And yet, there is controversy in Pennsylvania over whether to open up this critical Basin to natural gas development, in particular the unconventional horizontal, high-volume hydraulic fracturing method, commonly known as &ldquo;fracking&rdquo;. &nbsp;So far, the interstate commission that oversees the use and protection of the Delaware River resources &ndash; the Delaware River Basin Commission (&ldquo;DRBC&rdquo;) &ndash; has not allowed fracking in the basin, citing the known short- and long-term risks and lack of proven protections of water resources. &nbsp;But the pressure has been mounting on the DRBC to allow natural gas extraction in the Basin. &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PennFuture supports the current moratorium on fracking in the Delaware River Basin, is advocating for a permanent ban on natural gas extraction in the Basin, and has partnered with Conservation Voters of PA and others to get thousands to sign onto a petition asking DRBC to permanently ban unconventional natural resource extraction in the Basin. &nbsp;PennFuture will resist any proposal that threatens this great water resource in Pennsylvania.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>The Delaware River Basin Commission</strong></div>

<div>Established in 1961, the Delaware River Basin Commission created a federal Compact between the four Basin states and the federal government with the purpose of managing and restoring water quality to the Delaware River. &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Before the DRBC was created, the Delaware River was largely considered to be an open sewer. &nbsp;The water was so polluted that it peeled paint from ships, made people ill just from the smell, and, in parts, could not sustain fish and other aquatic life. But now, the Delaware is hailed as one of the world&rsquo;s top water quality restoration success stories, and its improved water quality has allowed river-based recreation to become one of the major economic drivers for the four-state area. This success was made possible by the DRBC, which allows for a unified approach to managing a river system without regard to political boundaries.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>How the DRBC Protects the Basin Resources: the Compact</strong></div>

<div>The Compact charges the Basin states with developing and adopting water resource programs. &nbsp;Commission programs include water quality protection, water supply allocation, regulatory review, water conservation initiatives, watershed planning, drought management, flood loss reduction, education/outreach, and recreation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>One of the more critical programs, designed to &ldquo;keep the clean water clean,&rdquo; is the Special Protection Waters program, which prevents degradation in streams and rivers considered to have exceptionally high scenic, recreational, ecological, and/or water supply values through stricter control of wastewater discharges and reporting requirements.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In addition to developing water resource programs, the DRBC has the authority to regulate certain activities in the Basin in order to protect and restore the water quality of the Delaware. &nbsp;According to Section 3 of the Compact, the DRBC must review and approve applications for any projects that may have a substantial effect on the Basin&rsquo;s water resources, and approval may only be given when the Commissioners find and determine that the project would not substantially impair the water resources. &nbsp;Specifically, in recognizing the importance of protecting high quality waters &ndash; such as Special Protection Waters &ndash; the DRBC has the discretion to require project sponsors to obtain DRBC approval even where those projects may not meet other review and approval thresholds.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>The Substantial Risks to Basin Resources from Gas Drilling</strong><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span></div>

<div>Pennsylvania is no stranger to natural resource extraction. &nbsp;But high pressure hydraulic fracturing used to produce natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations poses substantial risks to fresh water resources. &nbsp;The process uses several million gallons of water, sand and chemical additives, under immense pressure, to release natural gas from deep inside the earth. &nbsp;Estimates vary, but about ten percent of this chemical mixture returns to the surface as what the industry refers to as &ldquo;flowback water.&rdquo; The fluids are high in dissolved solids and may contain sand, heavy metals, oil, grease, man-made organic chemicals and radioactive elements. This fluid would cause serious pollution if discharged into Pennsylvania waters without treatment. This means that millions of gallons of contaminated water must be stored and eventually transported off-site across Pennsylvania for treatment or disposal. &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>The DRBC has identified three significant areas of concern regarding fracking in the Basin:&nbsp;</strong></div>

<ul>
	<li>Withdrawals of groundwater and surface water for drilling projects in the Marcellus Shale may reduce the volume of water available for other purposes, such as drinking water supply, aquatic life, and recreation;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Drilling operations may result in additional discharge of pollutants into groundwater; and</li>
	<li>The flowback water requires disposal and treatment which has the potential to pollute Delaware River Basin waters.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div>While running for office, Tom Wolf, the current Governor of Pennsylvania and one of the five Commissioners, made it a campaign promise to continue supporting a moratorium on fracking in the Delaware River Basin, and recently reiterated his position that gas production should not take place in the Basin.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thus, it&rsquo;s no wonder the DRBC has been hesitant to allow fracking to occur within the Basin.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Current Status of Fracking in the Basin: The &ldquo;De Facto&rdquo; Moratorium</strong></div>

<div>In response to the noticable increase in the number of active and planned natural gas extracion projects within the Delaware River Basin, between 2009 and 2010, the Executive Director of DRBC issued several formal determinations that set the stage for the current moratorium on natural gas development in the Basin. &nbsp;Citing the potential significant environmental and water quality impacts, these decisions prohibited any natural gas extraction project (including associated infrastructure and exploratory wells) from occuring in the Basin within the drainage area of Special Protection Waters wihtout first applying for and obtaining DRBC approval. &nbsp;The determination also stated that DRBC would be promulgating regulations pertaining to natural gas development projects in the Basin.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In 2010, the DRBC issued draft Water Quality Regulations (Article 7) to protect the water resources of the Delaware River Basin during the construction and operation of natural gas development projects. &nbsp;The draft regulations apply broadly to all &ldquo;natural gas development projects,&rdquo; including the construction and operation of all natural gas wells in the Basin, regardless of the target geologic formation, whether a well is for production or exploration, or whether high-volume or low-volume hydraulic fracturing is contemplated. The DRBC received approximately 69,000 public comments on the draft regulations. Despite revisions in 2011, the Commissioners declined to take a final vote on adoption of the draft regulations, citing the need for more information on the potential harmful environmental impacts. &nbsp;This delay has resulted in the current &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; moratorium on gas development in the Basin.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Court Ruled: DRBC Has Authority to Regulate Fracking</strong></div>

<div>In May 2016, a group of mineral rights owners sued the DRBC in federal district court in Pennsylvania, challenging the Commission&rsquo;s authority to regulate gas development in the Basin. &nbsp;In a decision issued this March, the federal court concluded that the DRBC has the authority to regulate natural gas extraction activities, including well pads and related drilling, fracturing, and operation of natural gas wells under the Compact. Wayne Land and Mineral Group, LLC v. DRBC (M.D. Pa, Mar. 23, 2017) WLMG filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on April 7, 2017. The Court of Appeals has not yet issued its decision.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Under the District Court&rsquo;s ruling, WLMG, and any other person seeking to undertake natural gas development projects in the Basin, must obtain the DRBC&rsquo;s approval before undertaking those activities. &nbsp;And the DRBC has indicated that it will not consider or approve any natural gas extraction projects in the Basin without final regulations.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>

<div>The DRBC has identified specific and serious concerns about the risk of harm posed by unconventional natural gas development in the Basin, and has held off on allowing such risky extraction unless and until it can ensure the protection of the water resources of Basin.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Considering the precious nature of the Basin&rsquo;s resources, and the possible long-term impact that natural gas development can have on water resources, PennFuture is calling on the DRBC to issue a permanent ban on fracking in the Basin. &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We can&#39;t afford the risk of serious environmental harm that may result from wide-spread natural gas development in the Basin. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s taken the DRBC over half a century to bring the Delaware River back from the brink of collapse, and now is not the time to jeopardize those efforts.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Improve Your Community’s Stormwater Pollution Problem,8/3/2017,"<div>Pennsylvania has a great opportunity to improve water quality by reducing pollution in the coming years through the Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s new Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>MS4 communities operate separate storm sewer systems, which includes storm drains that take in rain water from streets, leading it directly to local waterways.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Those MS4 communities that release stormwater into polluted waterbodies in their areas, as well as those located in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, are required to submit Pollutant Reduction Plans (PRP) or a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Plan to address the steps they will take to reduce water pollution over the next five years.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Municipalities must submit these PRP and TMDL plans in addition to their permit applications to PA DEP by September 16, 2017 following a 45-day public participation period. These plans detail the steps municipalities will follow to reduce known water pollutants, including sediment and phosphorus in the coming years.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In addition to the plans, municipalities are required to follow best management practices and document their progress under six minimum control measures, including:&nbsp;</div>

<ul>
	<li>Public education and outreach&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Public participation and involvement</li>
	<li>Illicit discharge detection and elimination</li>
	<li>Stormwater runoff control at construction sites</li>
	<li>Post-construction stormwater management</li>
	<li>Pollution prevention and good housekeeping</li>
</ul>

<div>Many of these municipalities have already made their plans available for public comment in order to meet the September deadline. Watershed community members, advocates, and experts have the chance to help shape the effectiveness of these plans by writing and submitting comments to their municipalities&rsquo; PRP and TMDL plans.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Luckily, there are resources available to assist those reviewing and commenting on these plans. <strong>Here are a few resources created by PennFuture and the Pennsylvania Campaign for Clean Water Stormwater Workgroup to help individuals, groups, and organizations to write and submit comments on these plans:</strong></div>

Take Action: Stop Trump's Repeal of Clean Water Rule,8/1/2017,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency has opened a public comment period to consider repealing the Clean Water Rule. If repealed by the federal government, the rivers, streams, and wetlands that provide Pennsylvanians with safe drinking water, outdoor recreation activities, and water-based tourism will be at risk.</p>

<p>Marking yet another assault on the environment by President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration, we need your help in letting our leaders know that clean water is a right that all people share.</p>

<p>The Clean Water Rule protects those small streams and wetlands that nearly 8 million Pennsylvanians rely on for safe drinking water. It also protects nearly 11,000 miles of creeks and streams across the state, which contributes more than $4 billion to our economy through outdoor recreation, breweries, and other sources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, this regulatory roll-back would adversely impact Pennsylvanians. 63% of Pennsylvanians get their drinking water from sources that rely on small streams that are protected by the Clean Water Rule. With this Rule, protections were restored to 10,720 miles of streams that feed into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s drinking water sources and thousands of acres of wetlands that provide flood protection, recharge groundwater supplies, filter pollution, and provide essential wildlife habitat are safeguarded.</p>

<p>Americans want the Clean Water Rule. During its 200 day public comment period, over 800,000 Americans submitted positive comments and recent research from the League of Conservation Voters shows that 79% of voters want to allow the Clean Water Rule to move forward. Further, the Clean Water Rule is based on sound science, including 1,200 peer-reviewed studies and extensive stakeholder outreach. This Rule is also good for business. The American Sustainable Business Council found in a survey that 80% of small business owners favor federal protections for clean water in small streams and headwaters. Repealing this rule would endanger more than 20 million acres of vital wetlands across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This repeal would reverse years of work that has gone into ensuring these waterways are protected from pollution.

Shifting Away from Coal Toward Renewable Energy,7/31/2017,"<p><em>This opinion piece appeared in the <a href=""http://www.observer-reporter.com/20170729/commentary_we_should_shift_away_from_coal_toward_renewables"">Washington Observer-Reporter </a>on July 29, 2017 in a point / counterpoint feature about the coal industry in Pennsylvania.</em></p>

<p>Any conversation about the future of coal must be candid about a number of realities. Our energy system is changing rapidly toward clean energy and away from fossil fuel. Our political class can either lead toward economic and environmental success or continue to bury its head in the sand and be defeated. Part of the problem is the public debate on coal has been layered with myths, misdirection, and lies that have derailed a forward-looking discussion on how we harness and use energy, as well as how it impacts hardworking Americans.</p>

<p>First, we must discuss the reality of climate change. The facts are clear: we cannot hope to keep the world&rsquo;s temperature at a safe level if we continue to rely on carbon-intensive fossil fuels like coal. The United States has already emitted more carbon pollution than any other country in history, and has a moral and ethical responsibility to do its fair share to mitigate the danger. Instead, our climate policy is rife with weakness, denial, and obstruction, rather than providing an economically beneficial pathway to a cleaner, prosperous energy future.</p>

<p>Second, coal remains dangerous to the communities that surround it. Burning coal releases a wide variety of cancer-causing, lung-damaging pollutants, including mercury, acid gases, and smog-forming pollutants, which result in hospitalizations and deaths. Coal mining itself permanently scars our environment and damages our land and water &ndash; just ask anyone in the old coal towns scattered around Pennsylvania. Coal isn&rsquo;t clean, and we can&rsquo;t forget how it has harmed generations of workers and communities.</p>

<p>Third, there is no such thing as a &ldquo;war on coal.&rdquo; Tree huggers, former presidents, and government regulations aren&rsquo;t killing coal. Rather, simple economics are leading to its demise as cheaper alternatives replace it in the market. Natural gas and renewable energy are winning the day. As a result, coal industry leaders are trying to cut every corner they can find. They&rsquo;re using automation to replace workers. They&rsquo;re spending money they say they don&rsquo;t have to lobby for even more government subsidies. And, in some high-profile cases, they have been caught cutting corners on their safety and environmental responsibilities. Underneath all of the war-on-coal rhetoric is a textbook case of industry trying to skirt its responsibilities to its workers and environment to make a few more dollars. We all pay the price.</p>

<p>Fourth, don&rsquo;t be duped by promises of metallurgic coal. Coal has been the main source of power for our blast furnaces and steel mills, but even so, its future is not assured. Steel manufacturers, such as U.S. Steel, are already publically discussing plans to replace coal and coke used in steel mills with natural gas as a cost-cutting measure, and the rise of international carbon tariffs could limit international markets for steel made in coal-fired mills.</p>

<p>Fifth, political leaders are doing coal workers a disservice. Rather than recognizing that the United States is under a generational shift in energy and providing support for its workers and a path to more prosperous jobs, they&rsquo;re instead providing lip service, myths, and false hope.</p>

<p>Policymakers should be passing legislation to rebuild old coal communities, fund reclamation of abandoned mining operations that are polluting our streams, and provide new job opportunities for coal miners. Coal workers have provided a critical service to society by lighting our homes and providing heating for our families. We should ensure that those workers are treated with respect and provided with good-paying jobs in new industries.</p>

<p>With the industry in a permanent state of decline, there are policy choices to be made. Doing nothing is probably the worst decision. If we take that path, we will face not only the worst effects of climate change, but the workers and the communities that rely on coal will continue to suffer.</p>

<p>Further subsidizing coal is an equally terrible choice. In Ohio, coal plant owners have lobbied to force consumers to pay above-market prices for coal power. Taking a similar path in Pennsylvania might keep coal plants profitable a little while longer, but will raise electricity prices. With many coal plants near the end of their expected lives, that would only be a short-term solution. When the inevitable collapse comes, the fall will be that much harder.</p>

<p>The best alternative is to provide real support to coal workers and provide them a path to work in next-generation energy industries. We must also account for the environmental and public health damage caused by coal and include that in the price &ndash; ending a significant subsidy to coal that it has benefitted from for more than 100 years. Pennsylvania can use that revenue from the cut subsidies to help coal communities rebuild their economies, clean up their coal piles, and provide cleaner, more prosperous jobs for its families.</p>

Legislators Target a Severance Tax – in Name Only,7/26/2017,"<p>Over the last few weeks, state legislators have <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Harrisburg-Punts-on-Environmental-Protection-in-the-State-Budget-Again"">prioritized raiding conservation funds </a>and cutting environmental protection agencies under the guise of getting serious about balancing the budget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was no more evident than when the House of Representatives recently considered a &ldquo;severance tax in name only,&rdquo; in which legislators proposed changing the name of the natural gas &ldquo;Impact Fee&rdquo; to &ldquo;severance tax.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>In other words, the House proposed last minute legislative deception to make it look like it passed new revenue.</strong> It&rsquo;s like saying they balanced the state budget by passing a law that changes the word &ldquo;debt&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;surplus,&rdquo; or rebranding carbon pollution as &ldquo;good for farmers and agriculture&rdquo; and calling it <a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/article/295098/carbon-emissions-are-good-robert-zubrin"">promising for the planet.</a></p>

<p><strong>The Fake Severance Tax Gambit</strong></p>

<p>On Saturday, July 21, the House was convened to develop, debate, and vote on bills that would raise enough revenue to pay for the budget the legislature passed a few weeks earlier. (i) Of environmental concern, legislators proposed taking money from funds dedicated to land conservation, supporting parks, farmland preservation, and water pollution projects to balance the budget. (ii)</p>

<p>The legislature doesn&rsquo;t have to take a sledgehammer to these programs as it has many other revenue options at its disposal, including some that have significant support among the general public. <strong>One of those ideas is implementing a severance tax on natural gas drilling, which has received support from <a href=""http://www.politicspa.com/rmu-poll-finds-support-of-same-sex-marriage-and-extraction-tax/58349/"">58 percent of the public when polled.&nbsp;</a></strong></p>

<p>As such, the House called an Energy and Environmental Resources Committee hearing on July 22&nbsp;to vote on severance tax proposals &ndash; House Bill 113 (Rep. Harper, R) &ndash; which would levy a 3.5 percent severance tax and use the revenue to pay down the pension liability and help balance the budget.</p>

<p><strong>Rather than take up the bill on its merits, House legislators concocted a plan to replace the bill with language that renames the already existing &ldquo;Impact Fee&rdquo; on gas wells a &ldquo;severance tax.&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><u><strong>I&rsquo;ll state that again so it sinks in:</strong></u><strong> Instead of debating a real severance tax, the legislature wanted to rename an existing fee, and call it a good day&rsquo;s work.</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, the House didn&rsquo;t follow through with the fake severance tax gambit because members were sent home after an overall budget agreement couldn&rsquo;t be made. But it&rsquo;s indicative of how many more of our legislators are interested in gutting conservation and environmental protection rather than coming up with an equitable budget solution that doesn&rsquo;t require doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania Doesn&rsquo;t Have a Severance Tax</strong></p>

<p>The fake severance tax gambit highlights the common myths holding back its passage, the most prominent being industry&rsquo;s charge that Pennsylvania already levies a severance tax and instead calls it by a different name &ndash; an &ldquo;Impact Fee.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s true that the Commonwealth charges a fee on gas wells, it&rsquo;s much different than a severance tax, and the distinction means Pennsylvania taxpayers are leaving hundreds of millions of dollars in potential revenue on the table.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Impact Fee is an annual charge on gas wells that is tiered to the price of natural gas and declines over time. It&rsquo;s structured to provide more revenue as the number of gas wells increases. Revenue flows back to municipalities to invest in fixing infrastructure degraded or oversubscribed by increased industrial use. It&rsquo;s a popular program and serves an important purpose, supporting local municipalities with small local tax bases to deal with rising infrastructure costs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a severance tax charges a percentage of the average market price of the gas extracted, plus a flat fee for every thousand cubic feet of gas extracted. It&rsquo;s structured to provide more revenue as the price of gas increases, or as the amount of extracted gas increases.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s easy to see why the gas industry doesn&rsquo;t want a severance tax and pushes the argument we already have one.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Their top goal is to increase the price of natural gas in Pennsylvania to increase their profits. They&rsquo;re doing so by limiting new drilling, and building new pipeline projects to sell the gas outside of the state and, more importantly, outside of the United States at a higher price.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As the value of gas increases, a severance tax would become more lucrative, whereas Impact Fee revenue would remain static or decline. Keeping the Impact Fee is more profitable to an already very profitable gas industry.</strong></p>

<p>This act of corporate trickery is having a ripple effect throughout the state budget.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.pennbpc.org/no-matter-how-you-figure-it-severance-tax-generates-more-revenue-impact-fee-and-clearly-better-deal"">The Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center estimates </a>that the Commonwealth would raise at least $480 million more revenue per year through a severance tax than the Impact Fee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other words, Pennsylvania is leaving a significant amount of budget revenue on the table by not levying a severance tax and are instead cutting core environmental protection programs to try and balance the budget.</p>

<p><strong>Calling a Spade a Spade</strong></p>

<p>To be fair, balancing the budget always includes a mix of budget cuts and new revenue. Both are needed to equitably close a <a href=""http://www.witf.org/state-house-sound-bites/2017/06/breaking-down-the-budget-the-political-path-to-pas-structural-deficit.php"">$3 billion structural deficit</a> that has dragged on too long. Calling a spade a spade, the legislature isn&rsquo;t acting fairly and is eviscerating environmental protection and conservation programs and selling it as needed budget cuts.</p>

<p>For over a decade, the legislature has stripped to the bone the Commonwealth&rsquo;s environmental protection programs and support for our parks and forests. These agencies currently can&rsquo;t complete their most basic functions, like protecting the public&rsquo;s <a href=""http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2017/02/02/u-s-warns-pennsylvania-over-safe-drinking-water-violations/"">drinking water</a> or cleaning up the <a href=""http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/pennsylvania-lags-on-chesapeake-bay-cleanup/article_2ff5229e-40ba-11e6-98be-df8ac8dc9c42.html"">Susquehanna River basin</a>. Parks and forests are understaffed and are sitting on years of past maintenance backlog <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2013/02/senate-budget-hearing-dcnr-has-1.html"">exceeding $1 billion.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Certainly, times are tough for state budgeting, but these fundamental state programs have given <a href=""http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/2017/06/house-senate-governor-agree-on-31996b.html"">more than enough</a> toward balancing the budget. Rather than dangerously cutting environmental protection programs yet again, as well as taking dedicated money from land conservation and water projects, legislators need to look elsewhere to balance their budget.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This includes taking a hard look at their rhetoric around a severance tax (and other potential revenue raisers) and asking whether protecting <a href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/26/can-the-marcellus-shale-continue-fueling-big-profi.aspx"">soaring</a> gas industry profits is worth harming the Commonwealth&rsquo;s environment and public health.</strong></p>

<p><em>(i)Note that the legislature already slashed environmental investments this year. The FY2017-18 budget cuts water, land, and air protection and conservation programs by 2 percent to 7 percent compared to last year&rsquo;s budget (and up to 33 percent compared to these budgets 15 years ago).<br />
&nbsp;(ii)Specifically, the legislature was targeting: (1) Environmental Stewardship Fund, which supports everything from greenways, trails, and community parks to water cleanup and wildlife habitat protection; (2) Keystone Recreation, Park, and Conservation Fund, which is the chief way Pennsylvania conserves and protects public lands and historic sites as well as invests in libraries, public parks, and new lands for recreation; and (3) Farmland Preservation Fund, which is how state and county governments purchase conservation easements to preserve Pennsylvania farms to slow the selloff of those lands for development.</em></p>

Meet the Donor: Rodney Gasch,7/25/2017,"<p>Rodney Gasch, a retired freelance writer and current president of the Latin American Children&rsquo;s Fund and president of Historic Harmony, Inc., has been a long-time PennFuture donor. In 2016, Rodney and his wife, Laurie, decided to change things up and become monthly supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Rodney said, &ldquo;Giving once a year is important, but PennFuture, like most nonprofits, has expenses 12 months a year.&rdquo; It was an easy decision for he and his wife to make the switch.</p>

<p>Rodney grew up in eastern Wisconsin on a small family dairy farm. His father participated in land conservation and farmed carefully to avoid soil erosion, giving Rodney the bird&rsquo;s eye view to learn about the importance of both stewardship of the land, and erosion control.</p>

<p>On their farm, they practiced contour tillage (tilling perpendicular to a slope), strip cropping (alternating long strips of row crops, such as corn, with long strips of dense hay crops) &nbsp;and utilized &nbsp;grass waterways (broad, shallow channels planted in grass that &nbsp;move surface water across slopes without causing soil erosion).</p>

<p>In 1993, Rodney and his wife moved to Pennsylvania as Laurie accepted a position at the University of Pittsburgh. They bought a non-functioning farm with a great barn and nice farmhouse. Most of the land had grown in with trees. &nbsp;While it is beautiful to look at, Rodney says the most successful plants on the farm seem to be poison ivy, multi flora rose, and autumn olive, the latter two growing into dense thickets that can crowd out native species. &nbsp;Rodney worked in marketing communications as a freelance writer, specializing in product literature and direct mail for agricultural and equipment manufacturers.</p>

<p>Rodney and Laurie are the proud parents of William and Noah, whom they adopted from El Salvador and Guatemala, respectively. Their first adoption 27 years ago spurred an interest in the boys&#39; cultures, but Rodney did not get heavily involved in charity work in Central America until 2006.</p>

<p>At the Latin American Children&#39;s fund, Rodney and his team raise money for a rural medical clinic in El Salvador, as well as helping the poor with micro enterprises that build economic stability and self-worth. In Guatemala, a program provides scholarships to help children continue their educations past the sixth grade. Working with local charities that have &ldquo;boots on the ground,&rdquo; they direct their efforts toward issues that are way beyond the reach of rural poor and subsistence farmers.</p>

<p>Historic Harmony, Inc. was founded in 1943, and operates eight properties, including the 1809 Harmony Museum building, which interprets 250 years of rich history in western Pennsylvania. The group provides presentations that include the topics of George Washington&#39;s 1753 mission, the Harmonists, Mennonites, and the Ball Collection of outstanding sporting rifles by 19th century Harmony gunsmith Charles Flowers. Historic Harmony is also home to the oldest Mennonite meetinghouse west of the Allegheny Mountains. It was recently added to the National Register of Historic Places.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Historic Harmony, Inc. asked for PennFuture&rsquo;s help to take on a developer who planned to fill and develop a farm field in a flood plain. While Historic Harmony, Inc. wasn&rsquo;t able to stop the entire process, with PennFuture&rsquo;s help, the organization gained a better understanding of what it could do to prevent the size and scope of the development. Through these efforts, Historic Harmony, Inc. was able to identify and protect several acres of wetlands and prevent the development in the flood way.</p>

<p>Rodney first became interested in supporting PennFuture when Marcellus gas development became a larger statewide topic. Rodney and his wife were some of the first people to sign a Marcellus gas lease in Butler County, long before Marcellus, fracking, and horizontal drilling became household terms. They quickly learned that without strong rules and vigilant oversight, gas companies were prone to cut corners, especially on environmental issues. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their goals are speed and profits, not land stewardship,&rdquo; notes Rodney. He and his wife felt it was fitting to put some of the money they received from gas development back into a group that would strive to enforce those rules, and be the watchdog over gas drillers and the legislature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We got to thinking, who&#39;s going to speak for the environment? &nbsp;Businesses speak for their bottom line. &nbsp;Gas folks can influence the legislature. Who speaks for the land and the water and the air?&rdquo; Rodney thought PennFuture was the best group to stand up for those issues.</p>

<p>In terms of gas drilling, Rodney is not opposed to resource development, but feels that development must be done with a keen eye toward long-term environmental impact.</p>

<p>&quot;Initially, the technology of gas extraction was way ahead of the rules. &nbsp;We have made some progress, but if we didn&rsquo;t have an organization like PennFuture pushing back against the gas drillers and pipeline companies, we could easily repeat the environmental mistakes made In Pennsylvania in the 19th and 20th centuries&mdash;mistakes that gave us acid mine drainage, methane leaks, and abandoned strip mines,&rdquo; Rodney said.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
PennFuture thanks Rodney and Laurie for their monthly support.</p>

Oil Trains: What is the Threat?,7/12/2017,"<p>People have lived amongst trains for more than 200 years. Trains are by far one of the oldest and most successful vehicles of world history, delivering goods and people quickly and efficiently across the United States and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it is an incredible machine navigating an incredible rail system, I am often struck by a different perspective of the train, the goods they can carry, and what they represent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I began to wonder and really think about oil trains about two years ago, when I discovered oil trains have been running through my community. Since then, oil trains have become one of my all-time favorite talking points, and learning about them has changed my life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny to me now that I have been hearing the whistle of these trains in the far away distance at night since I was a kid. I grew up in Southwest Philadelphia, and oil trains have been a part of my life for years even though I didn&rsquo;t know about them.</p>

<p>Now that I recognize oil trains&mdash;which can have more than 100 cars at one time&mdash;they are hard to miss. Just knowing the cars that they carry are filled with volatile crude oil has changed the way I see these trains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing the black tanker cars feels like a slap in my face, and an annoyance that keeps popping up in the most unexpected places. These black, pill-shaped disasters-just-waiting-to-happen continuously show up in our neighborhoods. I no longer have to search for them; instead it feels like they are looking for me.</p>

<p>The presence of oil trains in my city, and in the other communities is the embodiment of intimidation. My relationship with these black tanker cars has transformed into one that feels strange and slightly personal. In my head, oil trains are the physical representation of the terms, ideas and institutions that shape our reality. When I see oil trains, I hear the tanker cars whisper, &ldquo;capitalism,&rdquo; &rdquo;classism,&rdquo; &ldquo;colonialism,&rdquo; &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; &ldquo;industry deregulation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;powerlessness.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>See, in my eyes, fractivism (anti-fracking activism), and activism around the reality of oil trains are spiritual practices. There is a subliminal message that each tanker car delivers to the communities that they travel through, and a destructive aura that each tanker car exudes. When I look at these trains and listen to their sounds, I hear them spew messages like: &ldquo;This is how things are and will continue to be.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are powerless to change our fossil fuel economy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your health and safety means nothing to the interests of industry and their beneficiaries.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are inferior to the systems that uphold destructive power dynamics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the movement and saying, &ldquo;STOP OIL TRAINS!&rdquo; have become a war cry for activists like me for this very reason. Halting the use of oil trains has the potential to end a lot of the negative things that travel with them. It can end community members having to ask questions like: &ldquo;What is in these tanker cars?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Where are these trains coming from?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And ultimately, if we stop oil trains, it can end community members having to ask, &ldquo;What will happen if one of these trains derails?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am currently attending school in Kutztown, Pa. and I still see oil trains traveling through a nearby town named Topton. I haven&rsquo;t heard anyone in this area speak up against oil trains, which feels similar to my experience living in Southwest Philly, and even how I feel now living in Southeast Delaware County (where I have also seen many oil trains passing through).&nbsp;</p>

<p>One consistent observation that I&rsquo;ve had in all of these communities is that the people most impacted and most vulnerable to an oil trains disaster know little to nothing about the existence of them. And that is by far the most frustrating (and motivating) part of this work.</p>

<p>Whenever I travel or move I find oil trains and community members who don&rsquo;t yet know the danger traveling with those tanker cars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We must inform the people who don&rsquo;t know about the presence and dangers of oil trains and get them involved in standing up for their communities. If we can take that first step together, and if everyone living in a neighborhood next to these oil train routes can also see the reality of oil trains that I see (as a slap in the face to all communities with a right to a safe environment), then I believe that we can begin to make a bigger push to move away from reckless fracking and fossil fuel transportation.</p>

Managing Stormwater: A Leading Cause of Pollution,7/7/2017,"<div>Believe it or not: Stormwater is a leading cause of water pollution.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>When it rains or snows, the water flows on the ground, runs off solid (impervious) surfaces collecting pollutants (such as oil, pesticides, sediments, bacteria, and other pollutants) that are on those surfaces, and carries them into our waterways. This &ldquo;runoff&rdquo; can make our waterways an unhealthy place to live, work, and play. Untreated stormwater runoff entering our streams can result in the contamination of our drinking water supplies; prohibitions on swimming, fishing or boating uses; injury or death to aquatic plants and animals; dangers to public health; and increased flooding. &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In many places, this stormwater runoff is conveyed through distinct sewer pipes that bypass the wastewater treatment plants and discharge the polluted runoff directly into our streams and lakes. This system is known as a &ldquo;municipal separate storm sewer system&rdquo; or MS4.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In addition to the damage to water quality from MS4s, local governments spend millions of dollars each year trying to rectify the damage to public and private property caused by uncontrolled stormwater runoff. &nbsp;This damage includes repairs to roads, culverts, water, sewer line washouts, flooded homes and yards, the removal of deposited sediment and debris on properties and roads, and repairs of damage to bridges.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Luckily, there are laws out there that protect our waters from polluted stormwater runoff. For example, stormwater from &ldquo;urbanized (define here what that means) areas&rdquo;, which are densely settled area that have population of at least 50,000 as designated by the U.S. Census Bureau, &nbsp;is controlled through a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit under the federal Clean Water Act. &nbsp;Under the NPDES program, the Environmental Protection Agency began issuing Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permits almost 30 years ago. &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In order to obtain coverage under an MS4 permit, permittees, including municipalities, must implement a Stormwater Management Plan (&ldquo;SWMP&rdquo;). &nbsp;These SWMPs must include the development and implementation of &ldquo;six minimum measures&rdquo; that prevent or reduce stormwater pollution to the maximum extent possible. The six minimum control measures are:&nbsp;</div>

<ol>
	<li>Public Education and Outreach on Stormwater Impacts</li>
	<li>Public Involvement/Participation&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination (IDDE)</li>
	<li>Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Post-Construction Stormwater Management (PCSM)&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<div><a href=""http://www.pennfuture.org/Files/Admin/FINAL-Guidelines-for-Reviewing-and-Commenting-on-Municipal-Separate-Storm-Sewer-System-Minimum-Control-Measures.pdf""><strong>You can learn more about the MS4 program and the six minimum control measures here</strong></a>.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In Pennsylvania, the Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) administers the MS4program. &nbsp;PADEP issued its first general permit for MS4s in 2003. &nbsp;Although each permit is only supposed to be effective for five years, the PADEP&rsquo;s second MS4 general permit did not become effective until 2013. &nbsp;Even then, after over 10 years of the program&rsquo;s implementation, this second MS4 permit was woefully insufficient. &nbsp;PennFuture took issue with the inadequacy of the PADEP&rsquo;s MS4 program and filed an appeal of PADEP&rsquo;s approval of coverage under the MS4 general permit for Upper Gwynedd Township. &nbsp;(PA Environmental Hearing Board Docket No. 2013-105-L). You can read more about <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/cases"">PennFuture&rsquo;s claims here</a>.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>After over a year of negotiations, PennFuture and PADEP entered into a settlement which addressed PennFuture&rsquo;s most important objections, including providing an opportunity for public participation and requiring a demonstration that designated pollution reductions would occur. &nbsp;Thanks to PennFuture&rsquo;s diligence, PADEP was required to include these more stringent conditions in its next MS4 general permit proposal. &nbsp;Many of these conditions were incorporated into <a href=""http://www.elibrary.dep.state.pa.us/dsweb/Get/Document-112608/3800-PM-BCW0100d%20Permit%20SAMPLE%20with%20Signature%20(Final).pdf)"">the new five-year MS4 general permit,</a> which became final in June 2016 and goes into effect in March 2018.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Even though the new MS4 general permit does not go into effect until March of 2018, there are things that must be done now. &nbsp;This summer (2017) municipalities must prepare pollution reduction plans (PRPs) and make these plans available for public review and comment. &nbsp;The PRPs assist MS4 municipalities to understand their obligations regarding &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; waters and must include the following:</div>

<ul>
	<li>A detailed map,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>An explanation of the current pollutant loads in local waterways,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A description of best management practices (BMPs) to be implemented over the five year term of the permit and demonstration that these BMPs will reduce pollutants by specified amounts,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A description of how the municipality expects to pay for implementation of their plan, and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A description of the operation and maintenance of proposed BMPs.</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture will be reviewing and commenting on some of these MS4 PRPs this summer, but we need engagement from community members to ensure that stormwater doesn&rsquo;t harm our waters. &nbsp;</p>

Oil Trains and the Threat to Our Communities and Environment,7/6/2017,"<p>Oil trains are dangerous. On July 6, 2013 &ndash; exactly four years ago today - a runaway oil train brought tragedy and devastation to a community in in Lac-M&eacute;gantic, Quebec when it derailed and ignited 1.5 million gallons of crude oil, destroying buildings and ending the lives of 47 people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On this four-year commemoration of that tragic event, trains continue to travel through Lac-M&eacute;gantic and many other communities, serving as a reminder of the risk we face when our reliance on dirty energy trumps the safety of our communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 700,000 Philadelphia residents (and more statewide) live in proximity to the rail routes that run crude oil near their yards, past their hospitals and childcare centers, and alongside their bike paths and highways. Trains carrying hazardous and highly flammable liquids even run alongside and cross our drinking water sources, even though the consequences of a spill or accident could impact the public health and safety of millions of people. In Pennsylvania, there is poor oversight of railroad bridges, a lack of transparency, and minimal access to rail maintenance records, along with insufficient penalties for regulatory violations.</p>

<p><strong>We cannot wait for another disaster to hit before taking action. </strong>We need stronger safeguards to protect our communities and our environment. As the federal government continues to pursue a regulatory reform agenda to &ldquo;alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens,&rdquo; (1) we will continue to see threats to our health, safety, and natural resources in the pursuit of dirty energy production. One of the first things we can do to come together to defend our communities is to speak up with them. Jeremy Griffin is one Philadelphia resident who has decided to do just that, and share his story on oil trains and the risks that we face.&nbsp;</p>

Harrisburg Punts on Environmental Protection in the State Budget (Again),6/30/2017,"<div>At the 11th hour, the House, Senate, and Governor&rsquo;s office agreed to a General Appropriations budget for FY2017-18 that continues a funding crisis for environmental protection that started more than a decade ago.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The chief environmental protection agencies &ndash; Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) - have been systematically underfunded. Under the auspices of tough budget times and belt tightening, key programs have been cut or eliminated. Staffing has been reduced, putting public health at even greater risk. Yet, the environmental challenges impacting Pennsylvania continue to grow.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-A-Primer-on-Pennsylvanias-Water-Crisis-Challenges-Impacting-Every-Community"">For example, the Commonwealth&rsquo;s water pollution challenges are growing in every corner of the state</a>, yet the DEP&rsquo;s Operational Budget, which supports water programs, was cut another 3.85 percent from the previous year. Since 2002-03, DEP&rsquo;s Operations Budget is down nearly 34 percent. Growing Greener investments through the Environmental Stewardship Fund have decreased by 75 percent. And the budget deal cut the critical water commissions, including the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC) and Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), by a whopping 50 percent.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>There is truly only one way to describe the overall budget deal: it&rsquo;s awful for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment.</strong> It ensures that the biggest challenges facing our public lands, water, air, and climate will not be addressed for at least another year, and probably longer.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Specifically, the following are some of the major concerns from the budget deal:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><u><strong>Department of Environmental Protection</strong></u></div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The overall General Fund DEP budget ($147.72 million):</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>2.04% cut compared to the FY16-17 budget</li>
		<li>38.93% cut compared to the FY02-03 budget</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>DEP General Operations budget ($13.394 million):</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>3.85% cut compared to the FY16-17 budget</li>
		<li>33.88% cut compared to the FY02-03 budget</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Water Commissions take a devastating budget cut:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>SRBC, DRBC, Rivermaster for the Delaware River, Interstate Commission for the Potomac River Basin, and Interstate Mining Commission all take a 50% cut compared to the FY16-17 budget</li>
		<li>Chesapeake Bay Commission budget held steady at $275,000</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</strong></u></p>

<p>The overall DCNR budget:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>6.29% cut in General Fund appropriations compared to the FY16-17 budget</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>7.8% cut in General Fund appropriations compared to the FY02-03 budget</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Budget deal shifts money from Oil and Gas Lease Fund</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The budget takes $50 million from the oil and gas royalties on state lands and provides it for General Operations</li>
		<li>It provides an additional $11.2 million from royalty revenue to the operations of State Parks and State Forests, which is an 83% reduction compared to the original House and Governor budget proposals</li>
		<li>The continued use of oil and gas royalty revenue for general operations raises questions due to the recent Supreme Court decision on interpreting Article 1, Section 27 of the state constitution.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Additionally, the budget deal does not include, at this time, the bond proposal introduced in the Governor&rsquo;s budget that would have increased DCNR&rsquo;s water program budgets significantly.</li>
</ul>

<div>For many of the issues impacting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment, the costs will only continue to increase the longer they go unabated. One only has to look at the decades of inaction around coal mining impacts on our waterways and the $15 billion liability to the Pennsylvania taxpayer currently estimated to clean up those culm piles and streams. We&rsquo;re making similar mistakes with Pennsylvania&rsquo;s drinking water, unconventional drilling, climate change, and air pollution challenges.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>State budgets are the ultimate reflection of policymaking priorities and for over a decade, environmental protection has been cut, and in many instances eviscerated. Our state priorities are out of whack and need to be changed before the problems become intractable and the harm to our citizens grows more severe.</strong></div>

<p>Luzerne County communities are banding together to solve an expensive problem &ndash; uncontrolled stormwater pollution of local streams and the Susquehanna River. The substantial costs of installing stormwater controls, separating stormwater pipes from sewer pipes, and adopting the best ways to minimize stormwater pollution, like street sweeping, will be shared among 37 municipalities, lowering the expenses for the taxpayers. It will be funded by a stormwater fee assessed on each property of between $3.00 and $4.50 per month.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania&rsquo;s famously fractured local government system, it&rsquo;s a rare, great example of inter-governmental cooperation. You&rsquo;d think that the local officials involved would be boasting to taxpayers about how they can cooperatively clean up local waterways at reduced cost. Instead, they complained. One local official said, &ldquo;The public has to understand this is another unfunded mandate, and either their municipality is going to do it or the Wyoming Valley Sanitary Authority.&rdquo; This is simply not true.</p>

<p><strong>Clean Water is Not an Unfunded Mandate</strong></p>

<p>Clean water is not an unfunded mandate and this pervasive myth needs to end. Under Pennsylvania law and our state constitution, keeping our water clean is the responsibility of state and local government. Clean water is essential for health, industry and agriculture. But, let&rsquo;s be honest. Clean water is not free. It costs money to protect clean water, and it costs even more to clean up polluted water. That money has to come from somewhere. If we want clean water, we will have to pay for it.</p>

<p>The bad news is that the cleanup costs are daunting. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Susquehanna River/Chesapeake Bay cleanup - $647 million a year;</li>
	<li>Replace Pittsburgh&rsquo;s lead water pipes - $411 million;</li>
	<li>Clean up streams polluted by coal mining - $ 1 billion;</li>
	<li>Eliminate combined sewer overflows statewide - $28 billion.</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that, like the innovative, cooperative effort in Luzerne County and similar projects in other counties, including York and Lancaster, there are solutions that are ready to be implemented that minimize costs, and there are proposed solutions that would provide the resources to tackle our water protection and cleanup challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Investment is Critical</strong></p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s the duty of state and local governments to address water pollution challenges, the federal government also plays a role. In particular, the federal government has an obligation to address pollution challenges that cross state boundaries, such as those impacting many of our watersheds, through federal oversight and adequate funding.</p>

<p>Yet, federal policymakers have not made it easy on the states by continually cutting or underfunding key water pollution programs. For example, Congress must fully fund the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Chesapeake Bay Program. The EPA and Bay Program provide about $140 million a year to Pennsylvania farmers and municipalities to finance water pollution control projects. The Trump administration has proposed slashing the EPA budget by 30 percent and eliminating the Chesapeake Bay Program. These funding cuts would be devastating to the Susquehanna River cleanup effort, just as the federal Bay pollution limits are starting to show water quality improvements.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Congress could play a significant role in helping clean up acid mine drainage sites by passing the RECLAIM Act (H.R. 1731), which would accelerate the disbursement of $1 billion from the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund over five years. For Pennsylvania, this would mean more than $60 million in additional funding for mine reclamation each year for five years &ndash; an enormous increase in projects that would clean up water pollution as well as provide local economic benefits.</p>

<p><strong>State Policymakers Need to Aggressively Lead on Eliminating Water Pollution</strong></p>

<p>For its part, the Pennsylvania legislature has to really step up and lead. For too long, policymakers have cut water pollution programs &ndash; and environmental programs in general. As a result, water programs are run understaffed, without many inspectors, and little funds to provide reasonable oversight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, state policymakers should increase funding to the Department of Environmental Protection so it has the resources to carry out its mission. DEP received $246 million in state funding in 2002. This year, the Governor&rsquo;s proposed budget earmarks only $152 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The House Budget bill (HB 218) calls for a 10 percent cut to general operations, which funds the agency&rsquo;s water pollution programs. Years of declining funding have left the agency woefully understaffed to the point where it cannot adequately review permit applications in a timely manner or do the number of inspections of drinking water treatment, wastewater treatment and agricultural operations to ensure compliance with pollution control laws.</p>

<p>But, state lawmakers shouldn&rsquo;t stop at simply making DEP&rsquo;s budget whole again. They should also provide more funding for clean water projects across the Commonwealth through dedicated revenue streams, including those to address pollution problems in the Susquehanna River watershed as well as lead, pharmaceutical, and PFOA pollution issues. For example, Governor Wolf&rsquo;s proposed budget once again included levying a severance tax on Marcellus shale gas drilling - a 6.5 percent tax on gas production would bring about $293 million into state coffers rising to about $500 million by 2020. A portion of that should be dedicated to water pollution control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another way to fund water projects is through a water user fee. Rep. Mike Sturla (D-Lancaster) has introduced legislation to enact a fee on water users that use more than 10,000 gallons of water per day to create a Clean Water Fund. Such a fee would generate about $245 million a year for clean water projects. Earlier this year, Pennsylvania legislators who are members of the Chesapeake Bay Commission endorsed the concept in a letter to other members of the Pennsylvania House and Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The General Assembly should also renew the Growing Greener program, which provides grants directly to municipalities, restoration organizations and farmers to do local water quality protection and cleanup projects. Since the $625 million Growing Greener II bond was overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2005, funding for Growing Greener has declined by 75 percent. The Growing Greener Coalition has identified the need for $315 million a year for farmland, open space protection, and water restoration and protection projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Local Governments Should View Water Pollution as a Central Challenge</strong></p>

<p>Finally, local governments should adopt policies and implement projects to control polluted runoff, which would in turn help guide farmers who need more information and assistance in complying with pollution control laws and adopting agricultural practices that minimize pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Municipalities can adopt ordinances that require developers to maintain a vegetated setback from streams for residential and commercial developments. They can also participate in joint projects like the ones in Luzerne, Lancaster and York counties to control pollution in a cost-effective manner and further minimize cost by including &ldquo;green infrastructure&rdquo; like rain gardens and constructed wetlands to hold back and filter polluted stormwater. Municipalities can finance clean water projects by charging fees on properties based on the amount of impervious surfaces the properties contain, thus scaling funding to the amount of polluted waters a property creates.</p>

<p>Farmers can adopt a whole range of water-friendly practices such as limiting their use of fertilizers and manure to the amount needed to produce abundant crops, limiting their disturbance of soil when preparing fields, and installing forested buffers between their fields and streams.</p>

<p>The solutions to our water quality problems are there, though they&rsquo;re certainly not easy. Nonetheless, if we want clean water, we must insist that our federal, state and local officials provide the policies, incentives and resources to get the job done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of us must understand that clean water is not free, and we all must be willing to pay our fair share to ensure that our families and our communities can depend on the safety of the water flowing in our streams and coming out of our taps.&nbsp;</p>

Part I: A Primer on Pennsylvania’s Water Crisis - Challenges Impacting Every Community,6/27/2017,"<p><strong><em>This primer is Part 1 in a two part series, <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Pennsylvanias-History-with-Water-Pollution-Policy"">with a sidebar providing a brief history of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s policy fight for clean water,</a> a description of the water pollution challenges impacting Pennsylvanians, and the potential solutions toward providing clean water for all. <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Pennsylvanias-History-with-Water-Pollution-Policy"">For a deeper dive into our state&rsquo;s storied water pollution policy history, click here.</a></em></strong></p>

<p>When astronomers discover planets orbiting far-off stars, they assess whether or not that world could support life by determining if water is present. Their assumption, based on our own experience here on Earth, is that water is the basis of all life. It is our most precious natural resource. It is our most visceral connection to the natural world.</p>

<p>Yet, one of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s great historic struggles is providing every citizen access to clean water for drinking, recreation, farming, and industry. It&rsquo;s an unfortunate story of the Commonwealth turning a blind eye to pollution for the benefit of industry, failing to lead in times of crisis, and ignoring water pollution problems for so long, they&rsquo;re almost intractable.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say Pennsylvania hasn&rsquo;t had successes. For more than a century, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s communities and policymakers have worked to clean up our streams and rivers, resulting in significant policy wins and strong regulations. But the struggle for clean water continues today in every county, municipality, and city.</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Growing Water Crisis</strong></p>

<p>This century-long history of working towards policy that protects our waterways from pollution while we also invest in the restoration of our waterways has shown much progress. Culm piles have been reclaimed, many industrial discharges have been reduced, and billions of dollars have been invested in wastewater treatment, sewage systems, and stormwater controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Pennsylvania is facing a growing water crisis from a mix of legacy water pollution sources and emerging pollutants and industrial activity. From lead-contaminated drinking water in Pittsburgh, to sick and dying fish in the Susquehanna, to rainwater runoff contaminated with industrial pollutants in the Delaware, our rivers and streams are stressed and overburdened, with many showing signs of ecological decline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, after a century of water pollution policies, more than 20,000 miles of Commonwealth streams still fail to meet the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s goals of being fishable and swimmable. There remains up to $15 billion in acid mine drainage cleanup across the state. It&rsquo;s estimated that there are more than 200,000 orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells, potentially contaminating ground water. Pennsylvania has significantly failed to meet its pollution reduction goals set by the EPA in the Susquehanna River watershed, with more than 70 percent of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s farmers in the watershed failing to meet basic pollution-reduction planning requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The toughest pollution problems remain, and they grow by the day. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no single villain. All of us contribute to water pollution. We&rsquo;ve neglected our drinking water pipes, paved over our watersheds, loaded tons of manure and fertilizer on our farm fields, allowed pollution laws to go unenforced, allowed new industries like unconventional gas drilling to go under-regulated, failed to prevent development on tree-lined stream banks, failed to eliminate acid mine drainage, dumped pharmaceuticals down the toilet or in our streams?, and starved the government agencies charged with protecting our water of adequate financial, technical and professional resources. Pollution problemsare widespread and expensive to address.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges Impacting Our Major Watersheds</strong></p>

<p>All of our great river basins, the Allegheny, Delaware, Susquehanna, and Lake Erie, face similar threats. Old sewer pipes throughout Pennsylvania cities carry both stormwater and sewage, and when it rains, raw sewage ends up in the citys&rsquo; rivers. As a result, places like the lower Delaware River and its estuary are contaminated with toxic chemicals. The river has a temporary reprieve from further damage through a &ldquo;moratorium&rdquo; on gas drilling currently in place through the Delaware River Basin Commission, and the horror of the so-called Energy Hub at the Port of Philadelphia seems stopped for now. &nbsp;But both defenses can change at any moment.</p>

<p>There is no better example of the monumental challenges we face in the work to reduce water pollution in all of our rivers than the Susquehanna River. The Susquehanna watershed drains rainwater that falls on 27,500 square miles of Pennsylvania cities, suburbs, highways, forests and farms, and receives wastewater from thousands of municipal and industrial treatment plants. Ultimately, these pollutants are harming fish and wildlife, reducing recreational opportunities, and making their way into the Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the middle and lower parts of the river were once renowned for its bass fishery, which attracted anglers from near and far. But beginning in 2005, the bass population began to crash. Young fish were not surviving and many that did were sick and dying. Adult fish reproductive systems showed characteristics of both sexes.&nbsp;<br />
Several years of study turned up few surprises. The river is polluted with nutrients, sediment, agricultural chemicals and drugs. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, angler organizations and environmental groups formally asked the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to declare the river &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; so that a specific cleanup plan could be developed to reduce the pollution. DEP issued a very limited impairment determination for only four miles of the river that did not address the major sources of the river&rsquo;s pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is also legally required by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to meet specific reductions of nutrient and sediment pollution going into the Susquehanna under the Chesapeake Bay cleanup plan. By far, the largest source of nutrient pollution - nitrogen and phosphorous - and sediment pollution come from agriculture, and many agricultural operations have not invested in adequate pollution control practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pennsylvania is significantly behind in meeting the required pollution reductions, most of which must come from agriculture and local controls on stormwater runoff from developed areas. Recently, the EPA sent a letter to DEP warning the state that if it does not come up with an adequately funded, viable plan to meet the reduction goals, it will impose penalties and its own cleanup plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The EPA estimates that Pennsylvania will have to spend between $50 million and $80 million per year to help farmers reduce pollution and between $200 to $300 million per year overall to address these challenges. But Pennsylvania has actually reduced its spending on programs to aid farm pollution control by about $20 million since 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Can Pennsylvania Keep Drinking Water Safe?</strong></p>

<p>Nothing ties us more intimately to our water resources than the water that comes out of our taps. We expect that the water delivered to our homes by water companies and municipal water authorities will be safe for drinking. But increasingly, that expectation is not being met. Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Allentown, and other Pennsylvania towns and cities are grappling with lead-contaminated water caused by ancient lead-based water pipes.</p>

<p>Alarmingly, DEP&rsquo;s program to ensure safe drinking water is woefully understaffed. The program is so underfunded that the federal EPA notified Pennsylvania that the inability of inspectors to adequately oversee drinking water systems and enforce the law poses &ldquo;serious public health implications.&rdquo; An EPA review found that key information about lead and copper levels in drinking water systems was missing from DEP inspection files. The situation is so bad, that EPA threatened to take away the state&rsquo;s authority to run the clean drinking water program.</p>

<p>The situation is no better in places like Montgomery and Bucks Counties, where communities near military bases have been poisoned by Perfluorooctanoic Acids (PFOS and PFOA&rsquo;s), chemicals used in firefighting foams. The chemicals infiltrated water wells near the military bases the foams were used and have led to contamination levels up to 15 times the federal limit, which can cause cancer, liver disorders, and other life threatening diseases.</p>

Pennsylvania’s History with Water Pollution Policy,6/27/2017,"<p><em>This blog post serves as an historical sidebar to a larger exploration entitled,&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-A-Primer-on-Pennsylvanias-Water-Crisis-Challenges-Impacting-Every-Community"">A Primer on Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Water Crisis: Challenges Impacting Every Community</a>.</strong> <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-A-Primer-on-Pennsylvanias-Water-Crisis-Challenges-Impacting-Every-Community"">Click here to view the full blog post</a> and be sure to read Part II <a href=""https://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Part-II-A-Primer-on-Pennsylvanias-Water-Crisis-Solutions"">by clicking here.</a></em></p>

<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s first statewide policy for preventing water pollution was the Purity of Waters Act of 1905, which set the first limits on how much &ldquo;sewage&rdquo; could be placed into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways. Unfortunately, the law specifically exempted discharges from coal mines and tanneries, which were some of the largest water polluters in the state at the time and influential in state politics. In fact, the law was enacted only after an outbreak of typhoid fever.</p>

<p>As orange streams, black snow, and water pollution grew significantly, Pennsylvania enacted the Clean Streams Law of 1937, which expanded penalties on polluters and strengthened discharge limits. Unfortunately, the law did not require polluters to restore degraded waterways and it continued exempting discharges from coal mines until &ldquo;practical means for the removal of the polluting properties shall become known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Clean Streams Law was significantly amended in 1945 to include coal mine discharges under the regulations and penalties, as well as require industry to develop and implement a plan for reducing pollution discharges. The Sanitary Water Board and Department of Mines were charged with enforcing these rules, though that enforcement was modest at best.</p>

<p>Yet, the Clean Streams Law was not wholly effective at the time. The number of polluted stream miles continued to increase and the state was incapable of keeping up with the industrial activity overwhelming our waterways. The Commonwealth began taking steps to turn the corner on its water crisis by amending the Clean Streams Law again in 1965 to require industries to restore degraded waterways as well as prevent their pollution. Regulations around discharges and in particular, coal mining, were significantly strengthened. Additional amendments in 1970 provided the Sanitary Water Board full regulatory authority over industrial activities that impact water.</p>

<p>During the 1960&rsquo;s, as more Americans became involved in environmental causes, Pennsylvania began investing in cleaning up water polluting sites, such as Project 70, which created the authority to issue bonds and utilize eminent domain to purchase open spaces for conservation reasons. This led to the creation of numerous state parks that protected not only land, but critical waterways as well. The Land and Water Conservation and Reclamation Act (Project 500) was enacted in 1968 to direct $200 million into abandoned mine reclamation, a lasting water pollution source after decades of mismanagement.</p>

<p>New federal environmental regulations, such as the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 and the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (otherwise known as the Clean Water Act) took the innovative step of providing a federal backstop to push states to strengthen their environmental policies. This led to Pennsylvania strengthening rules on drinking water, provisions for Lake Erie, new standards for wetlands, and strengthened permits for industrial activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PA Department of Environmental Resources (DER) was also created in 1970 to provide additional capacity. And in 1971, Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly supported the ratification of Article 1, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution that states that people &ldquo;have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic values of the environment&rdquo; and the Commonwealth is a &ldquo;trustee of these resources&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1999, Pennsylvania passed the first Growing Greener legislation, which invested $650 million into land conservation and water pollution restoration projects. A second Growing Greener was enacted in 2005. The EPA implemented federal pollution restrictions on the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which includes Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Susquehanna River watershed, in 2010, which requires significant reductions in stormwater, agriculture, and industrial pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But since Growing Greener, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s investment in water restoration has declined significantly and the states policy landscape has failed to keep up with emerging challenges, as Part 2 in this series will describe. Yet, while the future is uncertain, some progress continues. In 2017, the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court reinforced the central importance of Article 1, Section 27 and found that the Commonwealth must explicitly follow its explicit principles to, among other environmental rights, provide pure water.</p>

Protect Clean Water in the Keystone State,6/21/2017,"<p>We all depend on clean water. From communities in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that rely on public drinking water sources, to the 1.1 million anglers who cast their lines into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s streams each year, to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s craft brewers and paddlers exploring the Susquehanna, water is life.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>But the programs and policies that keep our waters clean to drink, fish, and swim are currently under attack by attempts to scale back and underfund them.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://protectcleanwater.org/""><strong>The Clean Water for All Campaign</strong></a> unites clean water stakeholders to defend and strengthen protections and funding for clean drinking water and healthy waterways in the United States. A key focus of our efforts is defending federal and state Clean Water Act-related programs that safeguard our nation&rsquo;s water.</p>

<p>Just in time for summer, the Trump Administration has taken several actions that threaten Pennsylvania&rsquo;s renowned trout streams, wetlands, and drinking water. The Administration has proposed deep cuts to critical Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Agriculture water programs that keep our water safe, and set in motion a process to roll back the very scope of the Clean Water Act itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, with its 86,000 stream miles and Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, and Delaware Basin watersheds, is uniquely situated to gain a multitude of clean water benefits from EPA programs and grants. Unfortunately, this means it has much to lose from the President&rsquo;s proposed fiscal year 2018 budget. The proposal eliminates regional ecosystem restoration programs that help states coordinate efforts to reduce pollution, restore fish and wildlife habitat, and safeguard drinking water in watersheds that cross state boundaries. This means that Pennsylvania would no longer receive federal funding via the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/great-lakes-funding/great-lakes-restoration-initiative-glri"">Great Lakes Restoration Initiative</a> and the <a href=""http://www.chesapeakebay.net/about"">Chesapeake Bay Program</a>, threatening ongoing efforts to improve the health of these watersheds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania also receives EPA funding to help support water monitoring, assessment, and management through Clean Water Act <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/water-pollution-control-section-106-grants"">Section 106 grants</a>. In Pennsylvania, this program helps improve water quality in the Delaware River, Ohio River, Susquehanna River, and Potomac River and their many tributaries. Although federal investment is crucial to help Pennsylvania maintain water quality in the rivers and tributaries that provide the state&rsquo;s drinking water, the budget blueprint proposes to cut this program by one-third.</p>

<p>The budget also eliminates funding for state efforts to control and prevent nonpoint source pollution like agriculture runoff. In 2016, the EPA provided Pennsylvania with roughly $4.6 million for this through Clean Water Act <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/nps/319-grant-program-states-and-territories"">Section 319 grants.</a></p>

<p>Another target are Pennsylvania&rsquo;s small rural communities. The budget eliminates <a href=""https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/water-waste-disposal-loan-grant-program"">USDA&rsquo;s Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program</a>, which helps improve and maintain drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in rural areas. It also cuts the <a href=""https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/financial/eqip/"">Environmental Quality Incentives Program</a>, a USDA initiative that provides assistance to agricultural producers to develop and implement conservation practices on their farms.</p>

<p>We all know that water doesn&rsquo;t respect state boundaries, so without this federal investment it will be much more difficult for states to coordinate clean-up initiatives and it would cripple Pennsylvania&rsquo;s on-going and future efforts to protect its own waters from pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has taken the first of two steps to <a href=""http://blog.nwf.org/2017/03/we-all-live-downstream/"">roll back Clean Water Act protections</a> for small streams and wetlands in Pennsylvania and nationwide. The Administration&rsquo;s first step is to repeal the widely-supported Clean Water Rule and replace it with a definition of &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; that dramatically rolls back the historic scope of the Clean Water Act.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Education-Advocacy/Clean-Water-Rule_Factsheet_17-02_FINAL.ashx"">The 2015 Clean Water Rule</a> helps safeguard small streams and wetlands that flow downstream into larger, iconic waters like the Susquehanna. It restores Clean Water Act protections to headwater, rain-fed, and seasonal streams that serve as drinking water sources for nearly 2 in every 3 Pennsylvanians. It protects thousands of acres of wetlands that provide essential fish and wildlife habitat, including streams where Pennsylvania&rsquo;s native brook trout naturally reproduce, supporting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s $700 million freshwater fishing industry. Repealing this common-sense rule could put at least 59% of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s stream miles at greater risk from pollution and destruction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step two of this attack is replacing the Clean Water Rule with a new rule that would remove protections from waters that have been protected by the Clean Water Act for more than 40 years, relying on a legal test that the majority of the Supreme Court rejected. This rollback threatens clean water interests throughout Pennsylvania. The Administration&rsquo;s rollback plan provides very little opportunity for public input and contradicts the law and science that is the basis of the Clean Water Act successes since its inception. It also ignores the extensive public record in support of the Clean Water Rule; during the rulemaking process, EPA received more than a million public comments on the rule, 87% of which were supportive.</p>

<p>Whether for drinking, swimming, fishing, paddling, or brewing, we all need clean water. Tell EPA Administrator Pruitt and your members of Congress that you expect them to invest in clean water initiatives and defend the Clean Water Act. Please urge the Administration to withdraw its Clean Water rollback plan. If the Administration considers any potential revisions to the 2015 Clean Water Rule, they must engage in a thoughtful, inclusive, science-based, and legally sound process.</p>

Planning Ahead for Continued Restoration of Mine-Impacted Waters,6/20/2017,"<p>A hearing held on June 7 in Washington, D.C. provided an important reminder that protecting and restoring water resources often requires a long-term perspective, one that, in this instance, counsels for immediate action to ensure resources will continue to be available to address widespread and long-lasting sources of water pollution. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The hearing before the House Natural Resources Committee&rsquo;s Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources addressed the federal Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program, which includes an AML Fund from which grants are distributed annually to states and tribes for reclaiming old abandoned coal mines.</strong> One issue addressed during the hearing was reauthorizing collection of the reclamation fee on each ton of extracted coal that supplies revenue to the federal AML Fund. Collection of the reclamation fee currently is scheduled to expire in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The witnesses at the hearing included R. John Dawes, the Executive Director of the Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds and a former member of PennFuture&rsquo;s board of directors. </strong>Dawes was deeply involved in the negotiations resulting in the 2006 legislation that reauthorized collection of the reclamation fee through 2021. That work earned him a share of the Pennsylvania Abandoned Mine Reclamation Conference&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mayfly Award&rdquo; in 2007. Just last month, the Pennsylvania Environmental Council bestowed a Lifetime Achievement Award on Dawes in recognition of his decades of promoting mine drainage treatment and other watershed restoration projects. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For someone like Dawes, who regularly deals with perpetual discharges of mine drainage, a long-term perspective is second nature, and the work is never done. In the long view, 2021 is just around the corner, and it is high time to address what comes after &ndash; thus Dawes&rsquo;s trip to Capitol Hill earlier this month.</p>

<p><strong>The AML Fund is critical to restoring lands and waters in Pennsylvania that have been scarred by coal mining.</strong> Our state has received more than $1.2 billion in AML Fund grants since 1980, but estimates are that we will need more than $1 billion more just to reclaim those features that threaten public health and safety, such as cliff-like highwalls and barren, mountainous refuse piles. That restoration work often improves water quality by reducing or eliminating sources of silt and mine drainage that contaminate area streams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not all discharges of mine drainage, however, can be eliminated by reclaiming abandoned mine lands. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s past mining has left many abandoned discharges that require perpetual treatment to prevent continued pollution of our streams. Fortunately, a portion of each state&rsquo;s annual AML Fund grant may be used to treat these perpetual discharges. The Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has been at the forefront in using AML Funds to treat mine drainage discharges, setting aside $131 million from its annual AML Fund grants for that purpose since 1992.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nevertheless, abandoned mine drainage remains a predominant water pollution problem in Pennsylvania.</strong> It accounts for the impairment of about 5,600 miles of Pennsylvania streams, second only to agriculture among streams with an identified source of impairment. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Effectively restoring these impaired waters depends in part on the continued availability of money from the AML Fund, which often can be leveraged by matching it with grants from other government and private sources. The continued availability of the AML Fund, in turn, depends on extending the authorization to collect the reclamation fee past the current sunset date of 2021. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In his testimony to the subcommittee, Dawes recommended that Congress reauthorize the collection of the fee for another 15 years, through 2036, while maintaining certain important features of the AML program and making improvements to others.</p>

<p>Dawes also stressed the need for Congress to act as soon as possible. The long-term planning that is essential for effective land reclamation and mine drainage treatment projects is inhibited by uncertainty over the future availability of reclamation funding. The protracted negotiations over the last reauthorization created precisely this uncertainty. To avoid repeating that scenario, and to demonstrate a commitment to helping the communities hit hardest by the downturn in the coal mining industry, Dawes urged Congress to act well in advance of the 2021 sunset date: &ldquo;Congress needs to act now, and hopefully before the end of this Congress to reauthorize the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund fee collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture echoes this call for Congress to act now. </strong>Securing reauthorization of the AML Fund&rsquo;s reclamation fee is an essential component of any strategy for restoring and removing more streams from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s list of impaired waters. More generally, reauthorization of the reclamation fee is critical for revitalizing the communities that suffer the burdens of the landscapes and waters scarred by past mining practices. The nation as a whole benefitted from winning the world wars and the industrial and energy production fueled by the coal extracted from those now-abandoned mines, so it is appropriate for the nation to now help alleviate the environmental and social costs those abandoned mines continue to impose on coalfield communities. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Reauthorization of the federal reclamation fee is one of many topics that will be addressed at the Pennsylvania Abandoned Mine Reclamation Conference June 21-22 in Wilkes-Barre.

Lead in Our Drinking Water: Cause for Concern?,6/14/2017,"<p>The story is an old one. It began long before Flint, Michigan placed it into the national spotlight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story is one of lead pipes, which have been used in plumbing for centuries. Unfortunately, this is a tale that spans across the commonwealth, from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, and that story continues through many small towns across our country today.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Health Impacts</strong></p>

<p>The science is clear; lead is a neurotoxin that impairs brain development and affects nearly every organ and system in the body. This is of particular concern for children, whose bodies absorb lead more quickly than adults. Children exposed to lead can experience behavior and learning problems, hearing complications, speech delays, anemia and kidney disease. Eighty-five percent or more of infant lead exposure that occurs during the first year of life comes from lead in water, through reconstituted formula.</p>

<p>Fetuses exposed to lead may be born early, have a low birth weight and experience negative health effects throughout their lives. Pregnant women are also especially vulnerable to lead exposure. A mother&rsquo;s past or present exposure to lead puts the unborn baby at risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stated, &ldquo;Even at half the levels previously considered safe, growing evidence shows a child&rsquo;s exposure to lead can cause irreversible cognitive and behavioral problems,&rdquo; and called for stricter regulations to protect children from lead poisoning. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Regulations</strong></p>

<p>Under the federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), water authorities are required to act when their system-wide sampling exceeds 15 ppb (parts per billion) of lead in more than 10 percent of the homes in their sampling pool. This number is not linked to any health protection standard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When municipal authorities exceed the action level, they quickly begin to offer free water testing kits. However, there is great variability with testing. A first draw sample may indicate five ppb one morning, while the next day it could indicate 50 ppb. If a resident&rsquo;s lead testing result indicates a number below 15 ppb, they should not conclude that they are &ldquo;safe&rdquo; from lead in water. The AAP urges legal requirements to ensure water fountains in schools do not exceed water lead concentrations of more than one part per billion.</p>

<p>Lead can be found in plumbing fixtures, fittings and solder. Until 2014, brass faucets advertised as lead-free could contain up to eight percent lead by weight. There is the potential of lead present all along the water&rsquo;s path, from street to faucet.</p>

<p><strong>Navigating the Path</strong></p>

<p>When local water authorities exceed the action level based on sampling, the LCR dictates that they must replace at least seven percent of the initial number of lead service lines in their distribution system annually. The LCR has created an invisible line, delineating ownership of the &ldquo;public&rdquo; side (water authority) versus the &ldquo;private&rdquo; side (homeowner) from curb to tap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Water authorities will replace their public side of the lead service line, which is referred to as a partial line replacement. The homeowner must then decide whether it is financially feasible to replace her/his &ldquo;private&rdquo; portion of the lead service line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This invisible line has nothing to do with protecting public health, which must be our first priority. Partial line replacements have been proven to increase the amount of lead exposure in drinking water. For cities that have conducted partial line replacements, the data shows this increased lead exposure may occur for days, months, and in some cases, years, due to physical and chemical disturbance.</p>

<p><strong>Local Action</strong></p>

<p>Many organizations across the commonwealth are working to address the lead in water crisis. Some are established environmental and health nonprofits, while others are community-based groups that formed in response to inaction and have led citizen-science initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have created loan programs for residents who wish to replace their lead service lines, while both cities have embarked on education and outreach programs, and both are trying to identify where the lead service lines are located. One thing is clear: this is a problem that needs short-term strategies, long-term solutions, and a vision for a healthier community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our story will be complete when prevention is the priority and science guides all decision-making.</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>

<p>What you can do to protect yourself from lead exposure in drinking water:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://apps.npr.org/find-lead-pipes-in-your-home/en/#intro""><strong>Investigate your pipes</strong></a> to determine if you have a lead service line and test your drinking water for lead by contacting your local water authority.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If testing is not available in your community, contact an accredited laboratory <a href=""http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/OtherPrograms/Labs/Pages/Laboratory-Accreditation-Program.aspx""><strong>(click here for a list)</strong></a> to request a test kit.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Filter your water with an <a href=""http://www.nsf.org/newsroom/nsf-international-publishes-consumer-guide-to-nsf-certified-water-filtratio""><strong>NSF-certified system</strong></a> (water pitcher, faucet mount, or counter top unit that connects to your faucet). Home Depot and Target carry the PUR Faucet mounts and Zero Water pitchers; both remove lead from drinking water.</li>
	<li>Use a certified filter before you use water to prepare food and infant formula.</li>
	<li>Check your water filter cartridge and change it regularly. Clean aerators in all faucets weekly by rinsing the screen.</li>
	<li>Never boil water or use hot tap water to get rid of lead. Boiling evaporates some water, increasing the concentration of lead in the water.</li>
	<li>If you are concerned about lead exposure, ask your pediatrician to have your child&rsquo;s blood lead level tested. Early intervention has proven effective and is critical if lead levels are elevated.</li>
	<li>Advocate for policy change at the local, state and federal level, such as required testing for lead in drinking water in schools and early learning centers and banning partial line replacements.&nbsp;</li>

Supreme Court to Interpret Reach of the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law,6/13/2017,"<p>The Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, enacted in 1937, is the main law designed to protect our state&rsquo;s abundant fresh water resources &ndash; from fast rushing mountain streams, to slower flowing valley rivers, to underground water that navigates through cracks and spaces between rock and soil.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Clean Streams Law sets forth the essential legal framework intended to &ldquo;preserve and improve the purity of the waters of the Commonwealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite its importance, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has issued but two decisions interpreting the liability provisions of the Clean Streams Law over the past 20 years. In 1998, the Court held in Adams Sanitation Co., Inc. v. Dept. of Envtl. Protection that the Department of Environmental Protection (Department) could, under Section 316, require an owner or lessor of land to correct pollution that existed on that land, regardless of whether the person caused or knew about the pollution. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Four years later, in Chalfont-New Britain Township Joint Sewage Authority v. Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority, the Court held that a county that allegedly contributed excess sewage to a joint treatment plant could be sued for discharging sewage indirectly into waters of the Commonwealth without a permit under Section 202 of the Clean Streams Law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s only other Clean Streams Law decisions during that time concerned the statute&rsquo;s attorney fee provisions.</p>

<p><strong>Now, the Supreme Court is about to decide its third liability case in the past 20 years. In EQT v. Department of Environmental Protection, the Supreme Court will review a Commonwealth Court decision that limited the circumstances under which the Department of Environmental Protection could impose civil penalties on companies that unlawfully discharge industrial waste into waters of the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>EQT owned and operated a gas well pad in Duncan Township, Tioga County at which it constructed an impoundment used to store contaminated wastewater from its fracking operations. Even though it was constructed with a synthetic liner, the wastewater impoundment leaked contaminated wastewater into area groundwater. &nbsp;</p>

<p>EQT eventually drained the impoundment, patched the leak, and removed contaminated soil from the site. It also took actions to intercept and collect polluted groundwater. The Department sought to impose a multi-million dollar civil penalty on EQT under Sections 301, 307 and 401 of the Clean Streams Law for contaminating the groundwater.</p>

<p>Sections 301 and 307 of the Clean Streams Law prohibit the discharge of industrial waste into waters of the Commonwealth. Section 401 makes it unlawful for any person to discharge from property owned or occupied by them &ldquo;any substance of any kind&rdquo; that results in pollution of waters of the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before Commonwealth Court, EQT argued that a violation of the Cleans Streams Law occurs only on the days when industrial waste is initially introduced into the waters of the Commonwealth, and that there is no violation for days that the pollutant, &ldquo;continues to be present.&rdquo; The Department argued that waters of the Commonwealth are made up of distinct parts &ndash; such as surface water and groundwater &ndash; and that separate violations of the law occur as the industrial waste enters and pollutes these distinct parts.</p>

<p><strong>The Commonwealth Court accepted the company&rsquo;s interpretation rather than that offered by the Department, holding that that Sections 301 and 307 are violated only when industrial waste initially enters a water of the Commonwealth. &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Court also held that the release of industrial waste to the groundwater did not violate Section 401 of the Clean Streams Law, because that provision&rsquo;s prohibition on discharging &ldquo;any substance of any kind causing pollution&rdquo; was intended to cover pollutants other than the industrial waste regulated under Sections 301 and 307. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Department then appealed the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s decision to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Because of the import of the case, PennFuture filed a friend-of-the-court (or amicus brief) in support of an interpretation of the Clean Streams Law that provides the agency with broad authority to impose substantial penalties when a company engages in conduct that causes widespread pollution to waters of the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The submission of briefs is expected to conclude this summer. The Supreme Court will then schedule oral argument in the case, after which it will render a decision. There is, however, no deadline by which a decision must be issued.</p>

Protecting the Mighty Susquehanna,6/7/2017,"<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-June-Water-is-Life-Month-at-PennFuture""><strong><em>Water is Life Month</em></strong></a> is the perfect theme for reminding ourselves that all Pennsylvanians are guaranteed a right to clean water by Article 1, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Most importantly, it is the duty of the three branches of our Commonwealth government to conserve the quality and maintain the quantity of our water for the benefit of all people, including generations yet to come.<br />
. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>&ldquo;In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed and the first of that which comes - so with present time.&rdquo; &mdash; Leonardo da Vinci (1452 &ndash; 1519).</em></strong></p>

<p>&quot;Susquehanna&quot; comes from the Len&#39;api Indian term meaning, &quot;Oyster River.&quot; Oyster beds were widespread in the bay near the mouth of the river, where it entered the Chesapeake Bay. At 464 miles long, it is the longest river on the American east coast that drains into the Atlantic Ocean, and is the 16th-largest river in the United States. &nbsp;The Susquehanna River is one of the oldest existing rivers in the world, being dated as 320-340 Mya, older than the mountain ridges which it dissects.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>&quot;A river is more than an amenity&mdash;it is a treasure that offers a necessity of life that must be rationed among those who have the power over it.&rdquo; &mdash; Oliver Wendell Holmes (1841 &ndash; 1935), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, speaking about the Delaware River in 1931.</strong></em></p>

<p>The PA Fish Commission was created in 1866 to solve the problems caused by dams blocking the free migration of American shad in the Susquehanna River, and water pollution from logging filling our streams and rivers with sediment.&nbsp;In 1867, the first fishway was constructed at the Columbia (Wrightsville) Dam (built in 1840) as the first attempt to restore anadromous fish runs to the Susquehanna. Then, along came the York Haven (1904), Holtwood (1910), Conowingo (1929), and Safe Harbor (1931) hydroelectric dams, which continue to be major impediments to migratory fish since they were built. Unfortunately, not much progress has been made in restoring migratory shad runs to most eastern rivers, but PFBC staff remain committed to achieving the migratory fish restoration goals of two million American shad and five million river herring spawning upstream of the York Haven Dam.</p>

<p><em><strong>&ldquo;We abuse land because we view it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect.&rdquo; &mdash; Aldo Leopold (1887 -1948), A Sand County Almanac.</strong></em></p>

<p>Lesions and sores caused by bacterial infections appeared on young-of-year (YOY) smallmouth bass collected from the Susquehanna River in 2005. The disease symptoms produced a massive fish kill that still affects the fishery today. The average catch rate of adult smallmouth bass is only 20 percent of what it was prior to 2005. YOY smallmouth bass catch rates are 1/3 of what they were prior to 2002. Adult bass have been found with cancerous tumors, open sores, and lesions. Black spots that aren&rsquo;t totally understood (blotchy bass syndrome), as well as high rates of intersex conditions (male bass with egg precursors and hormones, which should be found only in female bass) caused by exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) now occur. These chemicals are coming from sewage treatment plant outfalls and other sources. Unprecedented algae blooms fueled by excessive dissolved phosphorus, along with low dissolved oxygen and high pH conditions, are all factors in this complicated problem.</p>

<p><em><strong>&quot;Water is the most critical resource issue of our lifetime and our children&#39;s lifetime. The health of our waters is the principal measure of how we live on the land.&quot;&nbsp;&mdash; Luna Leopold (1915 &ndash; 2006).</strong></em></p>

<p>I have published a number of <a href=""http://www.fishandboat.com/Zone1/Pages/StraightTalk.aspx""><strong>Straight Talk articles in the Pennsylvania Angler and Boater magazine</strong></a>&nbsp;discussing the reasons why we need to begin taking action now before it is too late. Beginning with The Last Bass and Through the Eyes of a Child (2012), to S.O.S. (2015), Fear of the Known (2016) and The Precautionary Principle (2017), I discuss the ecological impacts of nutrients, EDCs and herbicides coming off of our land. Despite some moderate improvements to bass populations from several successful spawns, I continue to advocate the urgent need to create a plan (Total Maximum Daily Load) for the Susquehanna at the watershed scale, much like we have for the Chesapeake Bay, Lake Erie and other waters across our country.&nbsp;Why? Because our bass and oysters are depending on it, our anglers expect it, and Article 1 Section 27 of our Pennsylvania Constitution requires it.</p>

<p><em><strong>&ldquo;In an age when man has forgotten his origins and is blind even to his most essential needs for survival, water along with other resources has become the victim of his indifference.&rdquo;&mdash; Rachel Carson (1907 &ndash; 1964)</strong></em></p>

Water is Life: Celebrating Chesapeake Bay Week,6/6/2017,"<p><em><strong>This blog is one in a series of posts during PennFuture&#39;s Water is Life Month, which explores Pennsylvania&#39;s water crisis.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p>Monday marked the beginning of Chesapeake Bay Awareness Week, and in Pennsylvania, we celebrate and reflect on the critical health and importance of our local streams, creeks, and rivers, and the important role they each play in our lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that the health of the Chesapeake Bay is making modest improvements, but it&rsquo;s Pennsylvania&rsquo;s turn to dig-in and show everyone how essential our water is to our everyday lives and why the diminishment we are seeing in local water quality cannot continue to worsen. The situation continues to be challenging, and stakes are high. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We need to turn our focus to making healthy again the Chiques, the Conewago, the Conestoga, the Little Juniata, the Buffalo, and the Conococheague. We need to stand strong in preserving our natural heritage through angling and outdoor recreation enjoyed at Beech Creek, the Falling Spring, and the Yellow Breeches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From drinking clean water in Harrisburg and Wilkes-Barre, to using clean water for agriculture in Lancaster County, to swimming in a watering hole in Franklin County, to paddling through the West Branch Susquehanna and our headwaters communities in the Wilds &ndash; Pennsylvanians know that protecting and restoring our water is essential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This year brings an elevated purpose and role for clean water advocates and those who work in conserving our Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters. As a part of the Total Maximum Daily Load &ndash;the &ldquo;pollution diet&rdquo; -- set forth by the federal government in 2010 to improve water quality in Chesapeake Bay, 2017 brings the midpoint assessment to see where Pennsylvania is in meeting its pollution reduction goals by 2025 in sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous. Pennsylvania has missed its pollution reduction targets. We have decreased phosphorus pollution somewhat, but are missing nitrogen reduction significantly, putting the water we drink at risk throughout the basin, subjecting it to increased likelihood of algal blooms and other consequences. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the next 18 months, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Department of Agriculture are working in tandem to write the next in the series of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s goal documents in reaching its pollution reduction goals &ndash; the Watershed Implementation Plans, or WIPs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Key agencies including the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and EPA&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Program are making strides in capturing monitoring data and collecting new information on our watersheds, with help from integral partnerships with colleges and universities, nongovernmental organizations, and local watershed associations. It takes a strong and well-oiled team to do this work. While Pennsylvania is far off-target for its 2025 goals, we can be heartened by new energy by stakeholders working on the third phase of the state&rsquo;s Watershed Implementation Plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now more than ever, it is of paramount importance that our partners in recreation, sustainable agriculture, faith communities, education, and environmental conservation stand together and hold fast for the stewardship of our land and waters. We must remain engaged and push for more citizen stakeholders and advocates to remind our agencies about the severity of our clean water crisis in Pennsylvania and the need to uphold strong clean-up commitments.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>One way everyday Pennsylvanians can help this effort is to <a href=""http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol47/47-22/936.html"">submit public comments</a> to help develop the state plan to improve local water health in Chesapeake Bay Watershed counties until July 7.</strong> Citizens, farmers, paddlers, and advocates of all kinds are encouraged to lean in and tell DEP specifically how their lives revolve around water and how crucial clean water is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the path forward to clean water in Pennsylvania doesn&rsquo;t stop with having good plans in place. Long-needed dedicated clean water funding legislation has been difficult to establish in our General Assembly and State Senate, though the Commonwealth is charged as a trustee of our water resources, and clean water is a guaranteed&nbsp;right under our state constitution. <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-State-Budget-Negotiations-are-Poison-Pill-for-PAs-Environment""><strong>Governor Wolf&rsquo;s budget continues the status quo.</strong></a> Even more alarming, $73 million in funding at the federal level through the EPA&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Program remain threatened due to President Trump&rsquo;s proposed FY18 budget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Valuable conservation dollars spent for agricultural best management practice implementation by local &nbsp;farmers are paying off. This federal funding will be cut, or totally eliminated, as will &nbsp;money that flows to PA counties for conservation district staffs to work on water quality improvement, stewardship, and restoration projects. Work to establish forested riparian buffers and green infrastructure in our urban areas will suffer. Technical assistance to municipalities for stormwater requirement compliance to protect our waterways from run-off is also at stake. As Penn State found late last year, Pennsylvania needs about $300 million annually to meet its pollution reduction goals and to clean up its streams, creeks, and rivers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This challenge may seem formidable, but PennFuture is working hard to defend clean water policy and funding, and working with the legislature and Governor to sufficiently fund clean water. As the state lead organization for the <a href=""http://www.choosecleanwater.org""><strong>Choose Clean Water Coalition</strong></a>, we are busy coordinating with partners and working with legislators in Harrisburg to pass newly introduced Growing Greener III legislation, a water usage fee to raise money for watershed restoration from waterway withdrawals, and a suite of legislation to support sustainable agriculture and a cut-back on nutrients, including Representative Mike Sturla&rsquo;s Clean and Green bill, in addition to a bill that would reduce nitrogen and phosphorous in homeowner&rsquo;s fertilizer bags. We have ramped up our outreach to partners in agriculture and are asking the tough questions. At the federal level, we are regularly advocating with Pennsylvania&rsquo;s congressional delegation for more conservation funding through upcoming infrastructure spending, the 2018 Farm Bill, the Chesapeake Bay Program, and pass-through and stewardship project grants from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. <strong>We believe in clean water policy and that water is a human right for all.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The importance of state and federal funding for clean water cannot be emphasized enough. Pennsylvania needs strong support from Washington, but it is past time the state legislature move on legislation that enacts a dedicated fund for clean water.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>We at PennFuture remain vigilant and steadfast in our support for clean water funding and conservation practices, but we need your help. <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/take-action""><strong>Join our mailing list</strong></a>, participate in action alerts by contacting your legislators at critical times, and join this fight.

Meet the Donor: Gail K. Neustadt,5/25/2017,"<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/Gailweb%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 221px; height: 330px;"" /></p>

<p>Do you ever get the feeling that someone is tapping on your shoulder, giving you that sense of urgency that there&rsquo;s something more you have to do? You turn around. There&rsquo;s no one there.&nbsp;But you felt that touch.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like a wake-up call. Gail K. Neustadt, author, speech therapist, longtime PennFuture supporter and member of PennFuture&rsquo;s newly formed President&rsquo;s Leadership Council, insists we have done that to her!&nbsp;</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t know it then, but when she was growing up as a young girl on the west side of Cleveland near Lake Erie, Gail was already taking steps towards her future role in helping to preserve and protect Mother Earth. Gail loved to garden with her dad, and along with her two other siblings, took hikes in Metro Park. Her father was very adventurous, a former Eagle scout and guide, paratrooper and decorated WWII Major who&rsquo;d been awarded both a Purple Heart and Silver Star. Her mother was a community leader active in many women&rsquo;s organizations. She says both her parents were strong, positive influences, teaching her to, &ldquo;love and respect both nature and animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked her about the first time she became aware of environmental issues, and she told me that it started when she was about 5 years old. As her mom pulled into a gas station and asked the attendant to fill up the tank, Gail asked her mom about fuel. Her mother explained that gas allowed the car to move, explaining that it is food for the vehicle. Gail then asked her mother, &ldquo;Where does it come from?&rdquo; to which she answered, &ldquo;The ground.&rdquo; Since then, Gail has always looked to the earth as Mother Earth&mdash;&ldquo;everybody&rsquo;s mother from whence everything came.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As she grew up, she remembers the scents and odors in her community due to pollution. Lake Erie was an absolute mess. She would be overwhelmed by the smell of rotten eggs and ask her mother about it, who would tell her: &ldquo;You are smelling the industrialization of the Flats along the Cuyahoga River.&rdquo; Gail&rsquo;s father always wanted his children to learn more. There were tours for the River and Lake Erie so they could see firsthand what was happening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>College opened Gail&rsquo;s eyes to many social justice issues, and she actually took classes with renowned child expert, Dr. Benjamin Spock. At the University of Wisconsin , everyone was very involved in the anti-war movement and she remembers that her rabbi marched with Martin Luther King. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Later, when she was married and starting her family, she and her husband moved to Upper St. Clair. She particularly remembers Cook School Road, where there were so many farms with blackberry bushes and wildflowers.&nbsp;She and her children would take walks, enjoying the lush scenery, picking blackberries for pie. But before long, she saw that the farms were being sold off so developers could build large homes.</p>

<p>As the big earth movers and trucks came in to clear the land to build those homes, Gail witnessed the diesel engine emissions hurting the fragile blackberry bushes, the cornflowers and other wildflowers. In her mind, the diesel trucks were the enemy as she loved the flowers and felt a kinship with them. &nbsp;She also noticed &nbsp;a similar scent&mdash;that awful choking smell that she smelled as a kid that made her nauseous. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look what these emissions are doing to the poor flowers.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What brought her to Presto?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Gail moved to Presto 15 years ago to accommodate her husband&rsquo;s illness. She created a very involved garden for him and during this time, she was a speech therapist and had a qualified nursing home administrative license. Gail worked on a multi-state casements project that established the current payment and assurance programs -still used in Medicare now.&nbsp;After her husband David was diagnosed with Alzheimers, Gail began to feel that what was happening to him, along with the rise of so many diseases, like autism, allergies, and heart conditions, were connected. Our environment was being polluted, as were we. She began writing her children&rsquo;s book, Sebastian&rsquo;s Tale, in which the hero is a skunk leading other animals against the land developers who are hurting the earth. Those developers and their machinery needed more energy and gas to build their McMansions, all the while destroying wildlife and their habitats.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Nine years ago, PennFuture was involved in a large convention at the Nittany Lion Inn at Penn State University to educate the public about the Marcellus Shale. Nearly1,000 people attended, from politicians, to hunters and fisherman, to average folks. Gail could not believe what could be coming to her home. &nbsp;People from Hickory (the first area in the state to be heavily fracked) talked about how sick they were since fracking began, and they talked about the smells.&nbsp;Gail was brought back to the early days of Lake Erie and that trip to the gas station as a youngster.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In addition to writing her children&rsquo;s book and fighting fracking, Gail&nbsp;joined the board of the nearby park and the local commissioners&rsquo; advisory team, Friends of Collier Park, and helped raise money for land preservation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What made her decide to support PennFuture? &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>She says after that gathering at Penn State, she was grateful that we taught her more about energy issues; that we helped point her in the direction to learn more about ecology and what being &ldquo;green&rdquo; really means. Gail insists PennFuture was her wake up call to work hard for the environment. &nbsp;When we asked her to join the President&rsquo;s Leadership Council, she said we tapped her on her shoulder. We were her wake up call. She feels an urgent responsibility for herself, her family and her community to stand up for the preservation of our state, and our earth. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sometimes, Gail says, it&rsquo;s not easy to change people&rsquo;s minds, but keeping the conversation going is key. Her own Nevillewood Community Association is going solar.</p>

<p><strong>What does she love about PennFuture?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;The support PennFuture gives to communities under fire having difficulties, especially helping them legally, is very important. &nbsp;The information we get out and the programs we have for green efforts, plus our work to preserve our earth&mdash;pushing renewables and educating the public, is critical.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As part of the PennFuture Leadership Council, she says: &ldquo;We are expected to help inform and educate others,&rdquo; and that fits into her own goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you, Gail, for your leadership and support.&nbsp;</p>

A Climate of Conversation: Perspectives on Climate Change and Clean Energy,5/24/2017,"<p>I recently attended the &ldquo;Energy Evolution: 2017 Pittsburgh Energy Forum Series&rdquo; held at the Heinz History Center. This panel discussion was sponsored and presented by the <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> and Peoples Gas Company. I have been impressed by Morgan O&rsquo;Brian, Peoples&#39; president and CEO, as this particular gas company is seeking to have an honest dialogue about climate change and clean energy. I was also pleased that David Shribman, executive editor of the <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em>, moderated a revealing discussion called: &ldquo;A Climate of Conversation: Perspectives on Climate Change and Clean Energy.&quot;</p>

<p>The size of the public turnout was impressive and very encouraging. The conference center of the History Center was full, and the audience actively engaged with appropriate questions. Highlighting the panel was Michael Mann, Penn State University&rsquo;s distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science Center, whose now famous hockey stick warned of the impending non-linear climate change confronting the world.&nbsp;I was very pleased when Michael recently joined the board of directors of PennFuture as his knowledge and leadership will be invaluable to our cause.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The underlying issue of the evening circled around the unstated question: in the face of a non-linear climate crisis, what does sustainability really look like?</strong></p>

<p>This was an evening with divergent perspectives on the matter for sure. On one hand, Michael painted a scientifically-sound picture of the stark realities of climate change, complete with the assertion that we need an aggressive clean energy program capable of cutting carbon emissions dramatically to avoid catastrophic climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(On this point, the highly-regarded accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has been doing audits to measure progress. For the past several years, PWC has been running the numbers on climate change, and in 2014, warned that we&#39;re 20 years away from catastrophe, making it clear that we need to cut global emissions by 6.2 percent to avoid the dreaded tipping point of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, the solutions were thin to non-existent. The stark contrast between the alarming threat of fast-approaching climate disruption and the profound lack of action could not be starker. While claiming to be a green city, Pittsburgh has failed to deploy truly clean energy. Apart from a handful of corporate leaders like Levin Furniture, PittOhio, PNC Bank, and scattered pioneers like Phipps Conservatory, the community of Millvale, and a few private solar powered homes in the city, we are lagging far behind what we need to be doing to avoid climate calamity. The black and gold city needs to be installing clean energy and cutting its carbon emissions by 6.2 percent per year and not just talking about being a green city.</p>

<p>I was particularly troubled by what one of the panelists, Ron Gdovic, CEO of WindStax Wind Power Systems, said about the solar industry. His lack of knowledge about concentrated solar and battery options were concerning. For reasons that escaped me, Gdovic took a shot at the solar industry, that has been experiencing massive growth around the world, but not in Pittsburgh and certainly not on Wall Street. In the clean energy mix of the future, there is room for solar, wind and for WindStax. The clean energy community needs to be united and not divisive. The fossil fuel industry would love to divide and conquer. Fortunately, the discussion turned back to Michael to conclude with his assessment of the future.</p>

<p>Whether we listened or not, Michael warned that there is much more change coming our way as we overrun numerous planetary boundaries. As Michael suggested, the Arctic deterioration is happening many years earlier than the IPCC scientists predicted, and sea-level predictions have been revised upward from the latest IPCC report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(The Arctic is in massive positive feedback mode as the tundra is a net carbon producer now.&nbsp;The once frozen methane clathrates are releasing their potent greenhouse gases and the open waters of the Arctic are absorbing energy and feeding heat-trapping cloud formation. As the oceans warm, thermal expansion swells sea-level predictions. Greenland lost one trillion tons of ice in the past four years, and Antarctica is readying to shed an ice sheet the size of Delaware.)</p>

<p>Much remains to be done in Western Pennsylvania, but this was a good start to daylight the extraordinarily challenging days ahead. We need to listen to our top scientists like Michael Mann.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope this gathering can be a turning point. The <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> needs to dig deeper into the climate crisis to help its readers understand the enormous threat we face, and journalists must be unleashed to investigate the over-investments in the gas infrastructure by politicians.&nbsp;</p>

The State Budget Negotiations are Poison Pill for PA’s Environment,5/22/2017,"<p>Over the last 10 years, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s state budget has consistently put the environment and public health at risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deep budget cuts and sneaky policy provisions have undermined the Commonwealth&rsquo;s ability to keep drinking water safe, hold polluters accountable, and provide a clean and healthy environment for all. The FY2017-18 budget negotiations look to make this bad situation even worse.</p>

<p>While the media and general public focus on top-line items, such as education funding, total government spending, debts, and deficits, the budget determines how much or how little investment goes into environmental protection. <a href=""http://www.pennlive.com/news/2017/03/drink_water_in_pennsylvania_tr.html""><strong>The state budget process ultimately allows legislators to determine how many inspectors the state has to oversee your drinking water.&nbsp;</strong></a></p>

<p>This process determines how often the state inspects drilling operations and determines which permits are issued for conducting industrial operations safely. It determines whether or not grants are provided to communities to support recycling, how much funding is given to maintain our state parks, and also determines which funds are given to support park and forest facilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The budget allows legislators to choose whether or not to invest in storm water buffers to keep pollution out of our streams, and in spraying to keep West Nile Virus and other insect borne diseases away from our families.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The budget process has the potential to allow the state to carve out resources that direct investment toward cleaning up the Susquehanna River and reclaiming old coal piles. It could help to protect where we fish, swim, hike, ATV, recreate, and live.</p>

<p><strong>The kicker: </strong>we depend on our elected officials to make good choices about the environment, and ultimately, it is up to them. The state budget process is one in which we could make great environmental strides by investing in public health. But it all depends on the priorities and the decisions made by Governors and legislators.</p>

<p><strong>Over 10 Years of State Budget Cuts to Environmental Protection</strong><br />
Unfortunately, for the last 10 years, governors and legislators have cut investment in environmental protection, making it increasingly difficult to provide even the most fundamental oversight.</p>

<p>From FY02-03 through FY16-17, state investment in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has been cut by 53 percent, adjusting for inflation. There has been a corresponding increase in federal grants to DEP of 14 percent, but it&rsquo;s nowhere near enough to make up for the cuts in state funds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the same time period, state investment in the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) has been cut by 24 percent, accounting for inflation. There has been a 65 percent increase in federal grants, but because the increase was starting from a very small base, the overall increase doesn&rsquo;t cover the cuts in the state share.</p>

<p>Making matters worse, both DEP and DCNR&rsquo;s budgets rely significantly on special spending accounts, separate from state appropriations, for between 30 to 70 percent of its overall budget. These funding accounts are where revenue from fees and fines are collected and directed by law to specific activities at the agency, such as oil and gas royalties from public lands, waste fees, and permitting fees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In FY2016-17, both DEP and DCNR&rsquo;s overall budget relied on these funds for 42 percent of its revenue. Yet, the revenue provided from these funds has decreased by 26 percent at DEP and 18 percent at DCNR since FY 2002-03 because the legislature has diverted those funds to other programs, or the funds haven&rsquo;t been updated in years and are accruing less and less dollars every year.</p>

<p>What does all of this mean? Pennsylvania has consistently cut state funding for protecting our air, water, and public lands, while failing to update our laws to keep agency funding accounts up-to-date. This has led to a dereliction of duty. Our state government isn&rsquo;t provided the funding and tools to fulfill its mandate to protect our environment for present and future generations.</p>

<p><strong>The FY2017-18 State Budget Aims to Make a Bad Situation Worse</strong><br />
Pennsylvania&rsquo;s ability to protect the environment is nearing a moment of crisis, yet there is little urgency to address the problem through the state budget. In fact, the Governor proposed a state budget that continues the status quo, while the House of Representatives has passed House Bill 218, which makes environmental funding remarkably worse.</p>

<p>HB 218 is a disaster for DEP and DCNR. It proposes cutting DEP&rsquo;s General Operations by 10 percent, its Environmental Programs by 6.5 percent, and its Environmental Protection programs by five percent. It cuts all river basin commissions by up to 50 percent and hacks 8 percent from the Chesapeake Bay program. These cuts put DEP&rsquo;s ability to protect our water resources in a dire situation, while stressing its basic functions, like permit oversight, to a level never seen at the agency.</p>

<p>It also cuts DCNR&rsquo;s budget by $2.8 million, which would result in rolling closures of state parks, a lack of maintenance at public facilities, and the elimination of key programs that support trails, road maintenance for hunters at state forests, and programs that battle forest fires.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, PennFuture will keep a close eye on state budget negotiations and make sure that we keep you &ndash; our readers, members, and the general public &ndash; apprised of what the legislature is doing with your environmental protection agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Early indications aren&rsquo;t good and the public needs to tell their elected officials cutting DEP and DCNR is unacceptable. <a href=""http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/"">Click here to find and contact your legislator today.</a></strong></p>

How we choose to treat the environment has a direct impact on our lives, our public safety, and our health. Within President Trump&rsquo;s first 100 days, we have witnessed unprecedented attacks on&nbsp;our public health through executive orders, regulatory reform, and proposed budget cuts. The people of the United States have a right to a clean and healthy environment, and that right cannot come second to the interests of fossil fuel companies.&nbsp;I will not stand for it, and the people of Pennsylvania will not stand for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is my first large climate march, and I&rsquo;m so proud that I worked with Conservation Voters of PA to organize a busload of Pennsylvanians to join more than 200,000 people marching in Washington, D.C. These are only the first 100 days of this Administration&rsquo;s irresponsible and extremely dangerous decision-making. We will be called to defend our health, our safety, and our values as a nation.

I came for the simple reason that Donald Trump&rsquo;s policies are destroying the world I live in. Some examples include cutting funding to National Parks, wanting to open up National Monuments to drilling and mining, wanting to destroy&mdash;actually dismantle--the EPA entirely, relaxing pollution standards on coal companies, allowing them to pour poisons into streams, and on and on and on. And common sense says that&rsquo;s a kind of suicide.

Clean Energy Pittsburgh: Leading the Way,5/18/2017,"<p><em><a href=""http://pennfuture.org/News-Clean-Energy-Pittsburgh-Convenes-First-Community-Workshop"">The first ever Clean Energy Pittsburgh workshop</a> took place in Millvale, Pa. on Friday, May 12. Brittany Reno is one of the participants and a local leader who is passionate about moving her community towards clean energy. Clean Energy Pittsburgh is a PennFuture initiative funded by The Pittsburgh Foundation.</em></p>

<p>Clean energy is important to me because I represent a community that is facing substantial challenges around air quality and stormwater management, which is why I am enthusiastic to have the opportunity through PennFuture&rsquo;s Clean Energy Pittsburgh cohort to learn from the successes and challenges of similar communities at a crossroads.</p>

<p>Being nestled in a river valley between an active industrial railroad and a major highway, Sharpsburg often finds itself bearing the burdens of heavily polluted air and overwhelming stormwater flooding, and we&rsquo;re at a critical point where it&rsquo;s dangerous and impossible to continue ignoring the huge impact that we&rsquo;re having on our environment&mdash;and vice versa.</p>

<p>I represent Sharpsburg as both a borough council member and as the executive director of Sharpsburg Neighborhood Organization, a resident-driven community development nonprofit. In both of these roles, I advocate for community-supported local improvements that make the borough a safer and healthier place to live. It&rsquo;s especially important to me to advocate on behalf of stakeholders who aren&rsquo;t typically represented at local decision-making tables; I have found that the needs of children, people of all ages who are living in poverty, and the environment itself are generally under-represented in discussions around legislation and development.</p>

<p><strong>Clean energy and sustainable community planning are not just environmental issues; they&rsquo;re issues of public health, economic opportunity, and social equity.</strong> When the air breathed by people in low-income communities is filled with cancer-causing soot particulates, and those same people must bankrupt their families and futures to finance health care treatments to deal with these problems, it&rsquo;s clear that the issue of clean energy is a life or death matter, not a niche environmentalist issue.</p>

<p>My biggest takeaway from the first Clean Energy Pittsburgh workshop is that it&rsquo;s not enough to stand by and wait patiently for federal or state lawmakers to lead the way on saving our planet. In a time when big-money corporate interests have a stranglehold on our political process, I&rsquo;m convinced that the drive for widespread investment in clean energy will be most effective as a grassroots movement, an entire nation of small towns like mine filled with normal people like me rising up and demanding that we as a society do better for our children and grandchildren by doing what&rsquo;s in our power to protect and repair the environment. Our representatives need to start legislating based on the health and safety of the people and the environment, not the profits and bonuses of soulless, lungless corporations.</p>

<p><strong>I call on other community leaders to get involved at the local level because there is strength in numbers.</strong> Your impact as one community of 3,500 people will not save the world, but when we band together and galvanize individuals across the state and across the country to action, it sends a message that gets harder and harder to ignore at the state and federal levels. We deserve clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We should not get cancer from breathing the air around us, and our legislation should reflect that right. <strong>Your actions at the local level, multiplied in inspired towns across the country, truly do have the power to save the planet for those of us who live on it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We can win, so long as we care enough to work hard and fight fair. Let&rsquo;s get to work.</strong></p>

A Voice in Defense of Science,5/15/2017,"<p>We often take certain things for granted in life. One of those for me was the difference between personal opinions and scientifically verifiable facts. I never thought I would have to march to defend the very notion of science itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like tens of thousands of others in many cities around the world, I marched with PennFuture&rsquo;s staff and 20,000 volunteers stretching across ten blocks across Center City Philadelphia during the March for Science on April 22. During this march, we gave support to the scientists who are under fire from dark-money contrarians, climate deniers, and even the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who himself rejects climate science, and our own president who thinks that climate change is a Chinese hoax.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We started at Philadelphia City Hall, which is crowned by a statute of one of America&rsquo;s earliest noted scientists, Ben Franklin. It was appropriate that a Franklin look-alike led our march as he was not just a founding statesman, inventor, and author of &ldquo;Poor Richard&#39;s Almanack,&rdquo; but he also was one of America&rsquo;s first scientists. Among his scientific advancements, Franklin charted the powerful Gulf Stream that enabled ships sailing for Europe to double their speed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Franklin also launched the American Philosophical Society in 1743 to pursue &quot;philosophical experiments that let light into the nature of things, tend to increase the power of man over matter, and multiply the conveniences or pleasures of life.&quot; Franklin knew that the advancement of science and the application of knowledge would greatly benefit society. He also believed that curiosity and experimentation would lead to greater light into the nature of things. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In a modern social system as in Franklin&rsquo;s day, certain principles and values are inherent to the proper functioning of community. &nbsp;Since the 18th century &ldquo;Age of Enlightenment,&rdquo; science-based decision-making has been central to nearly every societal advancement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Science leads the world towards greater and greater progress, as we find new ways to tackle old problems. PennFuture shares Franklin&rsquo;s view of science, as we are an environmental organization committed to science-based advocacy for the advancement of a safe, healthy and sustainable society. We depend upon science to provide critical answers to the most vexing air and water pollution problems. Soil science properly applied yields greater productivity while retaining nutrients and sediments. Clean energy built on advancing technologies provides clean, carbon-free energy to meet the demands of a 21st century society.</p>

<p>The highly-respected astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said it best: &ldquo;The good thing about science is that it&#39;s true whether or not you believe in it.&rdquo; Whether policymakers believe in science or not is irrelevant, facts are stubborn and cannot be just legislated away. Should society irrationally abandon authoritative science and turn once again to superstitions and myths, then we will certainly drift into the tyranny that created the Dark Ages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon hearing that President Trump wants to cut climate science funding and dismantle EPA&rsquo;s science advisory group, the newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron says France wants our top climate and clean-tech researchers to move to his country, where they will be understood and respected. &nbsp;The French president knows that science and innovation will underpin the winning nations in the future as it has in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can we afford to lose our scientific edge and just ignore or discount the warnings of climate scientists? Can we simply publish textbooks that avoid objectionable scientific conclusions and pejoratively label innovators and leading thinkers as &ldquo;coastal elites?&rdquo; When a highly vocal chorus of ill-informed voters repeatedly reject basic truths and pursue myths and alternative facts concocted by those who obfuscate, we must ask, perhaps are we a society encountering the very boundaries of human enlightenment? I, for one, certainly hope not, but that is no longer a given.</p>

<p>Franklin was a strong proponent of &quot;enlightened&quot; rationality &ndash; and we agree. Please help PennFuture carry the banner of enlightenment to confront the myths and disinformation that is causing so many to stumble and threatening the very inhabitability of much of our planet.</p>

First Person: My Experience at the Harrisburg March,5/11/2017,"<p>On the date marking President Trump&rsquo;s first 100 days in office, PennFuture staff and members joined colleagues from&nbsp;Sierra Club - Pennsylvania Chapter and the Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg by marching for clean air, pure water, and a healthy climate. The president observed his first 100 days in office with a rally in our city, and we wanted to make it clear that climate change is real and it is an issue that must be addressed.</p>

<p>It was a warm and humid day, much like any summer day in Pennsylvania, but overcast, and our city was electric with anticipation. People from across the state and country descended upon the Capital City.</p>

<p>Upon learning that President Trump and Vice President Pence would be speaking at a rally at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex to tout victories and accomplishments of the administration, our environmental community banded together with other statewide and local community organizations in Harrisburg to stand up against the President&rsquo;s dangerous and damaging environmental policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While more than 200,000 of our neighbors and allies marched on Washington, D.C. during the People&rsquo;s Climate March, held on the same day, we decided to make a statement to President Trump that he could not take shelter in the Keystone State from listening to our voices and our earth. We aimed to bring the energy of the People&rsquo;s Climate March to Harrisburg and remind President Trump of his obligation to lead on environmental issues.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/ezramarch%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 533px;"" /></p>

<p>During his first 100 days in office, President Trump dismantled hard-won climate protections, issued assaults on our air, water, and land, directly attacked the well-being of working families, and marginalized Indigenous communities, people of color, immigrants, the LGBTQIA community, women, young people, and low-income communities. Further, the President&rsquo;s policies have attacked national monuments and the Endangered Species Act, and put at risk key funding for our farmers and watermen through the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.</p>

<p>By any and all measurements, the first 100 days of the Trump Administration and the Scott Pruitt-led Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have completely failed when it comes to protecting our health and environment. In fact, virtually all of Trump&rsquo;s environmental actions have put public health at greater risk, exposing us to dangerous pollution from power plants, cars and other sources, and toxic chemicals in our water and pesticides on food kids like to eat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Trump and EPA Administrator Pruitt have also failed to push clean energy and the jobs that come with it. Their unprecedented actions that jeopardize the safety of Americans are squarely at odds with what, in poll after poll, the American people want: clean air and safe water, clean energy, action on climate, and for their government to hold polluters accountable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically in Pennsylvania, farmers&rsquo; crops are being hurt by the changing climate, outdoorsmen are encountering diseased game, fishermen are finding sick bass, public drinking water in a number of municipalities face lead contamination, and our cities are experiencing flooding and stormwater problems at new, out of control levels.<br />
We gathered around in the early evening among the state&rsquo;s towering administrative buildings to speak truth to power. After listening to uplifting speeches from friends, nearly 500 citizens marched up 7th Street to Maclay Street before moving over to Cameron Street by the Farm Show Complex. It was a beautiful evening as the sun set and we were met with the community support of honking cars and cheers as we passed by the different city neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Vice President Pence left the event, we made sure to share our signs and chants with him, and we did the same as President Trump&rsquo;s motorcade left the location and pulled onto Cameron Street back to Washington. The evening put over six miles of trekking on the marchers, but seeds were planted, and an overwhelming spark of empowerment in our fellow marchers was evident. It resonated long after the night concluded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We marched, because all Pennsylvanians deserve a voice. All Pennsylvanians, no matter their station, have a right to clean air, pure water, and the preservation of our environment. It is the duty of the Commonwealth to serve as trustee of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s precious resources for not just the rich, and not just the powerful, but for all. We must continue to advocate for conservation and our environment. <strong>We must continue to show up and share our stories, not only by marching in the streets, but by continuing our work in the halls of the State Capitol and in Washington.</strong></p>

Who will finally take action on PA’s worsening oil and gas air pollution problem?,5/4/2017,"<p><strong>(UPDATE: Our original data, obtained through a Right to Know request,&nbsp;showed a 20 percent year-over-year increase in methane emissions between 2014 and 2015. As of May 24, 2017 the PA DEP has released their reports and are now showing a 28 percent&nbsp;increase year over year.)</strong></p>

<p>Every year since 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has asked drillers and owners of compressor stations to report the amount of air pollution they emit. We saw a dip in emissions of methane&mdash;the primary constituent of natural gas&mdash;in 2013 as a new set of regulations, the federal New Source Performance Standards, began to phase in, but emissions are once again on the rise.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/NG_PROD_SUM_A_EPG0_FGS_MMCF_A.htm"">Data from the Energy Information Agency (EIA)</a> shows that natural gas production from such wells in Pennsylvania increased by more than 12 percent between 2014 and 2015. But the most recent inventory data shows that between 2014 and 2015, methane emissions rose more than 20 percent&mdash;an alarming increase. <strong>Any time emissions are rising faster than production, it&rsquo;s clear that voluntary efforts to cut emissions are not working.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is the industry emitting more now, or was it inappropriately under-reporting emissions in previous years?&nbsp;</strong>While both may be true, new reporting alone doesn&rsquo;t seem to be enough to explain the large jump in emissions. These inventories are industry&rsquo;s self-reported data, and as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has previously noted, actual emissions could be considerably higher than what is being reported. <a href=""http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2017/February/methane-increases-in-Marcellus-Shale/"">Recent studies in Pennsylvania have shown our local methane concentrations are increasing much faster than the global average.</a></p>

<p>Back in 2012, the largest source of methane emissions industry reported was well completions, or the process of readying a well for production. At the time, it was common practice to vent gas straight to the atmosphere. Thanks to new federal standards, operators must now capture that gas. As a result, well completion emissions dropped over 90 percent between 2012 and 2014 and that by itself explained a dip in total emissions. These sensible standards &nbsp;kept thousands of tons of methane from being emitted each year, but these emissions are now rising again as drilling increases.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/Files/Admin/graphicmethane%2Ejpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 386px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>One of the key lessons we can draw from the data is that rules work, and Gov. Tom Wolf has the ability to act on behalf of Pennsylvanians and their communities to effect common-sense standards.</strong> The Pennsylvania DEP has proposed a new set of general permits for the industry that would close the permit exemption for wells and add important new controls such as more frequent leak detection and repair and both wells and compressor stations. That is a good start, but those permits will only apply to new sources&mdash;not the thousands of existing sources including wells and compressor stations that are operating today. Cost-effective technologies exist that can cut emissions from these existing sources for a penny per thousand cubic feet of gas produced.</p>

<p><strong>As the Trump administration works to eliminate air quality standards, we need Gov. Wolf to honor his promise to cut harmful methane emissions at the state level for the sake of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s health and its economy.</strong> Regrettably, state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler has sponsored a bill, SB 175, that would forever tie the hands of our state and put the Washington D.C. lobby in charge of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s air. That is simply unacceptable</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania has an oil and gas air pollution problem, and it&rsquo;s getting worse. It&rsquo;s critical that our elected officials in Harrisburg take the lead on action to address the methane emissions that are harming public health and exacerbating the climate-borne chaos&mdash;floods, droughts, wildfires&mdash;we continue to experience. And since methane is the primary component of natural gas, cutting emissions means that we&rsquo;re not wasting our natural resources.</strong></p>

<p>The latest data showing a 20 percent jump in methane emissions make the need for immediate action abundantly clear.</p>

<p>She recently sat down to discuss her early introduction to nature, why she supports PennFuture, and her concerns about Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental future for the next generations.</p>

<p>Ann grew up along the banks of the Appalachian Trail in the Valley of Tocks Island in the Delaware River. &nbsp;She recounted the controversial history of the Tocks Island Dam project, which gained traction after a 1955 flood that caused several deaths, and severely damaged the Delaware River basin; how thousands of acres of land were confiscated by the government through eminent domain along the banks of the Delaware, often using not so civil tactics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Out of the anger and protests by families forced out of their farms and homes, an early environmental movement was born. Eco-activists Nancy Shukaitis, Ruth Jones and others, including a coalition from the Lenape Nation, went before Congress sharing their concerns. &nbsp;Eventually, the dam project became so delayed, it was no longer feasible.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What happened in Ann&rsquo;s backyard woke her up to a myriad of environmental issues.</strong></p>

<p>She fondly remembers her father taking the whole family out to hike the Appalachian trail, early on a Sunday morning, recruiting everyone, whether they wanted to go out or not! &nbsp;He especially loved camping and birdwatching, and introduced Ann to both at an early age.&nbsp;Since then, she has&nbsp;added fly-fishing to her list of favorite outdoor activities.</p>

<p>When asked about what changes she has noticed in her area over the years, she was quick to say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come a long way since I was a child. Then, the shad could not run up the Delaware and now they can. It&rsquo;s cleaner, so there have been some changes and huge progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that her children are grown, she has more time to be active as an environmental advocate. &ldquo;You have to work towards making improvements, especially for climate change,&rdquo; Ann said.</p>

<p>Ann discovered PennFuture around 2009 when she found out we advocated on a state and national level, as well as zeroing in on local issues, including litigating to clean up the Brodhead Watershed in her area. Ann believes we all have to address the big environmental picture. &nbsp;&ldquo;What happens globally affects us locally. You can&rsquo;t take for granted what we have here now if we don&rsquo;t take action to protect it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><strong>Why does she support PennFuture&nbsp;financially with monthly giving?</strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to donate because PennFuture is critical to address environmental issues. &nbsp;We need the steady consistent support to survive. If folks would give up their &lsquo;on the run&rsquo; coffee, beer or fast food money, and if many people did that, it all adds up and would help,&rdquo; Ann said. &ldquo;Whatever I can put towards making a difference that will help my children and grandchildren when I&rsquo;m gone, is worth it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>What does she love about PennFuture?</strong> &ldquo;PennFuture does so many things I alone cannot do to make that important difference for the next generations. &nbsp;Your leadership is incredible, especially with your timely and critical alliance with Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania. &nbsp;Organizations have to work together.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on the future?</strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to enjoy what we have, the Appalachian trail, the Poconos, fly-fishing, our parks and forests, but you have to put some time into keeping and maintaining it. Pick an organization - like PennFuture - and support them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thank you, Ann, for your support and leadership. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re lucky to have you standing with us.&nbsp;</p>

Energy Saving Act 129 in Jeopardy,4/14/2017,"<p>In 2008, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s legislature was concerned about the impacts of rising electricity prices on ratepayers and, in response, adopted the Act 129 energy efficiency program. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Under this program, the Public Utility Commission (PUC) sets targets that are both achievable and cost-effective and electric utilities develop and implement plans to reach those targets. Consumers pay for these efficiency programs through their bills, but the programs are designed to provide more benefits than they cost.</p>

<p>Through Act 129, homeowners and businesses can take advantage of LED lighting, programmable thermostats, energy efficient appliances, home energy audits, and other measures at reduced prices. Sometimes, these options can end up being free for the consumer as a result. These measures also will often lower their electricity bills for years to come.</p>

<p>In February, the independent Statewide Evaluator (SWE) released its final report on Phase II of Act 129, which was the three-year period ending in June of 2016. They found that the program returned $1.73 in benefits for every dollar spent. That is actually a very conservative number, which doesn&rsquo;t include fuel and water savings that often go hand-in-hand with electricity savings. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t include health and environmental benefits from avoided pollution, or what is known as wholesale price suppression, because most of our electricity is purchased at auction, lower demand means lower wholesale prices for everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an old saying that &ldquo;the cheapest kilowatt of electricity is the one you never use,&rdquo; but it remains true.</p>

<p><strong>In spite of being highly cost-effective, Act 129 is in jeopardy.</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s natural to expect that companies adopt the low-cost measures first, so it&rsquo;s no surprise to see a gradual decline in the benefit to cost ratio. This problem is compounded because the Act caps investment in the program to two percent of a utility&rsquo;s 2006 sales. There are plenty of cost-effective efficiency measures available, but without an adjustment for inflation, the investment in real dollars declines over time. So, while the available measures cost more, we are investing less.</p>

<p>We also have folks in the legislature attempting to further cripple the program by allowing certain large businesses to opt out. These businesses may have already taken advantage of the program, and they will continue to benefit from wholesale price suppression, but they would also like to have someone else pay for it.</p>

<p>At a time we should be investing more and not less, this would be a move in the wrong direction.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/"">Contact your state senators</a> and let them know that you support Act 129 and oppose attempts to let large industrial customers opt-out. Together, we can make a difference</strong></p>

<p>On the sandy beaches of the Delaware Bay in New Jersey, rufa red knots arrive every year from the southernmost tip of South America. What makes this federally threatened bird species remarkable is its epic journey: 19,000 miles per year, from Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic Circle and back again, one of the longest migrations in the animal kingdom. But overharvesting of horseshoe crabs by the fishing industry has put red knots in peril: when the starving birds arrive, there aren&iacute;t enough horseshoe crab eggs waiting for them. And last year, regulators approved a plan to permit a 1,400 percent increase in oyster farming which could further threaten the red knots&rsquo; survival.&nbsp;</p>

Making Clean Energy a Way of Life,3/30/2017,"<p>Piece by piece, Fred Kraybill&rsquo;s lifestyle has become fueled almost entirely by renewable, clean energy.</p>

<p>With a personal passion for fighting climate change and fighting for the environment, along with the drive to be a part of a worldwide shift away from fossil fuels, this Pittsburgh resident is an advocate for all things solar, wind and geothermal energy.</p>

<p>Switching to renewable energy isn&rsquo;t just a dream for Kraybill &ndash; it&rsquo;s a way of life he can be proud of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a gaping failure in the marketplace right now,&rdquo; Kraybill said. &ldquo;The marketplace doesn&rsquo;t recognize the difference between cheap, dirty energy, and cheap, clean energy. To me, climate change is the greatest crisis the human race has ever faced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A registered nurse and shift supervisor at the VA Medical Center, the Point Breeze resident&rsquo;s discovery of the climate change issue and the complex obstacles facing renewable energy&rsquo;s implementation began after he watched the documentary, <a href=""http://www.whokilledtheelectriccar.com/"">&ldquo;Who Killed the Electric Car?&rdquo;</a> The film tells the story about how California tried to clean its air and get off of fossil fuels by mandating a certain amount of clean energy vehicles and electric cars, which were just starting to come out at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sad thing is, the oil companies and politicians killed it in the &lsquo;90s,&rdquo; Kraybill said. &ldquo;The advocates were so passionate about electric vehicles, talked about climate change, wars for oil and why we need to move to clean energy, and that is what got me into renewable energy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He quickly became more engaged as both a renewable energy advocate and consumer. Since viewing the film, he has attended the American Wind Power Conference for the last eight years, and has remained an activist for renewable energy, electric vehicles and moving the country off of its dependence on fossil fuels. Kraybill is a member of PennFuture&rsquo;s President&#39;s Leadership Council, is a member of SUNWPA, and also is a member of PennFuture&rsquo;s Solar Tour Advisory Committee.</p>

<p>Kraybill purchased a Chevy Volt in 2011, marking his first major investment in renewable energy. Soon after, he took the steps needed to ensure that his electric car was being fueled by clean electricity, and that is when he began to transition his home to solar energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He attended a solar energy class at Home Depot before connecting with a local company at the time called Standard Solar. He worked directly with Ian Smith, who now works for <a href=""http://www.eissolar.com/"">EIS Solar</a>. The company installed solar panels on his home and in the lot next door to the building in April 2012.</p>

<p>Kraybill lives in a mansion-style home that has been converted into six apartments. The solar panels fuel the entire home and provide the power needed for his Chevy Volt.</p>

<p>In 2015, Kraybill continued to push to live a life free of fossil fuels, and added geothermal energy to the home as well. The geothermal energy runs on electric, which uses more of the solar energy produced by his solar panels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I became more and more fascinated with the idea of, &lsquo;Can we get off of fossil fuels?&rsquo; I was so far ahead already, so the next big question was, &lsquo;Can we do heating with clean energy?&rsquo; Of course, the answer is you can, but this was a much more difficult installation for geothermal. We have to have a natural gas radiator to back it up in the winter time, because geothermal cannot get the water hot enough to heat the house,&rdquo; Kraybill said.</p>

<p>Fred needs to have a natural gas furnace back up the geothermal energy in the winter time, because geothermal cannot get the water hot enough to heat the house when the temperature goes below 30 degrees. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, solar installation costs about $3.50 per watt, with an average installation involving 5,000 watts. The price continues to drop as the market becomes more and more solar-friendly. Another aspect of living with solar that makes Fred&rsquo;s lifestyle work is net metering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One interesting thing for me is that I actually overproduce a lot of electricity in the summer because I might get 200 kilowatts in addition to what I am consuming, so I am generating a lot of electricity. Because of the net metering rules, which are very important, the utility credits me for that, and allows me to carry them over month to month,&rdquo; Kraybill said.</p>

<p>For Pittsburgh residents wondering how solar energy could power a home all year, even in the darker winter months, net metering is the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beauty of it is that when I get to the winter, I am producing a lot less because there are shorter days and shading issues really start to show up as well. My production drops and my consumption increases because of geothermal, but I have banked all of this because of the electricity I produced in the summer,&rdquo; Kraybill said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A local resource that makes it easier for residents to transition to solar energy is an organization called <a href=""http://www.solarizeallegheny.org/"">Solarize Allegheny.</a> Kraybill is a member of the group, which offers solar tours and educational events. After people attend an event, all they have to do is visit the Solarize Allegheny website and sign up, and solar installers contact them directly, allowing residents to compare prices.</p>

<p>Kraybill has benefitted from his renewable energy journey on many levels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fulfilling my passion for renewable energy and action on climate change on a personal level, but I also get involved politically because that&rsquo;s where the solutions come from. I am involved in five climate action groups, and two renewable energy groups, so it fulfills a passion of mine to go solar. And it plugs me into a network of a lot of interesting people,&rdquo; Kraybill said.</p>

<p>He encourages his fellow Pennsylvania residents to consider the global issue of climate change &ndash; and to consider its significance and its threat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider the need to do something about climate change. If you have the ability to do something, and it has such a great benefit to society -- do it,&rdquo; Kraybill said.</p>

<p>Fred will attend the <a href=""https://peoplesclimate.org/"">Peoples Climate March on April 29 in Washington, D.C. </a>and he is helping to organize buses of other activists to attend. &nbsp;Every action he takes supports his own personal motto: The solution to pollution is renewable &ndash; it&rsquo;s doable.</p>

Trump’s Attack on our Environment,3/20/2017,"<p>In his first speech before Congress, President Trump pledged to &quot;promote clean air and water&quot; while he nominated Scott Pruitt to dismantle the EPA and gut vital programs across the spectrum.</p>

<p>The Trump/Pruitt budget defunds the critically important climate plan to <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Paris-Climate-Accord-Too-Little-Too-Late-or-an-Important-First-Step"">comply with the Paris agreement</a>, and they propose killing the Chesapeake Bay Program. They have already dumped the Waters of the United States Rule,&nbsp;and they are again allowing coal companies to dump waste&nbsp;into rivers and streams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are so many critical programs on Trump&rsquo;s chopping block that it&rsquo;s hard to single out an example of what is at stake with so many on the line. Perhaps, the auto efficiency rules that President Obama carried to completion are a good example.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Trump administration announced that it will roll back auto regulations and weaken the fuel economy standards that were set by President Obama&#39;s EPA, requiring cars and light trucks to get a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last month, automakers lobbied the EPA to withdraw that rule when the same CEOs stood with myself and Bob King, who was then head of the Auto Workers. All five of us were asking for these very same regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What has&nbsp;changed? The gas prices have come down as efficiency reduced demand as the auto fleet turns over. Now, the automakers want to go back to building gas guzzlers and Trump wants to give out favors like candy - and he will deregulate whether it makes sense or not.</p>

<p>These rules save consumers enormous amounts of money over the life of a fuel-efficient car, mostly at the pump, and the cost/benefit is extraordinarily positive. This rule cuts CO2 emissions from each automobile and truck by 50 percent&nbsp;by 2025 as automakers move to electric, hybrids and more efficient drivetrains, aerodynamic designs and lighter and stronger vehicles.</p>

<p>The official government data at the time the rules were adopted indicated: &quot;The benefits of the finalized Obama EPA rules are valued at $144 billion a year (all figures in 2010 dollars). Most of the benefits come from saving lives and other health benefits. They also include benefits such as substantially reduced fuel expenditures by consumers or increased worker productivity (because workers are healthier).</p>

<p>The compliance costs of the Obama EPA rules ultimately amount to about $26 billion a year. In combination, the annual costs equal only about 0.1 percent of the economy&mdash;or one-thousandth of the economy. Compliance costs of this magnitude should not be expected to dramatically influence economic growth or employment in one direction or another.</p>

<p>The net benefits from these rules total $118 billion a year. Benefits exceed costs by a ratio of 5.5 to 1.&quot;</p>

<p>Dependence on foreign oil is a destructive drag on the U.S. economy. Since 1990, nearly $5 trillion went out of the U.S. economy, moving offshore to buy oil largely from the Middle East. Continued dependence on foreign oil presents enormous national economic and security risks, fundamental moral and ethical compromises and incalculable ecological damage to the entire planet. So what does Trump do? He is proposing to eliminate the highly successful fuel efficiency standards, rewarding big oil while hurting the consuming public.</p>

<p>It is time for Congress stands up to Trump and Pruitt and just say no to these rule changes.&nbsp;</p>

The Fight for Our Air Quality: Join Us in Clairton,3/14/2017,"<p>Each morning, Clairton resident Cheryl Hurt makes her cup of coffee, watches the morning news, and checks a monitor to see how the air quality is outside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monitor indicates the results through a color spectrum; green is good and anything resembling an orange-red color is worrisome. This monitor, a product of Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s CREATE Lab, <a href=""https://www.specksensor.com"">is called Speck</a>&nbsp;and will determine if it&rsquo;s safe for the kids at her daycare center, held at her home, to go play outside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Clairton community, we don&rsquo;t see the black soot that used to be on our bedsheets and windows anymore. But unfortunately, people don&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s the fine particulate matter that is still in the air that is just as dangerous,&rdquo; Cheryl said. &ldquo;I have a responsibility to make sure the kids I watch are safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a prevalent amount of orange and red days found in Clairton and throughout the Mon Valley region, Cheryl has every right to hold this fear. According to the American Lung Association&#39;s 2016 <a href=""http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/healthy-air/state-of-the-air/sota-2016-full.pdf"">&quot;State of the Air&quot; report</a>, Allegheny County received a failing grade for year-round particle pollution.</p>

<p>The city of Clairton and surrounding municipalities like Glassport and Lincoln are particularly susceptible to poor air quality due to proximity to neighbor U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works, the largest coke works in North America and one of the biggest polluters in Allegheny County.</p>

<p>This May will mark the one-year anniversary of PennFuture providing U.S. Steel and the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) with notice of intent to file a citizen suit under the federal Clean Air Act after discovering that the coke works committed 6,700 air violations in a three-year time span.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.S. Steel and ACHD signed a consent decree that gives U.S. Steel three years to bring the facility into compliance with emissions limits.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>But can residents afford to wait another three years for cleaner air?</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t think so. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/625607137647829/"">On Sunday, March 26, PennFuture, Clean Water Action, and Clean Air Council will host the event, Breathless: An Air Quality Expo&nbsp;</a>at the Community Economic Development Community Center in Clairton from 2 p.m.- 6 p.m. This event will address and highlight the tools and resources that concerned citizens can use to combat poor air quality in their community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, there are ten Specks, just like the one Cheryl uses, that Clairton residents can borrow at the Clairton Public Library&mdash;for free.</p>

<p>This family-friendly event will have free snacks, beverages, and raffle prizes.</p>

First PA Solar Future Stakeholder Meeting a Success,3/9/2017,"<p>On Thursday, March 2, 115 stakeholders met in Harrisburg for the kick-off of <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Finding-Pennsylvanias-Solar-Future"">&ldquo;Finding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future,&rdquo;</a> a 30-month project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy to explore pathways to increasing solar generation to 10 percent of sales by 2030.</p>

<p>This target will require growing our solar generation capacity by about 30 percent per year. That is ambitious, but achievable. Nationwide, solar generation has seen 60 percent year-over-year growth for the last decade.</p>

<p>Finding our solar future not only means a cleaner and healthier environment for us and our children, leadership in clean renewable generation also means jobs for Pennsylvanians. We currently rank 22nd in the nation with a little more than 3,000 solar jobs. While this is a start, there is no reason why we can&rsquo;t be in the top ten. Massachusetts, for example, has about half of the population of Pennsylvania, but still has more than 15,000 solar jobs.</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s no surprise many of the stakeholders are solar industry professionals and clean energy advocates, it is a much more diverse group. As solar power becomes more and more affordable, both opportunities and challenges arise. This has led stakeholders representing electric utilities,&nbsp;our power grid,&nbsp;academia,&nbsp;the financial sector, federal, state, and local government, and interested citizens to coalesce around the Solar Future Project to help chart our path.</p>

<p>At the first meeting, the stakeholders were given the opportunity to join workgroups that best fit their interests. These workgroups include &ldquo;regulations and ratemaking,&rdquo; &ldquo;markets and business models,&rdquo; and &ldquo;operations and interconnection.&rdquo; The first task for these workgroups will be to help finalize a baseline scenario for our modeling and then to begin the process of developing the pathways to our goal. While many of the same issues will be discussed in each group, they each have a unique and valuable perspective.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be held in the Pittsburgh area on June 8 (venue TBA). After reviewing the baseline scenario, we will begin to look at the &ldquo;Alpha Scenario,&rdquo; which will set the framework for future modeling.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not too late to get involved. Information about this meeting will be posted at dep.pa.gov/pasolarfuture or you can email <a href=""mailto:RA-EPPASOLARFUTURE@pa.gov"">RA-EPPASOLARFUTURE@pa.gov</a> and request to be added to the mailing list or the lists for any of the workgroups.</p>

The Importance of Funding Environmental Public Interest Law,3/8/2017,"<p><em>Pictured: Larry Schweiger, PennFuture President and CEO, PennFuture board member Diana Dakey and her husband Alan Dakey, PennFuture client Dawn Gorsline, Michele Batkowski</em></p>

<p>PennFuture just argued one of the most important environmental cases in recent history in front of the PA Supreme Court. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this role, we were representing two client couples from Fairfield Township who have taken a very brave stand against the natural gas industry&rsquo;s insistence that fracking can and should be allowed in low density residential neighborhoods. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Without PennFuture&rsquo;s talented attorneys, the citizens of Pennsylvania would have no one to argue on their behalf against the highly paid, high power, corporate attorney&rsquo;s proposition of the concept that fracking, which is a private industrial activity, is a &lsquo;public benefit,&rsquo; and that an acre and a half well pad is a &lsquo;public service facility.&rsquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every day, public interest attorneys like ours, take on cases like these, on behalf of people like you and I. &nbsp;</p>

<p>These attorneys either work for non-profit organizations, like PennFuture, or work pro-bono, because without them, decision-making would be made along lines of the financial gains of industries with little to no regard for the people&rsquo;s constitutional rights to clean air or clean water, or to the rights of the environment to protection. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Imagine a world without those people and organizations like PennFuture standing up for you, the public. It is a bleak and dim prospective where government is only influenced by those seeking financial gains, not by those seeking to live their lives free of the harm that comes from being a sacrificial statistic. &nbsp;We need these attorneys to be there, watchful, providing a safety net, and supporting justice. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>We need PennFuture. &nbsp;We need to make sure that PennFuture is funded and that it has the resources to have a team of top environmental talent. &nbsp;We need bright and educated and articulate attorneys who expertly understand the complexity and nuances of Pennsylvania, environmental law, land, and can analyze and argue against the tactics taken by the attorneys that are bought by industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We all sleep better at night knowing that when this happens, PennFuture is taking appropriate and legal action to make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t just happen without a legal fight. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, the corporation &lsquo;s attorneys were able to convince Fairfield Township, PA, in Lycoming County, to allow an exceptional use for a fracking well pad in a non-industrial, non-commercial, low density, mixed use agriculture and residential zone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The company argued that the gas well pad is a &lsquo;public benefit&rsquo; or &lsquo;public service,&rsquo; which would liken it to a hospital or fire station. &nbsp;The flaws in their logic are extensive on that argument, as the activity exists for purely private gains. &nbsp;They also stated that the well pad was &lsquo;low impact&rsquo; and &lsquo;passive.&rsquo; Again, this is an argument that has extensive logic flaws, as is increasingly apparent to the average person thanks to the increase in reports coming to light around the impacts of fracking. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Remember, this particular well pad is targeted to go in amongst residential houses. &nbsp;The company doesn&rsquo;t see the impact on those around the well pad as their problem, and the industry has collectively put their deep pockets behind lobbyists and attorneys with the goal of making this not their problem, or assuring that people and the environment are protected, their responsibility. &nbsp; Again, that is why PennFuture is here. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We, the staff and volunteers and members of PennFuture, know that the citizens are more important than the companies, that the environment is more important than the industry. &nbsp;</p>

<p>And all other issues with natural gas aside, we stand with you when you need us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will take your rights and the protections owed to all of us by the Environmental Rights Amendment all the way to the Supreme Court when necessary. &nbsp; Article I, Section 27, of the PA Constitution states: &nbsp;&lsquo;The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and aesthetic values of the environment.&rsquo; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Our attorneys, like all other public interest attorneys, are funded by the generosity of philanthropists and the collective donations of the people. &nbsp;And on behalf of my children and theirs to come, I thank you for being a part of that and encourage you to urge everyone you know to join in assuring that funding is solidified so that we never find ourselves without.&nbsp;</p>

President Trump's Real Environmental Agenda,3/6/2017,"<p>During his first speech to Congress, President Trump pledged to the American people to &quot;promote clean air and water.&quot; While Trump praises clean air and pure water in his speech, it rings hollow since the first Trump budget will cut the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s by more than 20 percent. With the EPA already seriously underfunded for the work it does, the Trump budget cans one in five employees with much of the cuts aimed at enforcement and oversight of state enforcement. Important environmental protection programs have also been slashed. For example, his proposed cuts will decimate the Chesapeake Bay Program from $73 million to $5 million in fiscal year 2018. We must ignore his lips, but watch his hands and feet. People who care about the environment and worry about our children&rsquo;s future must understand where this is all headed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are still wondering why President Trump&rsquo;s key appointments to vital Federal Agencies such as the EPA, the Education Department, and the Energy Department are nominees who actually despise the very purpose of the agencies they are now running, wonder no more, because it has been made clear that President Trump and Stephen Bannon want to systematically destroy these agencies and gut their regulatory capacities.</p>

<p>Bannon has purposely maintained the scruffy appearance of one who would be better suited at a neighborhood bar stool, and&nbsp;is now in the right-hand seat of power as Trump&rsquo;s chief advisor and confidant. Bannon has largely remained in the shadows, rarely speaking publicly, until his recent comments at the Conservative PAC. It&rsquo;s now clear that Bannon is a fanatic but he should not be dismissed as a wild-eyed White Nationalist. Bannon has big plans for deconstruction of the federal government, and while it appears to be delusional and grandiose, it is not.</p>

<p>At the recent CPAC convention, Bannon provided a lens into the future that Trump has in store for all of us if we let him. With the clearest explanation for why many of Trump&rsquo;s cabinet choices are well known mostly for despising and attacking the very federal agencies they&rsquo;ve been designated to lead, Bannon made it clear that these nominees weren&rsquo;t appointed to lead essential agencies like the Energy Department, Education or the Environmental Protection Agency, but to gut them.</p>

<p>Remember then Texas Governor Rick Perry running for President in 2012 promised to abolish the Energy Department when he forgot its name? While under questioning for confirmation for the Secretary of Energy, Perry was forced to recant his previous position and sounded a much different note.</p>

<p>Scott Pruitt became head of the EPA, despite the fact that he has been trying to shut down the agency with 14 separate lawsuits that we now know from his hidden emails were spawned not in his office, but by lawyers representing the oil and gas industry. Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education, wants American taxpayers to pay for private schools and even poorly regulated &ldquo;fly-by-night online virtual schools&rdquo; rather than properly funding struggling public schools.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has hatched an audacious stratagem to &ldquo;deconstruct&rdquo; critical elements of our government so special interests, especially the fossil fuel industries, can run wild as never before. When Bannon brags about dismantling the &ldquo;administrative state,&rdquo; what he&rsquo;s saying is that Trump will be unleashing corporate predation with a wrecking ball; letting polluters do whatever they want, whenever and wherever they want, regardless of their impact on our environment or the direct harm it inflicts on American communities. He&rsquo;s plotting the elimination of the very rules that citizens need to constrain runaway greed or halt corporate and bank malfeasance that crashed our economy in 2008.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Little wonder that the stock market has been going wild since the election:&nbsp;the speculators and the barons of polluting industry will be free at last.</p>

<p>At CPAC, Bannon said, &ldquo;every business leader we&rsquo;ve had in is saying not just taxes, but it is &mdash; it is also the regulation. I think the consistent, if you look at these Cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason and that is the deconstruction, the way the progressive left runs, is if they can&rsquo;t get it passed, they&rsquo;re just gonna put in some sort of regulation in &mdash; in an agency. That&rsquo;s all gonna be deconstructed and I think that that&rsquo;s why this regulatory thing is so important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deconstruction&rdquo; is Bannon&rsquo;s code word for the shredding of the federal safety net. This rollback of safeguards has been in the aim of dark-moneyed interests since 1971, when Lewis Powell wrote his manifesto to the U. S. Chamber of Commerce. The Lewis memo inspired a long and deliberate takeover of our electoral process systematically executed by minority interests through such means as voter suppression, sophisticated data-driven gerrymandering and toxic amounts of dark money flooding front groups like the Heritage Foundation, fake news outlets and through super PACs.</p>

<p>The race to the bottom begins.&nbsp;President Trump is creating obfuscation when he says he likes clean air and&nbsp;clean water while he recently authorized the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines despite the environmental dangers, and when he took steps to dismantle climate pollution rules, repealed coal mine regulations, endangered species protections and clean water rules. Trump recently signed an executive order crafted by Scott Pruit to kill the &quot;Waters of the U.S. Rule,&quot;&nbsp;which was carefully crafted after a lengthy scientific assessment by EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to clarify the authority of federal regulators over wetlands and waterways under the Clean Water Act.</p>

<p>The South Florida Water Management District is seeing their opportunity to ask the Trump administration to unleash the district from an important 1992 consent agreement with the Bush Administration that committed the water district to clean up the phosphorus pollution that is severely degrading the Everglades National Park and the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. (Remember the massive algae blooms last summer that were killing manatees and choking waterways?)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, western Republicans have changed the laws to allow a give-away of our precious public land estate to western states so they can be delivered to special interests for exploitation. Here in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania General Assembly has launched a study to determine where Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environmental protections exceed the federal government, so they can cut protections down to the weakened levels being advanced in Washington. This is not how we &ldquo;make America great again,&rdquo; in fact, the many reckless actions bring America closer to wholesale destruction.</p>

<p>At the CPAC conference, Bannon warned: &ldquo;If you think they are giving you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s prove Bannon right on this point. We must fight those who have set out to destroy our environmental protections. Bannon&rsquo;s agenda is a clear and present danger to the America we all know and love.</p>

<p>We must demand that our government not only protect existing safeguards, but also create a framework for a clean energy economy that is already creating more jobs than oil, coal, and gas combined.Things can rapidly get much worse than any of us could have imagined in our lifetimes. The United States has already set more than 2,800 new record high temperatures this past month, with 738 new records in the past week alone, while we have seen only 27 record lows. It is time everyone must demand our members of Congress and Senator Toomey to stand up against the deconstruction of our governmental safeguards and not let society crumble from the effects of climate disruption.</p>

<p><strong>Please call each of you lawmakers now. Here&rsquo;s a nifty trick: Text your Zip Code to 520-200-2223 and you&rsquo;ll get a text back with the names and numbers of your federal and state representatives and senators. This is an easy way to get the numbers into your phone book for repeated use. From the shape of things to come, we will all need it.&nbsp;</strong></p>

PennFuture’s “Advocates for Conservation and the Environment” (ACE) Program,3/2/2017,"<p>PennFuture&rsquo;s newly launched <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/join-the-ace-program"">&ldquo;Advocates for Conservation and the Environment&rdquo; (ACE)</a> program is a non-partisan project that organizes teams of volunteers to educate state and federal legislators about conservation and environmental issues. Now, more than ever, the public needs to engage in the democratic process to shape policies that protect our environment and safeguard public health. The ACE program provides citizens the opportunity for precisely this kind of democratic engagement.</p>

<p>Few representatives have the time or expertise to fully understand the implications of all the policies on which they may eventually take a position. ACE volunteers provide policy makers with an opportunity to learn from concerned citizens who live in their respective districts about environmental and public health issues affecting their communities, families, wildlife, and the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through statewide and ongoing in-district meetings between citizen-advocates and their legislators, <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/join-the-ace-program"">the ACE program</a> is designed to build the environmental community&rsquo;s power in Pennsylvania. An in-district meeting is a grassroots, non-partisan effort to build and reinforce relationships with federal and state representatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Importantly, ACE teams meet with Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, to promote policy, not partisanship. In this way, <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/join-the-ace-program"">the ACE program</a> is an extraordinarily effective way to empower citizens with the tools to engage decision makers in their communities while cultivating a sense of ownership in PennFuture&rsquo;s mission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the program works. PennFuture schedules ACE meetings for volunteers. Then, volunteers meet with other local ACE volunteers and a PennFuture coordinator at a convenient location for a brief strategy session to review local issues, talking points, and a few guidelines to follow regarding meeting with legislators. Finally, ACE teams meet with their legislator in his or her local district office to express their concerns and to help shape policies that protect you, your family, and the environment for generations to come.</p>

Finding Pennsylvania’s Solar Future,1/23/2017,"<p><strong>The next few years will be an exciting time for solar energy in Pennsylvania.</strong></p>

<p>Nationwide, the solar industry is booming. Average installation costs dropped 12 percent from 2015 to 2016, and those costs continue to fall. Increasing demand has made jobs in the industry grow almost 12 times faster than the economy as a whole. &nbsp;</p>

<p>With increasing solar installations, related products including home battery storage and affordable electric vehicles may soon see breakout sales. And, this is just the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Change is coming. The question for Pennsylvania is: What will it take for the state to be a leader on solar?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the federal Department of Energy recently announced a cooperative agreement to answer just that question. Work is beginning on a project called, <a href=""http://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/Pages/Finding-Pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-Solar-Future.aspx""><strong>&ldquo;Finding Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future,&rdquo;</strong></a> in which DEP and interested stakeholders* will spend the next 30 months investigating how to expand in-state solar generation to 10 percent of sales by 2030. &nbsp;</p>

<p>That is an exciting goal that is leaps and bounds above our existing target of 0.5 percent by 2020. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Is 10 percent by 2030 too high? Will market demand drive us to even greater sales? Either is possible&mdash;that is what makes 10 percent a good target. We need to look beyond incremental changes that we are sure are achievable and understand what a significant change means. &nbsp;What are the technical challenges, policy issues, and market forces we need to consider? &nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>How the Project Will Work</strong></em></p>

<p>This will be a stakeholder-driven project. Interested people from across Pennsylvania with backgrounds including business, government, utilities, academia, environmental advocacy, and consumer advocacy will have an opportunity to share their views and experience related to policy proposals, technical issues, and the impact of business models and market forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stakeholders will then help decide which of these scenarios will be selected for additional modeling and analysis.</p>

<p>Modeling, conducted by <a href=""https://www.veic.org/"">Vermont Energy Investment Corporation</a>, will help inform the stakeholders as they refine the proposed scenarios into a set of core recommendations. The results will be published as a draft report for public comment, as well as independent academic review. Stakeholders will have another opportunity to revise their recommendations in light of the additional review before the final report is released as Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Solar Future Plan. This report will be available for use by policy makers, regulators, industry, investors, and consumers.</p>

<p><em><strong>Next Steps</strong></em></p>

<p>Together, we can develop a vision of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s clean energy future. To keep informed about the latest news, be sure to check out the project website at <a href=""http://www.dep.pa.gov/pasolarfuture"">www.dep.pa.gov/pasolarfuture</a>.

Funding Our Future,1/12/2017,"<p>We are at the dawn of 2017 and on the precipice of dealing with new political, federal, and state-level elected and appointed officials who are openly hostile to the environment. This is not news. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>But did you know that we need your financial support even more now than we have in almost two decades? &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Right now, we have an amazing opportunity. Every citizen who cares about our environment and our collective future can take this moment in time to push back and have a hand in implementing PennFuture&rsquo;s mission. &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I feel comfortable stating that this is our shared responsibility.&nbsp;And the truth is that without your support, we could not be nearly as effective at preventing the damage we face at the hands of de-regulation and the sale of our public resources to private interests. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This is especially personal to me, which is why I have not only decided to dedicate myself professionally to this organization as its new Chief Development Officer, but also why I am making a personally significant recurring monthly donation to PennFuture as well - <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/donate"">and I strongly urge you to do the same. </a></strong><a href=""http://pennfuture.org/donate"">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I first arrived in Pennsylvania, the staff and leadership of PennFuture were among my first friends and colleagues. I was fresh out of graduate school and was going to work for the U.S. Department of Interior&rsquo;s Office of Surface Mining (OSM) as an Environmental Protection Specialist. I had spent the last six years learning environmental education, policy and law. I knew why congress had passed, and presidents had signed, and courts had upheld laws like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Protection Act. I knew how and why the federal agencies charged with implementing them were created, and how much due diligence, scientific research and public participation had gone into the regulations these agencies wrote. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>That was in 2000, when we were facing an incoming set of elected leadership under the Bush administration who put a target on the back of anything that looked remotely like environmental regulation or species protection &ndash; very similar to the times we are facing now. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I understood the value of watchdog organizations like PennFuture in that political climate, and the importance of their viability, so I looked to my friends at this organization to fight the good fight, as I did my job with the U.S. Department of the Interior. &nbsp;</p>

<p>That was once upon a time when I was young and na&iuml;ve enough to think that the laws were sacred; that regulations required process to undue. As a federal employee, I was initially shocked to find myself inside of a process which was designed to work like molasses so that no individual could do too much too fast, and immediately undo&nbsp;the incremental steps of everyone that had come before them, just as no one in the future could immediately undo theirs. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately, the system&rsquo;s design did not matter at all to the political appointees who were laser-focused on stripping agencies of their abilities to regulate, communicate and coordinate with each other.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The paranoid administration of the time was the same one that sharpened the knife of the Hatch Act, thereby effectively silencing any dissent from individuals inside of the agencies, pulling even the most routine decision-making from the regional and local back to the Washington, DC offices -- under their full and direct control. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Even worse, in very short order, I witnessed the roll-back of legal protections vis-a-vi federal policies and interpretations that were not transparent, and did not incorporate any of what I had thought were required public notice or comment periods. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Unbelievably, a small handful of mining permits that benefitted a small number of people, &nbsp;but were on their very face in violation of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and its regulatory diction, were pushed forward by Pennsylvania&rsquo;s DEP. This happened because of anti-environmental individuals seated by the electorate. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It was done at the expense of the flora and fauna and landscape that make up the state, as well as clean water, clean air, individual homes and farms, and the public&rsquo;s health and safety. It wiped out OSM&rsquo;s long-standing interpretation of the need for balance, ignored all of the scientific work that went into defining that balance, and happened without any real process or evaluation -- just because a handful of people didn&rsquo;t like what most reasonable people saw as reasonable restrictions on mining activity.</p>

<p>The legitimate comments and feedback the public had given when agency rules were passed was swept aside, along with any presumption that as federal employees, our job was to assure that we do no lasting and permanent harm.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This is the reality of the power of a few well-placed ideologues with an anti-environmental agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I made it through about six years of the Bush administration and then I left federal employment to work full-time for nonprofits, feeling disheartened and demoralized, but certainly much wiser when it comes to knowing how much damage an administration can do. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In looking in the rearview mirror, I am confident that this type of damage doesn&rsquo;t just disappear with the next incoming class of legislators or the next administration -- it lingers. And today, the stakes are even higher. I remember back in the early 2000s, I used to wonder if environmental groups were taken unaware. Surely, I thought, if they had been more prepared for the coming onslaught and war against anything that resembled environmental regulation or protection of species or historic places, they could have done something about it. And I was probably right. Had PennFuture had a hefty infusion of funds, they would have been better positioned to win all of these battles on our behalf. &nbsp;And this is what I have joined the team to help with and <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/donate""><strong>I hope you will stand shoulder to shoulder with me to see this through.&nbsp;</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>When nonprofits have money, they can do more and have more impact. &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In fact, with enough money, nonprofits can accomplish solving almost any problem just as effectively as any business or government entity can. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We have top attorneys, lobbyists, outreach staff and leadership. We are a well-oiled machine built out of very smart and experienced people. We know how to do this. There is an astounding difference in effectiveness between organizations that are perpetually under-funded and those that are able to bring in sufficient donations to pay for the staff, infrastructure and program expenses to reach their goals. PennFuture will be well funded for the challenges ahead &ndash; specifically in the next four years &ndash; &nbsp;and it is individuals like you and I, standing shoulder to shoulder, who will make it happen. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PennFuture&rsquo;s goal is simple:</strong> <u><strong>We are your watchdog.</strong></u> We fight big polluters and enforce environmental laws with a team of lawyers to protect your right to clean air and clean water. We work with communities to empower citizens to take ownership of their environment through outreach and education. We work in Harrisburg to defend and support laws that protect the environment and public health. And it is exciting to be a part of making it happen. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My dollars, pooled with yours, will magnify our impact and together, we will get the job done.&nbsp;I look forward to working with all of you and I am already inspired by each of you because I know that together, we can fund our future! &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Everyone enjoys the milkshakes and animals at the farm show, but what stands out most to me is the return of an open dialogue on the importance of clean water.&nbsp;</strong>Kicking-off the week-long celebration last Thursday, the PA Department of Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding and members of the agriculture sector unveiled the annual butter sculpture, paying homage to the long-standing tradition of conservation in farming. As witnessed by the recent survey results from the Penn State Agriculture &amp; Environment Center, in addition to studies from partners in the environmental community, our neighbors in the agriculture sector are doing a lot of good work, but the work is far from over. This year&rsquo;s sculpture is a great hat-tip to the sector&#39;s&nbsp;deep culture of stewardship and taking care of our common natural resources -- but we face a formidable challenge in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><strong>Home to more than 62,000 farms, the Commonwealth is in the midst of an &ldquo;Agriculture Re-Boot&rdquo; initiative. </strong>This initiative aims to assist the agriculture sector in becoming more compliant with the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) &ndash; a regulatory tool in the U.S. Clean Water Act, which describes a value of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a body of water can receive while still meeting water quality standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By all measures, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s agriculture sector is far off-target for achieving its benchmarks for the 2017 EPA mid-point assessments, and the 2025 targets seem unrealistic unless we change our approach statewide. The agriculture run-off of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment erosion are the largest causes of pollution in the Susquehanna. Pennsylvania is the largest issue in getting the Bay to where it needs to be. And it doesn&rsquo;t need to be that way.</p>

<p><strong>With the new political landscape in mind, the way forward is unclear, but we know one thing: water quality and land-use practices are interconnected.</strong> In order to keep our water clean in our pristine trout streams, restore the Susquehanna, and bring the Chesapeake Bay back to life, we need to take action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We need to be smart about our choices and behavior, be creative with new solutions, and not be afraid of stepping out from our ordinary routines. We need to provide more cultural sensitivity to the needs and concerns of rural Pennsylvanians and farmers, but educate and reach out to our neighbors at the same time. Imagine a day where we can freely swim, fish from, and paddle the Susquehanna and its tributaries without fear of contamination.</p>

<p>While these challenges seem large and obtuse, there is a great deal of opportunity for tangible work and projects &ldquo;in the weeds.&rdquo; It is essential that we work and support our local farmers and conservation districts to make a real change in the quality of water in Pennsylvania. This can be done by establishing riparian buffers and streambank fencing on our own land, building rain gardens and landscape that helps collect run-off water in our backyards, advocating for increased stormwater and green infrastructure in your local municipalities, or becoming a voice for statewide and federal policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Be sure to have conversations with your local farmers, join a local watershed association, do your best to buy food locally, and stay engaged with the connection between agriculture and protecting the water we drink.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The coming weeks will set the stage for water policy in Pennsylvania. The Chesapeake Bay office at the DEP will be releasing its stakeholder meeting schedule for the Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan for the Bay clean-up and we hope that you will join and make your voice known.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Call or email your local legislators to support efforts in the new legislature to implement a water usage fee, increase state funding for the DEP in this year&rsquo;s state budget to carry out the WIP, and increase funding for best management practices for farmers and conservation districts. As we enter into an important year, remind and hold accountable Governor Tom Wolf and his administration, your local congressmen and women, and Senators Bob Casey and Pat Toomey for this renewed focus on the marriage between agriculture, clean water, and the Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Water connects us all. Pennsylvania has a long and fruitful history of conservation and agriculture. Let&rsquo;s work together and protect these precious resources so that we can continue to build our clean and abundant future. We have the ability to make a difference and give life.</strong></p>

Silencing the Warning Bells of Climate Science,1/5/2017,"<p>In the 18th century, English poet Robert Southey wrote about a 14th century holy Abbot of Aberbrothok who mounted a bell on a treacherous sandstone reef eleven miles off the east coast of Scotland to warn mariners during severe weather.</p>

<p>As the story goes, a notorious pirate, Ralph the Rover, vandalized the bell and dropped it into the sea on his way to plunder other vessels. Having been gone for a time, and on his journey back to Scotland with a ship laden with booty, Ralph the Rover encountered a severe storm and without warning, struck the reef and sank his vessel. Southey writes of the Rover&rsquo;s final moments as the ship sank:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But even in his dying fear,<br />
One dreadful sound could the Rover hear;<br />
A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell,<br />
The Devil below was ringing his knell.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>For many generations, &quot;The Inchcape Rock&quot; was taught as a cautionary tale to dissuade those who might seek to destroy warning bells.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The poem and the moral justice of the story have long been forgotten as the incoming Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress are moving to destroy the warning bells of climate disruption by ending NASA climate research efforts. </strong>Trump advisor and former Congressman turned lobbyist, working largely for the space industry, Bob Walker, wants to purge what he called &ldquo;politicized science&rdquo; by ending NASA&rsquo;s climate change research and shifting the funding to a &ldquo;deep space&rdquo; program in a blatant move to eliminate the warning bells of climate science.</p>

<p>California Governor Jerry Brown responded that his state might even launch its own space program if Trump shuts down the climate satellites and ends NASA&#39;s role in climate science. For the past several weeks, climate scientists have been busy copying federal climate databases to private servers to prevent their destruction.</p>

<p>After the warning bells of NASA are silenced, the Trump administration will undo EPA&rsquo;s carbon pollution regulations and fulfill the <a href=""http://pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Paris-Climate-Accord-Too-Little-Too-Late-or-an-Important-First-Step"">promise of abandoning the Paris Accord.</a> These are not idle campaign promises by the Twitterer-in-Chief. Despite the many clear climate-warming signals across the planet in 2016, Trump has assembled an administration for accomplishing his reckless ambitions against climate and environmental protections.</p>

<p><strong>Secretary of State</strong><br />
His nomination for Secretary of State, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson (Putin&rsquo;s friend), is ripe for blatant self-dealing over President Obama&rsquo;s Russian oil sanctions as he unwinds the Paris Accord. As the head of a global corporation more powerful than many nations, Tillerson has repeatedly misrepresented basic climate science, supporting&nbsp;borderless world trade in oil while calling for &quot;a global free market for energy.&quot; Tillerson, who has never shown any interest in representing America&rsquo;s broader national interests in the world, will now be our Secretary of State. While ExxonMobil has always had its thumb on the scale of our state department policies, never before has a CEO of a major oil company ever been suggested for this critically important public office.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Protection Agency</strong><br />
<a href=""http://pennfuture.org/News-PennFuture-CEO-Reacts-to-EPA-Appointment"">I cannot think of a worse choice for EPA Administrator than Scott Pruitt.</a> Pruitt has deep and troubling entanglements with the fossil fuel industry as Oklahoma&rsquo;s Attorney General. He ignored thousands of Oklahoma homeowners who suffered structural damages from earthquakes, now occurring every 12 hours, caused by fracking injection wells. As Oklahoma&rsquo;s Attorney General, he disassembled the environmental enforcement division and led a nationwide fight against EPA&rsquo;s efforts to address climate change, toxic air pollution and to protect the waters of the nation. I suspect the Koch Brothers are high-fiving over this announcement, as the fox will be put in charge of the chicken coop.</p>

<p><strong>Department of Energy</strong><br />
At the Department of Energy, Trump is replacing a brilliant Dr. Ernest Moniz with former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who is best known for dancing with the stars and for promising to eliminate several federal agencies as a presidential candidate five years ago. When asked to name the agencies, Rick Perry forgot the Energy Department&#39;s name and ended by saying, &ldquo;Oops.&quot; Perry&rsquo;s A&amp;M college transcript consisted mostly of C&rsquo;s and D&rsquo;s, and contrasts with Moniz, who has a Bachelor of Science degree summa cum laude in Physics from Boston College and a Doctorate in Theoretical Physics from Stanford University. Perry apparently hates efficiency and clean energy investments and hopes to abolish the energy department that oversees everything nuclear, as well as a large and complex portfolio. What could go wrong with this appointment?</p>

<p><strong>The Jagged Rocks of Climate Change</strong><br />
The World Meteorological Organization reported that the global temperature in 2016 is about 1.2C above pre-industrial levels, dangerously close to the 1.5C threshold of the Paris climate agreement. Last year set another new record as the hottest year in history, and not surprisingly, 2016 also set new records for severe and devastating weather.</p>

<p>According to the American Red Cross: &quot;The American Red Cross provided more assistance to the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by these disasters across the United States than in the past two years combined. In 2016, Red Cross volunteers responded to 180 significant disasters in 45 states and two U.S. territories including wildfires, storms, flooding, Hurricane Matthew and other emergencies...&quot;</p>

<p>Things can only get much worse if the Trump administration pretends that the growing threats from storms, sea level rise, droughts and forest fires don&#39;t exist, or if they ignore the consequences of massive volumes of carbon pollution-trapping enormous amounts of heat and acidifying our oceans.</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of our political ideology, religion or worldview, there will be a severe price to be paid for silencing the bells of climate science.</strong></p>

2017-18 State Legislation Session: Looking Ahead,1/3/2017,"<p>Get ready for a wild ride.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to describe what could happen when the Pennsylvania General Assembly begins a new, two-year session this week. It has only been two months since we wrapped up the 2015-16 session, which was marked by historic legislative attacks on environmental protection, but next year already portends to even worse outcomes.</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball and can&rsquo;t tell exactly which bills will advance and which won&rsquo;t, here are some major stories to watch for that could have an outsized impact on environmental protection:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>High stakes around the Governor&rsquo;s veto:&nbsp;</strong>Governor Tom Wolf&rsquo;s veto pen is what stood in the way of the General Assembly gaming the Commonwealth&rsquo;s regulatory process so that legislators could unilaterally hold up new rules on polluters. The threat of a veto held up a number of other potential environmental rollbacks. But the November election has changed the dynamic of the General Assembly, providing for a one-party veto-proof majority in the Senate, and a very achievable 13 votes away from a veto-proof majority in the House. &nbsp;The Governor&rsquo;s decision whether or not to veto legislation now becomes even higher stakes.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Protecting Act 129: </strong>Act 129 is Pennsylvania&rsquo;s central energy efficiency program that is saving ratepayers money and cutting pollution. Yet, at the behest of a handful of large companies, the Senate passed SB 805 in October, which would dramatically cut funding for the program and lower its energy efficiency goals. The House ran out of time to advance the legislation, but the bill will be back in 2017 with more time to succeed.</li>
	<li><strong>Closing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar borders:</strong> Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) has a loophole that allows utilities to take credit for solar projects built in other states. Bipartisan legislation advanced in the House and Senate last session to close this loophole and ensure that solar projects are built in-state. Look for similar legislation to move in the new session.</li>
	<li><strong>New subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear plants: </strong>Three states have extended new subsidies to nuclear power plants, in part to keep zero-carbon electricity flowing to ratepayers. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s aging nuclear power plants are in a similar situation, and may require new legislation to keep them open. In addition, numerous bills aimed at subsidizing natural gas were proposed last session and may move under the new-look General Assembly.</li>
	<li><strong>Water pollution issues take center stage:</strong> Water pollution issues dominated the headlines in Pennsylvania last session with little legislative action. Whether its lead, PFOA&rsquo;s, cancerous fish in the Susquehanna, or cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay watershed, numerous high profile water pollution issues are knocking down the doors of the General Assembly. With a new two-year session to come up with solutions, there is little excuse for inaction.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Keeping electronics out of landfills:</strong> Pennsylvania&rsquo;s covered electronics recycling market is broken. New electronics are smaller and lighter than previous generations, yet the recycling mandate on electronics manufacturers are set by more recent sales. As a result, recycling quotas are being met earlier in the year, leaving many municipalities without a viable electronics recycling option. Without legislative change, more and more old televisions and large electronics will end up on street corners and landfills, potentially causing pollution concerns, in addition to the eyesore. A number of bills were filed last session to fix the issue and more legislative action is expected in 2017.</li>
</ol>

<p>Stay tuned as we keep you informed as to what happens next in the State Legislature.</p>

Pittlandia: Is Pittsburgh the New Portland?,12/22/2016,"<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen the articles. They have titles like, &ldquo;Pittsburgh: The New Portland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Portland is Over: All the Cool Kids are Moving to Pittsburgh.&rdquo; So, is it true?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pittsburgh and Portland are constantly being compared as the numbers of microbreweries and organic food markets in each increase, while they were once primarily known for industrial pasts. But in my humble opinion, the articles miss a crucial factor: <strong>how do they compare in terms of their respective environmental agendas?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>As a native Pittsburgher who recently visited Portland for the first time, and with my current position at PennFuture, I could not help but compare the two through my own research and first-hand observations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let&rsquo;s start by comparing air quality. The American Lung Association&rsquo;s 2016 State of the Air Report shows the following:</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; High Ozone Days&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Particle Pollution&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Total Population at Risk<br />
Pittsburgh &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>F &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; F &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,231,255<br />
<strong>Portland &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>B &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 776,712</p>

<p>This chart is very representative of what I experience on a day-to-day basis in Pittsburgh and also represents what I experienced on my week-long vacation in Portland. With high asthma rates, it&rsquo;s no surprise Pittsburgh ranks in the dirtiest 15 percent of U.S. cities, while Portland is in the 78.7 percent of the cleanest cities. Spending a day hiking in Eagle Creek, Oregon was such a unique experience due to that fresh, clean air&mdash;something that people all over the United States should not have to travel 2,500 miles to experience.</p>

<p>So, why is our air not as clean? While Portland has taken a proactive stance on developing sustainable urban design and combatting climate change, Pittsburgh is just starting to follow suit. Here are some examples:</p>

<h2>Bicycling</h2>

<p>Portland is a founding member of the Cities for Cycling initiative, which includes traffic engineers and planners from some of the best bicycling cities sharing information and developing a national urban bicycle design guide. According to its 2030 plan, the group hopes to implement an expansion of intersection bike boxes, improve signal infrastructure by installing bicycle detection in bicycle lanes, and consistently improve bike lanes. The city has also provided bicycle parking in commercial areas known as &ldquo;bicycle corrals.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps the most fascinating part of my trip occurred as my friend and I walked downtown, where we witnessed nearly every car yield to pedestrians and bicyclists due to the Oregon Pedestrian right-of-way laws. It really was like a Portlandia episode.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh has a few more hurdles when it comes to biking. We have a more drastic winter season (as opposed to Portland&rsquo;s two seasons: dry or wet) and a lot more hills. However, despite these setbacks, the bike scene is really picking up due to advocacy groups like Bike Pgh! With the group&rsquo;s hard work, Pittsburgh City Council recently approved the Mayor&rsquo;s Complete Streets Policy, which states, &ldquo;Everybody, regardless of who they are, where they live, or how they get around, should have the choice to travel in a safe and convenient manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition to this ordinance, Pittsburgh now has 50 Healthy Ride bike stations, released a report on pedestrian and bicycling safety in Pittsburgh, and teaches nearly 1,500 youth and adults on safe riding skills.</p>

<h2>Climate Action Plan</h2>

<p>The City of Pittsburgh, using the Portland model, is currently looking into identifying two to three neighborhoods to serve as Pittsburgh pilots that have high cycling activity, in which they can install bike racks in strategically identified parking spots and monitor the effectiveness of the program as part of the Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan outlines the measures that government, businesses, higher education institutions, and citizens of the City of Pittsburgh have begun and can continue to undertake to help mitigate the local effects of global climate change. It&rsquo;s created by the Pittsburgh Climate Initiative, which is a collaborative involving city and county government, non-profits (like PennFuture), higher education, and the business community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we enter 2017, the third edition of the Climate Action Plan will be released, with Portland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan as its chief model. For example, in Portland, there is a &ldquo;FAR Bonus Program&rdquo; that offers a Floor Area Ratio Bonus in its building code.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this program, developers may build an extra 3 feet x 2 per foot of green roof they construct without obtaining additional permits. There is also a reimbursement of up to $5 per square foot on green roofs, because they are storm water-reducing infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pittsburgh plans to use this strategy by building off of the existing URA Pittsburgh Home Rehabilitation Program loan program for low-income households, exploring clean energy bonds through the Federal government, establishing a pilot limited to a certain number of homes and businesses, and communicating results with private lending institutions to encourage energy efficiency financing options. This is just one of many examples of how Pittsburgh could follow Portland&rsquo;s footsteps on climate change.</p>

<p><strong>We know this kind of change can happen, even in a city like Pittsburgh. </strong>For instance, this past October, Pittsburgh became the 17th city to adopt a legislated building benchmarking ordinance that requires commercial buildings 50,000 square feet and over to disclose energy and water usage in order to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although this was also modeled after Portland&rsquo;s energy benchmarking policy that is a little more ambitious (requiring commercial buildings 20,000 square feet and over), Pittsburgh is using Portland as its model to continuously work to become a better, greener Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>With this in mind, we can hopefully have a cleaner, healthier future in store.&nbsp;</strong></p>

My Mission is PennFuture's Mission.,12/7/2016,"<p>After the recent presidential election, I immediately asked myself this question:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What can I do to have a positive impact during the next four years, when much of what has been accomplished in terms of advancing a clean energy future will be under attack?</strong></p>

<p>Little did I know, the answer would soon be&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Become the new Communications Director at PennFuture.</strong></p>

<p>I could not be more thrilled to join a team of such incredible, intelligent and passionate leaders in the arena of fighting for our environment, advancing clean energy, working on behalf of communities being undermined and destroyed by polluters, and pouring energy into preserving the landscape and beauty of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>As we embark on an unforetold journey beginning on January 21, 2017 at the federal level, what I do know is that our state is in good hands when it comes to advocates &ndash; like my colleagues and the volunteer leadership at PennFuture - who are working on behalf of the citizens of Pennsylvania. Every citizen deserves clean air to breathe, pure water to drink, and a natural landscape to explore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mission of PennFuture is one that I am personally passionate about and excited to advance as the new Communications Director. I look forward to implementing new initiatives that allow us to expand our reach, deepen our impact, and increase engagement across every county in the state.</p>

Taking Stock of the 2015-16 Legislative Session </br> Historic Attacks and Lost Opportunities,11/21/2016,"The Pennsylvania General Assembly&rsquo;s two-year session wrapped up with a flurry of last-minute activity, capping off months of historic attacks on environmental priorities. It was a tumultuous session characterized by numerous attempts to weaken environmental regulations, halt progress toward a clean energy economy, and open up more land to natural resource extraction.<br />
<br />
PennFuture worked tirelessly to defend the Commonwealth against these attacks and strengthen natural gas drilling regulation, protect endangered species, promote energy conservation, and advance Pennsylvania&rsquo;s opportunity to develop a timely carbon reduction strategy. The fight is not over though. Many of the bills described below are expected to be re-introduced during next session, which begins January 2017.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, here&rsquo;s a rundown of the session&rsquo;s environmental wins, narrow escapes, lost opportunities and losses.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Wins</strong></u>
<ul>
	<li>Defeated attempt to commercialize state park lands (HB 2013). This bill would have advanced efforts to open up state parks to private developers to build hotels, golf courses, amusement parks, commercial and industrial parks and other uses incompatible with our state parks&rsquo; natural assets. It was soundly defeated in the House.</li>
	<li>Defeated effort to ban municipalities from addressing plastic bag pollution (HB 1280). This last-minute bill would have banned local municipalities from banning of levying fees on plastic bags, which account for a significant portion of water pollution and litter issues. It was soundly defeated in the House.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<u><strong>Narrow Escapes</strong></u>

<ul>
	<li>Senate advanced legislation to gut energy efficiency program (SB 850). This legislation was pressed as a commonsense effort to make manufacturing more competitive, but in fact it was a veiled attempt to allow the largest state industries to avoid paying their fair share for energy conservation programs, resulting in far less investment in this cost-effective program. It passed the Senate, but did not receive a vote in the House.</li>
	<li>House and Senate almost broke the state building code process&hellip;again (HB 568). This controversial legislation would have locked in a failed process that has disallowed Pennsylvania from adopting modern building codes, include strong energy conservation standards. It passed the Senate, was amended by the House and passed, and amended again and passed by the Senate. The House never took final action.</li>
	<li>Governor vetoes attempt to break state regulatory process (SB 562). This seemingly innocuous bill would have given the legislature the power to indefinitely delay new regulations, potentially killing new proposed environmental safeguards. Both the House and the Senate passed it, but Governor Wolf issued a veto..</li>
</ul>
<br />
<u><strong>Lost Opportunities</strong></u>

<ul>
	<li>Bad amendments taint good gas royalty bill (HB 1391). Rep. Everett pushed for good legislation to require gas drillers to pay landowners who lease their land for drilling the full amount they owe in royalty payments, yet numerous amendments aimed at weakening new gas drilling regulations and barring methane regulations set the stage for unnecessary legislative battles around a good bill. It ultimately did not come up for a vote in the House.</li>
	<li>Effort to rollback endangered species protections sinks good government bills (SB 1166 and SB 1168). This pair of bills would have allowed the Fish and Boat and Game Commissions to set license fees and better fund their programs. Unfortunately, amendments were offered in the House that would have weakened protection for endangered species. The bills passed without amendments in the Senate, but did not receive votes in the House.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<u><strong>Losses</strong></u>

<ul>
	<li>Creating an environmental regulation hit list (SR 385). Senate Resolution 385 directs the Joint State Government Commission to conduct an unnecessary review of environmental laws and regulations to determine if they are more protective than federal laws. Once identified, the study will provide convenient cover to roll back laws designed to address environmental threats specific to Pennsylvania. It passed overwhelmingly in the Senate (Note, resolutions only have to pass their respective chamber and don&rsquo;t require gubernatorial approval).</li>
	<li>Delaying state planning to reduce carbon pollution (SB 1195). This hotly contested bill implements a convoluted process that all, but guarantees Pennsylvania will wait until the very last minute to submit its plan to reduce carbon pollution by 30% by 2030 under the Clean Power Plan. The bill passed both the House and Senate. Governor Wolf signed it into law.</li>
	<li>Halting new rules for conventional oil and gas drilling (SB 279). After 5 years of public input, legislative input, and policy debate the General Assembly advanced legislation to stop new rules for conventional oil and gas drilling from taking effect. These rules would have set commonsense standards to protect water, communities, and air from a polluting industry that has been working under the same regulations for over 30 years without updating. The bill passed the House and Senate. Governor Wolf signed it into law.</li>

What a Trump presidency means for our environment and future generations.,11/17/2016,"<h3>What&#39;s Next for Pennsylvania?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s the morning after and we are all wondering what is next? It is a very dark place for the environment and I will not try to put varnish on it. President-elect Trump has promised to abolish EPA, to appoint climate deniers to key posts to retreat on environmental regulations, renege on the Paris Accord, and dismantle the efforts to advance clean power and bring back coal. Trump will have the House, Senate and Supreme Court on his side, so with a unified Republican government, his words will not come back empty.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The environment lost the biggest battle imaginable and the worst part of that is these urgent issues were rarely if ever mentioned. Greenland is in full-scale melt, the Arctic is moving to a complete summer melt and the earth is setting record-breaking temperatures now spewing its own carbon dioxide and methane. In the face of this and while watching the rapid expansion of frack gas, pipelines and generation infrastructure, there was not a single environmental or climate question in the debates. The media has utterly failed to address environmental threats.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the face of Citizen&rsquo;s United, gerrymandering and massive amounts of dark money, the environmental community has largely failed to restructure itself to be able to be actively engage politically to add our voice to the debate. In that vacuum, major donors moved into the state, created their own structures, spent millions creating incompetent and ineffective grassroots while we were left sitting on the sidelines. We must own that and make this moment a turning point.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
While Hillary Clinton gave one good speech in Florida and mentioned the climate from time to time, neither candidate really made protecting our environment a pivotal National issue. At the state level, I understand we lost our best friend Representative Leanne Krueger-Braneky and Katie McGinty went down in the most expensive Senatorial election in American history. The process has utterly failed and the majority of American voters have failed our children and their future.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On a personal level it is extremely distressing. Once again, I just shake my head at the enormous mistake that American voters made yesterday as I consider my grandchildren&rsquo;s future. I have been fighting for progress on climate for most of my career and I have experienced repeated legislative failures starting with the BTU tax in 1993. Looking forward and we must do that, we need to be careful not to be Pollyanna or even reassuring. This is kick in the worst place possible and we all need to search within ourselves, within our community and decide how we move forward in the days ahead.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I am reminded of what General U. S. Grant did after a brutal defeat at both Shiloh and at Wilderness. Grant did not retreat, as other Generals urged him to do, instead he attacked. In the face of daunting and almost impossible odds I dust myself off and together we must march forward.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The fight is not over, attack we must.<br />

The Paris Climate Accord: Too Little Too Late or an Important First Step?,11/16/2016,"After 21 painful years of negotiations following the sabotaged Kyoto Climate Agreement, 191 countries finally found agreement on a new strategy to confront climate change and agreed to the Paris Climate Accord last December. Since then, the Paris Accord has been ratified by 82 nations with sufficient emissions to trigger the early launch of the Accord. It finally took effect on November 4th.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The goals of the Accord are to reduce greenhouse emissions, help countries adapt to wrenching changes brought about by a warming climate and finance projects in developing nations that repair damage wrought by climate change. The explicit goal is for all nations to work together to hold global average temperature increases to well below 3.6 &deg;F (2 &deg;C) above pre-industrial levels in an effort to avoid the vast damages caused by dangerous climate change.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
President-elect Trump has vowed to pull the United States out of this historic agreement, and rescind the Clean Power Plan that requires coal-fired power plants to cut carbon pollution. That would be a tragedy for our country and our families. It would also be a huge lost opportunity to capitalize on the economic advantages of leading the transition to safe, clean energy.<br />
<br />
Pennsylvania has a significant responsibility to cut carbon pollution. As the third largest carbon emitter in the nation, Pennsylvania produces about 2 days of the year&rsquo;s worldwide total emissions. But Pennsylvania has much to gain from aggressively pursuing efforts to cut carbon emissions by committing to an ambitious effort to clean up our energy production by investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Pennsylvania already has 66,000 people working in clean energy industries &ndash; more than those employed in the coal and gas industries combined. With the right mix of state policies including strengthening our renewable energy and energy efficiency standards, giving renewable energy full access to the electricity grid, and fairly paying homeowners for the excess power they generate from rooftop solar power plants, we could significantly increase the jobs and the economic impact of clean energy.<br />
<br />
But right now, that&rsquo;s not the path our misdirected state legislature is taking. Under the influence of the shale gas and coal interests, the legislature has repeatedly tied the hands of the Wolf administration and the DEP to work on a rational climate plan or increase our renewable energy standards. They have attempted to significantly weaken our successful energy conservation program.<br />
<br />
Pennsylvania clearly risks heading down a blind alley by investing in the wrong energy path promising enormous risks and stranded fossil fuel assets. There are 32 additional gas-powered plants proposed for Pennsylvania in various stages of consideration, development, and construction. The planning assumption going into these new plants is not based on growing urgency for constraining carbon emissions but is based solely on sufficient recoverable gas reserves and traditional capitalization considerations over the expected lifetime of new gas combustion turbines up to about 60 years. These assets along with the new pipelines, compressor stations and other gas appurtenances will not be viable in short order as we approach climate tipping points.<br />
<br />
The stakes could not be higher. Thirty-one highly respected American scientific organizations recently came together to warn Congress: &ldquo;If we are to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change, emissions of greenhouse gasses must be dramatically reduced. In addition, adaptation will be necessary to address those impacts that are already unavoidable.&rdquo; The well-known former director of NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Jim Hansen has gone so far as to warn, &ldquo;2 degrees of warming is actually a prescription for long-term disaster&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
The Paris Accord is an important first step to move 191 nations in the direction of addressing our common future to avoid a long and growing list of catastrophic climate consequences. The Clean Power Plan offers a specific way forward, and Pennsylvania is in an enviable position to capitalize on the new economic development that a transition to clean energy offers. Working together we can and we must do our part as responsible stewards. To walk away from this vital work is both immoral and stupid.",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,Larry J. Schweiger
Defending Net Metering in Pennsylvania,11/7/2016,"<h2>Customers who generate their own clean energy deserve a fair price.</h2>
When customers choose to install solar panels, they not only take control of their own energy spending and help produce clean renewable energy, they help their neighbors as well. &nbsp;Every new kilowatt-hour (kWh) of clean energy on the grid means less pollution and the lower demand means wholesale prices are lower too. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Before our state Legislature passed the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) act in 2004, customers could install solar panels, but there was no guarantee they would get a fair price if they sold <img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/net%2Dmetering%2Dimage%2Ejpg"" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;"" />their extra power back to their utility. &nbsp;AEPS changed that by allowing net metering of energy. &nbsp;Now, when you generate more electricity than you use, the law requires the utility to pay you the full retail value of what you generate. &nbsp;For residential customers that averages around $.13 per kWh.<br />
<br />
In Pennsylvania, and in many other states, net metering programs are under attack with the claim that paying anyone more than the wholesale cost of generation is unfair. &nbsp;This is disingenuous. The actual value of solar is far higher than the wholesale cost of generation. &nbsp;Only paying the wholesale cost of generation means that utilities avoid all transmission costs, congestion pricing and other factors that can drive the actual price of power on the spot market far higher. &nbsp;This means paying customer generators as little as $.03 per kWh at times when the market price could spike as high as $1.00 per kWh.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Attempts to end net metering entirely have, so far, not gained traction in Pennsylvania, but in February of 2014, the Public Utility Commission (PUC) begun the process of passing new regulations that create additional &nbsp;restrictions.<br />
<br />
PennFuture has worked with a coalition of solar industry representatives, environmental groups, and interested citizens to fight this rulemaking and we&rsquo;ve been successful and preventing some of the worst provisions from moving forward. &nbsp;After hearing from the PUC and the opposition, the &nbsp;Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) voted unanimously to disapprove &nbsp;of the rulemaking on two separate occasions. &nbsp;This led the PUC to drop plans to cap the size of net metered systems, but problems still remain with the PUC&rsquo;s approach.<br />
<br />
As a result of the final rule, we may see utilities seek new fees on customer generators and people may be denied interconnection in situations that the legislation allows. &nbsp;Should that occur, the fight to defend net metering will have to be taken to the courts.",Climate; Community; Energy; Environment,"Rob Altenburg, Senior Director for Energy and Climate"
Waste Coal: Time to finish what we started.,11/18/2015,"<h2>Alternatives to Waste Coal Plants</h2>

<p><br />
Even if we keep our waste coal plants on line, there is still a significant amount of waste ash that must be disposed of. Some have suggested planting beach grass to stabilize the pile and prevent leaching into the ground water. Planting beach grass on waste coal piles is a much cheaper option than building more waste coal plants and has been shown to bring life back to long-dead waste coal piles for only 6-10 percent of the cost of conventional methods. Within a few years, beach grass can enable native plants to take over, allow organic matter to accumulate around plants, and form a plant layer that prevents erosion, holds water, cools the surface, and looks a lot better. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
While beach grass is a promising alternative that could be much cheaper than more traditional forms of reclamation, it would still be an expensive undertaking to plant on piles across the state. Waste coal plants are certainly not free either, but they have a perceived advantage in that their costs do not usually show up as line items in the state budget. &nbsp;Even so, as you will see below, waste coal plants do receive a significant amount of benefits from the state.</p>

<h2><br />
Laws and Tax Credits for Waste Coal</h2>

<p><br />
Believe it or not, in Pennsylvania, waste coal is considered to be an alternative source of energy. Under the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act (AEPS), electricity derived from waste coal (16.5 percent) is considered a Tier II resource. Check out Achieving 100 percent Renewable Energy IS Possible and Smog and Mirrors in West Virginia for background on PA&rsquo;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Having waste coal as a Tier II source was meant to encourage the use of waste coal, but it has not had much of a benefit considering that Tier II credits traded at an average of only $0.13 per MWh in 2013/2014, even lower than the $0.22 per MWh for which it traded during the 2012/2013 auction. (Compare that to $9.78 for Tier I and $94.39 for solar PV in 2013/2014.)<br />
<br />
Waste coal qualifies for the Alternative Energy Production Tax Credit (to date, no tax credits from this program have been earned, $0 was spent on these tax credits in 2012-2013, and $10 million was projected for 2013-2014), the Coal Waste Removal and Ultraclean Fuels Tax Credit (can be used against sales and use tax, corporate net income tax and capital stock/foreign franchise tax), and the Alternative Fuel Incentive Grants (in September, DEP awarded $1.8 million in AFIG funding to four innovative alternative fuel technology projects but it&rsquo;s not clear how much, if any, went to waste coal).<br />
<br />
The two U.S. Senators for Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey (R) and Bob Casey (D), introduced an<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-amendment/41/text"" target=""_blank""> amendment </a>(which fell short by six votes and was rejected by the Senate on Jan. 21) to the Keystone XL pipeline legislation that would exempt waste coal power plants from complying with the smog and soot limits in the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s (EPA) Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the acid gas and sulfur dioxide pollution limits in the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). The purpose of the amendment was, &ldquo;To continue cleaning up fields and streams while protecting neighborhoods, generating affordable energy, and creating jobs.&rdquo; (Notice how they don&#39;t mention cleaning up the air in the purpose statement and that the two rules apply to air pollution.) &nbsp;It is also important to note that even though their amendment was rejected, they could still introduce it as a standalone bill.<br />
<br />
Our senators are not alone in their requests. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has asked for exemptions for waste coal from the Clean Power Plan, Boiler MACT and, likely, other rules. Electric generators who burn waste coal are also asking regulators to weigh their environmental benefits against their environmental harms and count their carbon emissions as zero.</p>

<h2><br />
Transparency</h2>

<p><br />
Deciding whether to accept more pollution in one area (air or water) in order to remove pollution elsewhere (water or air) will be difficult. Rather than continuing the practice of providing incentives to waste coal plants, we need to stop and evaluate the alternatives. While contemplating alternatives, as PennFuture recommended in our policy document &ldquo;<a href=""/Files/Admin/GovWolfPolicyRecommendations%5F201501%2Epdf"" target=""_blank"">A Fresh Start for Pennsylvania: 26 Steps that Governor Wolf can take to improve Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and economy</a>&rdquo; and as DEP Acting Secretary John Quigley has stated on numerous occasions, <strong>DEP needs to be transparent about its decision-making. &nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
If more waste coal plants are to be built, DEP should provide detailed analysis relating to the potential impacts to the air in the surrounding communities and request comments concerning its proposal. And if they decide to let the waste coal piles be, then they need to carefully monitor the nearby water supply and keep local citizens up to date on their findings. Or even if they decide it&#39;s best to use beach grass or other alternative measures to tackle the problem, we need to know what those measures are and if/how they are working. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Whatever steps DEP takes to handle our waste coal problem, they need to be open and honest about it. It is of utmost importance that we are informed about decisions impacting our air and water. As stated in my previous blog post, we have a constitutional right to clean air and clean water in Pennsylvania.<br />

Governor's budget and the solar saw-buck,5/15/2015,"Every year, the<a href=""http://pre.thesolarfoundation.org/solarstates/pennsylvania"" target=""_blank""> Solar Jobs census</a> is released and every year, I write a blog about how Pennsylvania has fallen behind other states. Here we go... For the 2014 Solar Jobs Census, we are now 15th in the nation, with only about 2,800 employed in the solar industry in Pennsylvania. Since 2012, when we were fifth in the nation for solar jobs, ten other states have moved ahead of us. Yep, we&#39;ve lost about 1,800 solar jobs since 2012 and our neighbors, New Jersey and New York, rank in the top five nationally. Okay, now the good news: This year, the jobs report was released at about the same time Gov. Tom Wolf issued his 2015/2016 budget proposal, where solar silver linings abound.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Gov. Wolf&rsquo;s proposal is to direct $50 million to the successful Pennsylvania Sunshine Rebate program. This should be welcome news to renewable energy boosters and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar industry. <img alt="""" class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/CEW%5F222%2Epng"" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;"" />From 2009 through the end of 2013, this program distributed over $103 million in solar rebates to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s residential and commercial sector. The distribution of these funds resulted in over half a billion dollars in immediate economic activity for the state and continues to pay dividends in the form of energy savings for the over 7,000 homeowners and businesses who took advantage of the program.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Because costs for solar have declined overall, the allocation of $50 million in additional funds could result in the installation of 11,000-18,000 solar projects for the state.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Avoiding a boom and bust:</strong> It is important to recognize that Pennsylvania&#39;s solar industry has endured several boom-bust cycles over the last several years. Due to the declining cost of solar and pent-up demand, $50 million may go fast, creating another such boom and bust. Steps should be taken to analyze and modify program parameters and rebate levels so that the program has the greatest potential to spur the development of the maximal volume of new installations. The last incentive level offered by the program was $.75 per watt with maximum rebates per project set at $7,500 for residential and $52,000 for commercial installations. Both the per-watt rebate amount and the overall project cap may deserve reconsideration.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The need for financing:</strong> Although the risk of financing solar has <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/toddwoody/2013/01/25/solar-crowdfunding-startup-lets-ordinary-investors-own-a-piece-of-the-sun/&amp;refURL=http://pfenergycenter.blogspot.com/2015/03/governors-budget-and-solar-saw-buck.html&amp;referrer=http://pfenergycenter.blogspot.com/2015/03/governors-budget-and-solar-saw-buck.html"" target=""_blank"">proven to be low</a>, consumer and commercial solar loan products are scarce, especially in Pennsylvania. States like New York and <a href=""http://www.energizect.com/your-home/solutions-list/smarte"" target=""_blank"">Connecticut</a>&nbsp;have hedged their own funds to back loan programs that offer competitive rates for solar energy to make up for the lack of private equity. Pennsylvania should follow suit. The Governor&#39;s budget proposes $100 million in &quot;Alternative Energy&quot; funding, the details of which have not yet been announced. Renewable energy advocates should hope that the development of financing is part of the plan.<br />
<br />
Financing support for solar energy may be as important, or even more important, in the long term then the revitalization of the PA Sunshine program alone. And the concept is not new to Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania Treasury has backed energy efficiency improvements for homeowners through the Keystone HELP program since 2009 and may be well positioned to offer a solar loan product if the right funding reserves are made available.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Governor&#39;s budget, if enacted, has the potential to turn the years of bad news that came with the release of the annual solar jobs census into something of which we can be proud once more. Renewable energy boosters should voice their support for the budget while challenging the office to make smart choices and do more to avoid the bust cycle of the past.<br />

PA streams: Let's protect the best of the best.,4/29/2015,"Anyone who spends time in the outdoors knows Pennsylvania has abundant water resources. With more than 86,000 miles of streams, we&rsquo;re second only to Alaska in the number of miles of streams. Although many thousands of these stream miles are polluted by a variety of sources, we are fortunate to find other rivers and streams in excellent health, capable of supporting a variety of fish and other aquatic life. The rivers and streams with the most outstanding water quality are afforded the greatest degree of protection, and are designated High Quality (HQ) or Exceptional Value (EV).<br />
<br />
Pennsylvania has a detailed process for protecting the existing use and designated uses of all HQ and EV waters. The public may petition the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to upgrade a stream to HQ or EV if sufficient data exist to support the request, and partner agencies such as the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission may do the same. The DEP regional office may also make a recommendation for a stream re-designation. Ultimately, all streams proposed for re-designation must be approved by the Pennsylvania Environmental Quality Board (<a href=""http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/Environmental_Quality_Board/21511"" target=""_blank"">EQB</a>).<br />
<br />
Protecting streams through anti-degradation policies and <strong>ensuring that streams have the appropriate regulatory designation prior to permitting development activities</strong> within the watershed is critical to protecting the high quality of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s water resources, for today and for the future.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, t<strong>he DEP has not proposed any stream re-designations to the EQB since September 2011.</strong> Since then, hundreds of miles of streams have been petitioned for upgrade with no formal action by the DEP to re-designate these streams and apply regulatory protections, mainly due to very limited staff.<br />
<br />
To remedy this, we recommend that Gov. Tom Wolf ensure that the DEP has adequate staff resources to ensure that streams receive appropriate stream designation under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.
<ul>
	<li>The DEP should have adequate staff designated: 1) to review stream re-designation petitions submitted by the public and by partner agencies, and 2) to conduct stream surveys to determine appropriate regulatory designations.</li>
	<li>The DEP should revise and streamline its internal process for reviewing stream re-designation petitions.</li>
	<li>The DEP should respond to petitions for stream re-designations in a timely fashion and propose rulemaking packages to upgrade or downgrade streams to the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) at least three times per year.</li>
</ul>
<br />
This recommendation, along with many others, can be found in a recent PennFuture report that highlights actions Gov. Tom Wolf and his administration can take to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment.<br />

2017-18 State Legislation Session: Looking Ahead,,"<p>Get ready for a wild ride.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to describe what could happen when the Pennsylvania General Assembly begins a new, two-year session this week. It has only been two months since we wrapped up the 2015-16 session, which was marked by historic legislative attacks on environmental protection, but next year already portends to even worse outcomes.</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball and can&rsquo;t tell exactly which bills will advance and which won&rsquo;t, here are some major stories to watch for that could have an outsized impact on environmental protection:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;High stakes around the Governor&rsquo;s veto: Governor Tom Wolf&rsquo;s veto pen is what stood in the way of the General Assembly gaming the Commonwealth&rsquo;s regulatory process so that legislators could unilaterally hold up new rules on polluters. The threat of a veto held up a number of other potential environmental rollbacks. But the November election has changed the dynamic of the General Assembly, providing for a one-party veto-proof majority in the Senate, and a very achievable 13 votes away from a veto-proof majority in the House. &nbsp;The Governor&rsquo;s decision whether or not to veto legislation now becomes even higher stakes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Protecting Act 129: Act 129 is Pennsylvania&rsquo;s central energy efficiency program that is saving ratepayers money and cutting pollution. Yet, at the behest of a handful of large companies, the Senate passed SB 805 in October, which would dramatically cut funding for the program and lower its energy efficiency goals. The House ran out of time to advance the legislation, but the bill will be back in 2017 with more time to succeed.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Closing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar borders: Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) has a loophole that allows utilities to take credit for solar projects built in other states. Bipartisan legislation advanced in the House and Senate last session to close this loophole and ensure that solar projects are built in-state. Look for similar legislation to move in the new session.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;New subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear plants: Three states have extended new subsidies to nuclear power plants, in part to keep zero-carbon electricity flowing to ratepayers. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s aging nuclear power plants are in a similar situation, and may require new legislation to keep them open. In addition, numerous bills aimed at subsidizing natural gas were proposed last session and may move under the new-look General Assembly.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Water pollution issues take center stage: Water pollution issues dominated the headlines in Pennsylvania last session with little legislative action. Whether its lead, PFOA&rsquo;s, cancerous fish in the Susquehanna, or cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay watershed, numerous high profile water pollution issues are knocking down the doors of the General Assembly. With a new two-year session to come up with solutions, there is little excuse for inaction.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Keeping electronics out of landfills: Pennsylvania&rsquo;s covered electronics recycling market is broken. New electronics are smaller and lighter than previous generations, yet the recycling mandate on electronics manufacturers are set by more recent sales. As a result, recycling quotas are being met earlier in the year, leaving many municipalities without a viable electronics recycling option. Without legislative change, more and more old televisions and large electronics will end up on street corners and landfills, potentially causing pollution concerns, in addition to the eyesore. A number of bills were filed last session to fix the issue and more legislative action is expected in 2017.</p>

<p><em>Note: This is the first in an ongoing series of blogs taking a deeper look at the comments, misinformation, hyperbole, and criticisms from the natural gas and petrochemical industry as well as their allies in their attempt to sell Pennsylvanians on the virtues of its climate-killing sector. As we&rsquo;ve seen in other states, the industry often uses misinformation tactics to seow doubt, build political support, and put a wedge in public debate. These blogs will provide an easily digestible point/counterpoint to some of the most prominent statements, quotes, and attacks.</em></p>

<p><u><strong>Introduction and Context</strong></u><br />
Speaking at the Climate Action Summit in downtown Pittsburgh on Oct. 30, 2019, <a href=""https://www.nextpittsburgh.com/features/i-oppose-any-additional-petrochemical-companies-heres-what-mayor-peduto-said-at-the-climate-action-summit/"">Pittsburgh&nbsp;Mayor Bill Peduto announced</a> he would not support any further petrochemical development in western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The mayor&rsquo;s comments surprised&nbsp;environmentalists and industry supporters alike, albeit for different reasons.&nbsp;In the hours that followed his remarks, Peduto was subjected to harsh criticisms and attacks from those who have a very different vision for the future of western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that emotions are running so high. What&rsquo;s at stake is no less than the very future of millions of people. Pennsylvania is already home to one ethane cracker plant and could soon be home to another, as it was announced earlier this month that <a href=""https://www.wesa.fm/post/report-exxonmobil-scouting-property-2nd-cracker-plant-beaver-county#stream/0"">ExxonMobil is scouting for land in the area</a>. The next few months and years will shape the landscape &ndash; both economic and geographic &ndash; for decades to come.</p>

<p>Some of the statements and remarks issued against Mayor Peduto on Wednesday are at best ignorant and, at worst, intentionally false.</p>

<p><strong>Point: Building out natural gas and petrochemicals provides Pennsylvania both economic growth and a clean environment.</strong> David Spigelmyer, the president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, stated that &ldquo;clean and abundant American natural gas is enabling economic growth or environmental progress for every single Pennsylvanian.&rdquo; He went on to say that some politicians &ldquo;push extreme or fringe bans on responsible energy development.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint: Neither gas or petrochemicals is clean, rather both are and can make profound impacts on our environment. Pointing out their impacts is neither extreme or fringe.</strong> It is&nbsp;disingenuous to suggest there is anything &ldquo;clean&rdquo; about natural gas. Nothing about the extraction process&mdash;fracking, spills and leaks&mdash;is <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/natural-gas-carbon-pollution-climate-change-20190708.html"">clean or sustainable for our communities or our environment</a>, and the methane that leaks during natural gas development and processing is <a href=""https://blogs.princeton.edu/research/2014/03/26/a-more-potent-greenhouse-gas-than-co2-methane-emissions-will-leap-as-earth-warms-nature/"">30 times more potent as a greenhouse gas</a> than carbon dioxide. Methane is one of the <a href=""https://unfccc.int/news/new-methane-signs-underline-urgency-to-reverse-emissions"">major contributors to climate change</a>.</p>

<p>A final point on Spigelmyer&rsquo;s statement: there is nothing &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; or &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; about standing up and fighting for clean air and clean water. Pennsylvanians have a constitutional right to both and western Pennsylvania has a long history of environmental damage borne from industry. The mayor&rsquo;s comments reflect on this history and the public health and environmental damage caused by the coal and steel industry. It&rsquo;s fair to question allowing another well known polluting industry access to the region, particularly after <a href=""http://cleanair.org/wp-content/uploads/HIA-Final.pdf"">decades of progress in cleaning up</a> our air and water.</p>

<p><strong>Point: Anyone who opposes the petrochemical buildout also opposes economic growth and new jobs for the region.</strong> Rep. Mike Turzai, who represents a portion of Allegheny County and serves as the speaker of the House of Representatives, said in a statement posted online Wednesday that Peduto&rsquo;s comments represent an &ldquo;anti-growth mindset that is both irresponsible and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint: Opposing petrochemicals is not an &quot;anti-growth mindset.&quot; It is a pro-public health mindset that puts the health of an entire region ahead of profits for global companies like Shell.</strong> In one sentence, Turzai calls the mayor&rsquo;s comments irresponsible and dangerous, but then turns around and supports turning western Pennsylvania <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/plastics-appalachia-next-cancer-alley-fracking-public-health-ethane"">into the next Cancer Alley.</a> Again, there is nothing irresponsible about supporting&nbsp;clean air and clean water.</p>

<p><strong>Point: The region doesn&#39;t have&nbsp;to choose between good jobs and clean air and water.</strong> Darrin Kelly, the president of the Allegheny/Fayette Central Labor Council, issued a statement saying &ldquo;it just isn&rsquo;t true that we have to choose between good jobs and clean air and water.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint: It&rsquo;s a false narrative that the petrochemical industry provides both good jobs and clean air and water</strong>. While there are many ways to advance both economic development and environmental progress, the petrochemical has no history of doing so. The Shell cracker plant <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/energy-environment/plastics-shell-pennsylvania-plant.html"">will emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year</a>, the equivalent of about 480,000 extra cars on our roads. It will also release <a href=""https://breatheproject.org/patrolling-our-air/"">more than 30 tons per year of hazardous air pollutants</a>&nbsp;like benzene, which is linked to cancer and childhood leukemia, and particulate matter linked to lung and bladder cancers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Western Pennsylvania already has some of the <a href=""https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/states/pennsylvania/"">worst air quality in the entire country.</a> If someone staunchly and unapologetically supports Shell&rsquo;s petrochemical plant, and is also hopeful for more cracker plants to come, then that person&nbsp;is making a tradeoff that includes sacrificing public health for jobs. It&rsquo;s that cut and dried.</p>

<p>Peduto, unlike his critics, seems not to have forgotten <a href=""https://conserveland.org/blog/article-i-section-27-of-the-pennsylvania-constitution/"">Article 1, Section 27 of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s constitution</a>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Pennsylvanians have a right to clean air and clean water, and the petrochemical industry doesn&rsquo;t have permission to infringe on those rights &ndash; unless we grant them that permission. <o:p></o:p></p>

Let the Failed DNA Hydrogen Hub Go,,"<p>The Decarbonization Network of Appalachia (DNA) Hydrogen Hub put forward by <a href=""https://teampa.com/"">Team PA</a> failed to secure federal funding and lost two major industry backers, but TeamPA is still attempting to move forward with the Ohio-Pennsylvania-West Virginia dirty hydrogen project.</p>

<p>By building it in the heart of the Marcellus Shale region, the DNA Hub will allow high-polluting fossil fuel industries to survive market changes. Unfortunately, that means the communities of Southwestern Pennsylvania will continue to bear the brunt of terrible air quality, impacts to water and further destruction of Appalachia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Background on the Federal Hydrogen Hub Projects</strong></h3>

<p>In September 2022, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced that it was soliciting applicants for its <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/oced/regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-0"">Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub Program (H2Hubs)</a>, which would direct billions of dollars to large-scale <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-The-Basics-of-Hydrogen"">hydrogen projects</a> across the nation through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>A total of three applications included Pennsylvania:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ARCH2</li>
	<li>MACH2</li>
	<li>DNA H2Hub</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project claimed to leverage Pennsylvania&#39;s existing infrastructure, technology expertise, and skilled labor force. The promoters of the DNA project &ndash; which was not chosen by DOE to receive federal dollars&nbsp; &ndash; are attempting to press on anyway, despite the deep risk of environmental and human harm to Southwestern PA. Why? A peek behind the curtain provides some answers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.arch2hub.com/"">Appalachia Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub (ARCH2)</a> is a WV-OH-PA-based &ldquo;<a href=""https://rmi.org/clean-energy-101-hydrogen/"">blue</a>&rdquo; hydrogen project and will utilize fracked-gas methane along with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to produce hydrogen and mitigate carbon emissions. The <a href=""https://mach-2.com/"">Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2) </a>is a PA-NJ-DE-based &ldquo;green&rdquo; hydrogen project and will utilize renewable energy to produce hydrogen. Both the ARCH2 and MACH2 projects advanced to the next round. However, the <a href=""https://www.decarbonizationnetworkofappalachia.org/"">Decarbonization Network of Appalachia (DNA)</a> project, another blue hydrogen hub based in OH-PA-WV, did not move forward. Getting denied billions of dollars in federal funding would be a good reason to scrap the project and move on, especially when another very similar project located in the same geography is moving forward. But Team PA, DNA&#39;s prime applicant, refuses to see the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>The DNA H2Hub promised to <a href=""https://teampa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DNAH2HubPublicSummary.pdf"">&quot;unlock affordable, clean hydrogen and decarbonize the supply chains, manufacturing, and power production in America&rsquo;s industrial heartland.&quot;</a>&nbsp; One of the clear goals of this project was to provide methane for polymer manufacturing for plastics production and energy production. This goal would be accomplished by doubling down on the fracked-gas methane production capacity in southwestern Pennsylvania. In essence, the project would seed and ultimately establish an artificial economic life-support system for the failing fracked gas industry, which is struggling to compete with low-cost renewable energy and is suffering from unfavorable market forces.</p>

<p>Southwestern Pennsylvania is home to some of the <a href=""https://www.lung.org/media/press-releases/pittsburgh-sota-2023#:~:text=The%202023%20%E2%80%9CState%20of%20the,year's%20report%20to%20a%20'C'"">most polluted communities</a> in the nation due to the legacy of steel, plastics, and refining operations based in the region. In fact, it is precisely this industrial history that makes it such an attractive place to try to seed hydrogen, a fuel that can be clean but can also just be a clean facade, or greenwashing. Communities here suffer the consequences of decades of hosting extractive, energy-intensive, and high-pollution industries. While there&rsquo;s no shame in the work folks here have done in the past, it&rsquo;s a simple fact that this legacy has left these communities economically dependent on these industries and struggling to emerge from under their smog-filled shadows. Locating the DNA H2Hub project in the heart of the Marcellus Shale region allows these high-polluting industries to continue this cycle of dependence,and the communities of Southwestern Pennsylvania will continue to be the ones holding the bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fenceline communities in southwestern Pennsylvania don&#39;t want more methane fracked from the ground, transported through leaky pipelines, and converted into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. They want a sustainable and healthy economy based on renewable energy, energy storage, sustainable manufacturing, and family-sustaining union jobs.</p>

<h3><strong>Blue Hydrogen Fails Economics 101</strong></h3>

<p>Even the fossil fuel giants recognize that it is time to flip the switch. Both Shell and Equinor pulled out of the DNA project before the Biden administration even announced the winners of the DOE&#39;s program. Now, <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2022/07/30/blue-hydrogen-climate-oil-and-gas/#:~:text=Blue%20hydrogen%20produces%20no%20carbon,the%20most%20potent%20greenhouse%20gas."">Shell is working on green hydrogen projects in Europe, Australia, and India</a>. Meanwhile, Equinor, which is Germany&#39;s primary source for gas, is collaborating with several other energy companies to field test hydrogen technology - <a href=""https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/hydrogen/abb-joins-hypilot-project-alongside-yara-equinor-20231030"">&quot;ultra-efficient electrolyzers&quot; with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost and &quot;facilitating the widespread adoption of large-scale green hydrogen production.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Why would these energy titans move their focus overseas to develop green hydrogen when the Marcellus Shale region is drowning in methane? Because they are profit-motivated, and the <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Turning-PA-into-a-Hydrogen-Hub-is-not-a-Sustainable-Energy-Solution"">economics for blue hydrogen do not make sense</a>. Equinor, in particular, can attest to the risk involved in developing blue hydrogen at-scale. The international company has a<a href=""https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/02/15/experts-sound-alarm-oil-sectors-blue-hydrogen-push/""> history of failed attempts at CCS projects</a>. The company had to abort a CCS project because <a href=""https://www.tu.no/artikler/to-av-tre-prestisjeprosjekter-for-co2-lagring-er-mislykket/234802"">the reservoir was at risk of collapsing</a>, and a <a href=""https://www.tu.no/artikler/ma-bruke-to-milliarder-kroner-for-a-redde-snohvit-gassen/235227"">second was halted because the injected CO2 was polluting the methane extracted from the site</a>. What&#39;s more, when Equinor was known as Statoil in 2013, it shutdown its <a href=""https://www.equinor.com/en/news/archive/2013/09/20/20SepMongstad.html"">Mongstad CCS plant</a> after just about a year of operation. Through decades of trial and error, Equinor has experienced the economic and technical challenges of blue hydrogen, and rather than continuing to invest in technology that consistently fails in both arenas, it is moving in a new direction.</p>

<p>Recently, Team PA offered a <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/PublicParticipation/Citizens%20Advisory%20Council/CACPortalFiles/Meetings/2024_01/Team%20PA%27s%20Hydrogen%20Presentation%20to%20DEP%20CAC%20-%20Thomas%20Murphy.pdf"">presentation</a> about the MACH2, ARCH2, and DNA hub projects to the Department of Environmental Protection&#39;s (DEP) <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/PublicParticipation/Citizens%20Advisory%20Council/CACPortalFiles/Meetings/2024_01/January%202024%20CAC%20Agenda%20-%20Version%202.pdf"">Citizens Advisory Council (CAC)</a>. During that presentation, Thomas Murphy, the Senior Managing Director of Strategic Energy Initiatives, said that in spite of two of its major partners pulling out and a lack of federal funding, the organization was moving forward with the project and would continue to collaborate with Mitsubishi. <strong><em>In the face of contrary market forces, lack of government investment, unproven technology, and abandonment by industry leaders, maddeningly, Team PA insists on doubling down on methane-derived hydrogen.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>The bottom line is that blue hydrogen isn&rsquo;t climate friendly. Even when operating at its most efficient, experts argue that the blue hydrogen technology available right now is only 78% effective at capturing its carbon emissions. It takes additional energy input for carbon capture technology to run, which means that<a href=""https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/02/15/experts-sound-alarm-oil-sectors-blue-hydrogen-push/""> &quot;due to the increased amount of fossil gas needed to power the CCS process, blue hydrogen likely had a 20% higher carbon footprint than burning methane alone.&quot;</a> This should be said again: blue hydrogen, which supposedly takes a high impact fuel and makes it lower-impact, actually has a higher footprint than if it was never created in the first place. This is why groups like PennFuture are calling for <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Chasing-the-Rainbow-Carbon-Capture-is-Magic-Thinking"">investment in renewables first</a>, before throwing good money at bad technologies that perpetuate fracking and all of the negative health outcomes and economic failures that come with it.</p>

<h3><strong>The DNA Hub Will Only Perpetuate the Harms of the Past</strong></h3>

<p>Team PA claimed that the DNA hub would improve the economic conditions for workers by providing good-paying jobs for a &quot;marginalized, underserved, and fossil fuel-dependent region.&quot; In reality, it would maintain the status quo by offering the same hollow promises that the fossil fuel industry has offered for centuries, refusing to acknowledge the real threats that this project poses to the environment and, consequently, to workers and local communities. Simply put, the DNA H2Hub, if completed, will perpetuate the boom-bust economic cycle created by the extraction of both fossil fuel and labor resources with detrimental environmental and health consequences.</p>

<p>It would behoove Team PA, the Commonwealth, fenceline communities, and workers to follow Equinor&#39;s lead. Pennsylvanians - especially the most vulnerable, disaffected, and disenfranchised among us - do not need more empty promises and cycles of a boom-bust economy. We need a stable economy, a stable climate, and a healthy environment. Ironically, fossil fuels seem to be going the way of the dinosaur. And yet Team PA seems unwilling to recognize this fact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania needs Team PA to read the writing on the wall and pivot. They need to focus on serving the residents and workers of the Commonwealth, instead of chasing a scheme designed to keep the fracked gas industry afloat and funneling resources away from real solutions like renewables, battery storage, and building a sustainable economy.&nbsp;</p>

The Importance of Agriculture to Clean Water,,,,
The Opportunity for Green Stormwater Infrastructure in Philadelphia’s Rebuild Initiative,,"<p>By combining the goals of Green City, Clean Waters and the Rebuild Community Infrastructure (Rebuild) Initiative, Philadelphia can align two major infrastructure investments and multiply its investment in its residents, our neighborhoods, and the environment.</p>

<p>The Rebuild Initiative, made possible by the Philadelphia Beverage Tax, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in physical improvements to our neighborhood parks, recreation centers, and libraries. From a list of more than 400 eligible sites, the Rebuild office is prioritizing neighborhoods that face high rates of poverty, drug crime, and poor health outcomes. It is selecting facilities where investment will promote community development and stabilization, as well as sites that are in extremely poor condition. It is currently moving forward on revitalizing more than 50 sites.</p>

<p>In addition to making physical improvements to these sites, Rebuild prioritizes engaging community members in the site planning and design process as well as promoting diversity and economic inclusion through small business and workforce development initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parks, recreation centers, and libraries offer many social and community benefits. Libraries create opportunities for learning and access to important services. Parks and recreation centers are areas where neighbors gather for play, exercise, social interaction and other leisure activities. They also serve as safe spaces for our city&rsquo;s residents. Studies have shown that having access to parks or green space can reduce stress and contribute to improved general psychological health and well-being for people who live or work nearby.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rebuild represents a major investment in our city and its people. Another major city investment &ndash; Green City, Clean Waters &ndash; creates very similar tangible benefits for residents while also creating a cleaner and more resilient environment. Green City, Clean Waters is Philadelphia&rsquo;s 25-year stormwater management program initiated in 2011 that invests primarily in green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) to manage combined sewer overflows. As stormwater runs off roads, parking lots, and roofs it picks up oil, dirt, and other pollutants that make their way to storm drains.</p>

<p>Approximately sixty percent of Philadelphia&rsquo;s storm drain system is a combined system that mixes stormwater with household wastewater. Most large storms cause untreated sewage to overflow directly into local rivers and creeks. The Philadelphia Water Department defines GSI as a &ldquo;soil-water-plant system that intercepts stormwater, infiltrates a portion of it into the ground, evaporates a portion of it into the air, and in some cases releases a portion of it slowly back into the sewer system.&rdquo; GSI tools reduce pollution and flooding events by naturally slowing and filtering rainwater before it enters the city&rsquo;s stormwater system.</p>

<p>Green City, Clean Waters&rsquo; cornerstone is the tangible benefits beyond Clean Water Act compliance that other approaches cannot achieve. GSI implementation has the potential to accomplish substantial triple bottom line benefits&mdash; economic, social, and environmental. GSI creates community green space, revitalizes vacant lots, enhances recreational use, and even has the potential to reduce illegal drug use in public spaces. It decreases heat stress and energy use while improving air quality and contributing to climate change resiliency. It also stabilizes property values and reduces poverty through job creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Water Department (PWD), the agency tasked with implementing Green City, Clean Waters, exerts minimal direct control over city property. PWD cannot accomplish all necessary public GSI projects without strong partnerships with other city agencies and stakeholder communities. Parks and recreation centers are more than just the physical buildings &ndash; they are situated on impervious surfaces and open spaces, thereby providing ideal opportunities to manage stormwater with GSI.</p>

<p>While the Rebuild Initiative process includes a commitment to sustainability, communities can advocate for GSI projects that provide additional benefits. The Rebuild Initiative is prioritizing community engagement to inform the improvements made to facilities. Public participation in GSI and parks and recreation center design is essential for achieving the positive community benefits they are expected to create.</p>

<p>Residents can advocate for GSI in the Rebuild Initiative by attending Rebuild community engagement events, meeting with park advisory committees, friends groups, and civic associations, requesting GSI be implemented in design plans, meeting with their city council members to discuss Rebuild investment, and writing a letter to the editor in support of GSI investment in their Rebuild site.</p>

<p>Green Stormwater Infrastructure is integral to Philadelphia&rsquo;s economy, environment, and social equity. If you agree, please sign our petition <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/keepphillygreenandwaterclean/index.html"">here</a>, which will be delivered to city council.</p>
",Keep Philly Green & Water Clean,
The People Have A Right: A Brief Overview Of Environmental Rights Amendment Case Law,,"<p>Pennsylvania&#39;s Constitution provides a unique Environmental Rights Amendment that guarantees our right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment and requires the Commonwealth to conserve and maintain Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources for the benefit of all people. Since the ERA&rsquo;s adoption in 1971, Pennsylvania courts have had the task of determining what it means. PennFuture constructs a brief history of the Environmental Rights Amendment court cases and the decisions that interpret and apply this important law.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>In the Beginning&nbsp;</h2>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Commonwealth v. National Gettysburg Battlefield Tower, 311 A.2d 588 (Pa. 1973)&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one of the earliest cases brought under the ERA, the Attorney General sought to prevent a private company from constructing a 307-foot observation tower 700 feet from Gettysburg National Military Park. The Attorney General argued that the tower violated the ERA because it would despoil the natural and historic values of the battlefield. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the ERA did not, by itself, allow the government to stop the actions of private parties in the absence of some other law prohibiting the activity. Since the ERA does not define things like &ldquo;clean air,&rdquo; &ldquo;pure water&rdquo; and &ldquo;historic value,&rdquo; allowing the government to bring suit against private parties for interfering with those values would mean that &ldquo;individuals could be singled out for interference by the awesome power of the state with no advance warning that their conduct would lead to such consequences.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Payne Era&nbsp;</h2>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Payne v. Kassab, 312 A.2d 86 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1973), affirmed by Payne v. Kassab, 361 A.2d 263 (Pa. 1976)&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next major ERA decision came in 1976. Residents of Wilkes-Barre claimed that the ERA prevented PennDOT from paving over a portion of a public park to widen a highway because doing so would harm the historic value of the park. The Commonwealth Court rejected &ldquo;such an absolute interpretation&rdquo; of the ERA and instead held that the ERA was intended to allow &ldquo;controlled development of resources rather than no development.&rdquo; The Court concluded that the ERA requires a balancing of environmental concerns and other legitimate government interests. It also devised a three-part test to assess whether the proper balancing had taken place. This test, which came to be known as the <em><strong>Payne test</strong></em>, asks:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Was there compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations relevant to the protection of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s public natural resources?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Does the record demonstrate a reasonable effort to reduce the environmental incursion to a minimum?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Does the environmental harm which will result from the challenged decision or action so clearly outweigh the benefits to be derived therefrom that to proceed further would be an abuse of discretion?&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>The Court held that the paving of a portion of the park to widen the highway satisfied this test and was thus permissible under the ERA. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not explicitly affirm the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s three-part test but agreed with the lower court that &ldquo;it is manifest that a balancing must take place&rdquo; between&nbsp; the environmental values protected by the ERA and other important societal values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s decision in <strong>Payne v. Kassab</strong> ushered in a nearly forty-year period of failed ERA claims. Because the first prong of the <em>Payne test</em> asks whether the challenged action complies with all applicable statutes and regulations, the question of whether any particular action violated the ERA effectively collapsed into the question of whether the action complied with other environmental laws. Under the <em>Payne test</em>, where no other law was violated, the ERA provided no additional protection for the environment. In addition, the <em>Payne test</em> effectively dictated that no action could violate the ERA unless the environmental harm &ldquo;clearly outweighed&rdquo; any benefit to be gained by the action. In practice, courts rarely found this to be the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other important decisions also came out of the Payne era, for example:&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Community College of Delaware County v. Fox, 342 A.2d 468 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1975)&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Residents argued that the Department of Environmental Resources (DER) violated the ERA by issuing a permit allowing the Central Delaware County Authority to expand sewer service. The residents argued that the permit would induce additional development in environmentally sensitive areas, leading to potential water pollution effects. The Commonwealth Court rejected this argument because it concluded that the ERA cannot expand the powers of a state agency like DER. Instead, the ERA operates &ldquo;only to limit such powers as have been expressly delegated by proper enabling legislation.&rdquo; The General Assembly had not given DER the authority to consider the effect of future land development when deciding whether to issue permits, so the ERA could not be used to compel DER to consider or make decisions based on such concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Robinson Township&nbsp;</h2>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Robinson Township v. Commonwealth, 83 A.3d 901 (2013)&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In 2013, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reinvigorated the ERA with its decision in <strong>Robinson Township v. Commonwealth</strong>. In this case, several municipalities, environmental advocacy organizations, and other parties challenged amendments to the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Act, known as Act 13. Among other things, the challengers argued that Act 13 violated the ERA because it forced every municipality in the Commonwealth to allow oil and gas drilling by right in all zoning districts.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In its decision, the Court opined that the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s ERA decisions up until that point had weakened the meaning of the ERA by tending to define the ERA&rsquo;s broad constitutional rights in terms of compliance with various other laws. It criticized the Payne test, saying that it was not based on the text of the ERA, improperly narrowed the scope of the ERA, and minimized the constitutional duties of the non-legislative branches of government. A better analytical scheme was needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Providing that analytical scheme, the Court explained that the ERA is structured in &ldquo;three mandatory clauses that define rights and obligations.&rdquo; The first clause establishes Pennsylvanians&rsquo; right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic values of the environment. It operates to protect the people from governmental action that unreasonably causes actual or likely deterioration of these features. This clause does not impose an express duty on the government to enact specific affirmative measures to promote clean air, pure water, and the preservation of different values of the environment, but it does impose an obligation to refrain from unduly infringing upon that right by legislative or executive action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second and third clauses work together. The second clause guarantees the common ownership of the people, including future generations, of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources. This applies to a narrower category of &ldquo;public&rdquo; natural resources than is covered by the first clause, but nevertheless implicates relatively broad aspects of the environment, including state-owned lands and other resources that &ldquo;implicate the public interest&rdquo; such as ambient air, surface and ground water, and wild plants and animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third clause establishes a public trust&mdash;a type of legal relationship whereby the Commonwealth as &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; must conserve and maintain Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources (called the &ldquo;corpus&rdquo; of the trust) for the benefit of all Pennsylvanians, present and future, referred to as &ldquo;beneficiaries&rdquo; of the trust. The Court explained that this means that the Commonwealth has a duty to conserve and maintain Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources with prudence, loyalty and impartiality. It also means that the Commonwealth must prevent and remedy degradation, diminution, and depletion of those resources, whether they occur through direct state action or due to the state&rsquo;s failure to restrain the actions of private parties. The Commonwealth&rsquo;s trustee obligations are both negative and affirmative, meaning that the Commonwealth not only has a duty to prevent degradation of public natural resources, but to act affirmatively to protect the environment by passing laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court went on to caution that the ERA does not call for a stagnant landscape, the derailment of economic or social development, or the sacrifice of other fundamental values. It is not intended to stop development. Rather, the ERA means that economic development cannot take place at the expense of unreasonable degradation of the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
The Court also explained that the ERA imposes obligations and limitations on all branches and levels of government&mdash;including local government&mdash;because the quality of the environment is a task with both local and statewide implications. Because the ERA is a constitutional command, the General Assembly cannot take away local governments&rsquo; responsibilities under it, nor can it remove the necessary and reasonable authority local governments need to carry out their constitutional duties. Therefore, the Court held, the portion of Act 13 that removed local governments&rsquo; authority to decide where oil and gas operations may be located within their boundaries violated the ERA and must be struck down.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Post-Robinson Township&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Only three of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court&rsquo;s seven justices agreed with the reasoning in Robinson Township, although a fourth agreed with the outcome based on a different rationale. This meant that the provisions of Act 13 that forced municipalities to allow oil and gas development in all zoning districts were invalidated, but the Court&rsquo;s analysis of the ERA did not become binding precedent on lower courts. Because a majority of the Supreme Court had not conclusively rejected the Payne test, the Commonwealth Court continued to apply it for several more years, until the Supreme Court definitively rejected it in a case known as PEDF II.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>PEDF II</h2>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Pa. Envtl. Def. Found. v. Commonwealth, 161 A.3d 911 (Pa. 2017) (PEDF II)&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next significant ERA decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court came in 2017. In this case, the Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Fund (PEDF) challenged the leasing of state-owned land for oil and natural gas development and the budgetary scheme that dispersed the revenue from those leases. This scheme redirected over $330 million that would have been used for conservation purposes under prior law to the General Fund, where it was appropriated for a variety of state government purposes unrelated to maintaining and protecting public natural resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court began its analysis by decisively rejecting the <em>Payne test</em>, stating that it was unrelated to the text of the ERA and stripped the ERA of its meaning. This time, four Supreme Court justices agreed with this holding, finally spelling the end of the <em>Payne test</em>. The four-justice majority also affirmed Robinson Township&rsquo;s statement of basic ERA principles, thus solidifying those principles into binding precedent. The Court went on to elaborate on the Commonwealth&rsquo;s trustee duties, firmly grounding these in private trust law. These duties include the duty of loyalty, which imposes an obligation to manage the corpus of the trust so as to accomplish the trust&rsquo;s purposes for the benefit of the trust&rsquo;s beneficiaries, and the duty of impartiality to treat all beneficiaries equitably in light of the purposes of the trust. The Commonwealth&rsquo;s discretion as to how to handle Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources is limited by these trustee duties and the purpose of the trust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Court also held that the proceeds from the sale of public natural resources, including the sale of oil and gas from public lands, are to be considered part of the corpus of the trust and must be dealt with in the same way as other public natural resources. Therefore, the Commonwealth is not entitled to spend that revenue on general budgetary items in any way it sees fit; those funds must be directed toward the purpose of the trust&mdash;conserving and maintaining Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources. Accordingly, the Court held that the budgetary provisions that took revenue generated from the sale of oil and gas on state lands and placed them in the General Fund without requiring the Commonwealth to put them toward conserving and maintaining public natural resources violated the ERA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remainder of the Court&rsquo;s decision, as well as several subsequent decisions, dealt primarily with characterizing the precise nature of the revenue generated by oil and gas leases and the precise scope of the activities that could be funded with that revenue. For example, in a later case, <strong>Pennsylvania Environmental Defense Foundation v. Commonwealth, 279 A.3d 1194 (Pa. 2022)</strong>, the Supreme Court held that a trustee is entitled to incur reasonable costs in administering the trust, and, therefore, oil and gas revenues could be used to fund general operating expenses of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources such as salaries, wages, and travel expenses for its employees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Recent Cases&nbsp;</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the years since Robinson Township and the PEDF cases, Courts have tended to focus on language in those two seminal cases stating that the ERA protects only against unreasonable degradation of natural resources and &ldquo;does not call for a stagnant landscape&rdquo; or &ldquo;require a freeze of the existing natural resource stock.&rdquo; Although Payne&rsquo;s explicit balancing test has gone by the wayside, courts have continued to view the Commonwealth&rsquo;s ERA obligations in terms of a balance between the duty to maintain and conserve natural resources for the benefit of all the people and other legitimate government interests. The effect has been that, when specific government actions have been challenged, courts have focused on whether the challenged action represents an appropriate balance between environmental interests and other concerns or is instead an unreasonable degradation of the environment. In nearly all cases, courts have decided that the appropriate balance has been struck and no unreasonable degradation has or will occur. Often, these decisions have resulted from what courts or local decision-making bodies have found to be inadequate evidence of alleged environmental harms.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>One such case is <strong>Frederick v. Allegheny Twp. Zoning Hearing Bd., 196 A.3d 677 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018)</strong>. In this case, residents of Allegheny Township challenged a zoning ordinance that permitted fracking by right in all zoning districts, subject to various restrictions. The Commonwealth Court held that the challengers had not produced sufficient evidence that fracking was harmful to the environment or public health and, even if they had, Township had appropriately balanced those concerns against the economic benefits of fracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Courts have also doubled down on the principle, first articulated in <strong>Community College of Delaware County v. Fox</strong> in 1975, that the ERA does not give executive branch agencies like the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) additional powers or authority beyond what the General Assembly has given them by statute. On multiple occasions, courts have held that DEP and other agencies like it cannot create regulations, make decisions, issue or deny permits, or take any other actions based on ERA concerns if there is no state statute allowing them to do so. For example, the <strong>Commonwealth Court in Marcellus Shale Coalition v. Department of Environmental Protection, 193 A.3d 447 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018)</strong>, invalidated a regulation that required DEP to consider impacts to species of special concern when issuing permits for oil and gas development because the statute that created the permitting scheme only authorized DEP to consider impacts to endangered and threatened species.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The same applies to municipalities, who cannot act beyond the powers given to them by the General Assembly. For example, in <strong>Frederick v. Allegheny Township</strong>, the Court held that municipalities lack the power to replicate the environmental oversight that the General Assembly has conferred upon DEP and other state agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Courts continue to wrestle with the ERA and the implications of Robinson Township and PEDF II. Courts have never directly addressed what preservation of the &ldquo;scenic&rdquo; and &ldquo;esthetic&rdquo; values of the environment means. The scope of what constitutes &ldquo;public natural resources&rdquo; also remains largely unexplored. Questions remain as to the nature of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s duty to act affirmatively to protect the environment by passing laws. Few cases have delved deeply into the question of what &ldquo;prudence, loyalty, and impartiality&rdquo; look like in the context of preserving and maintaining public natural resources. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not elaborated on the proper approach to balancing the rights guaranteed by the ERA with other legitimate government interests like promoting economic development, and it is unknown whether it will approve of the two-part test created by the Commonwealth Court in Frederick Township.&nbsp;</p>

The State of Solar Development in PA: Solar Energy Benefits Remain Unrealized,,"<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Citizens/solar/Pages/default.aspx"">Pennsylvania&nbsp;Department of Environmental Protection</a>, solar energy currently contributes less than 1 percent of the state&rsquo;s total electricity generation. Despite overall <a href=""https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/pennsylvania-solar"">increases across the state</a>, slow solar growth in PA does not align with the rapidly declining costs of installation,<a href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics""> available tax credits</a>, and myriad health benefits of prioritizing solar over fossil fuels. There are more reasons than ever to act quickly to secure Pennsylvanians&rsquo; economic, environmental, and social wellbeing, all of which would be augmented by increased deployment of solar energy.&nbsp;</p>

	<li>The reuse, recycling and decommissioning of solar panels is feasible and sustainable. Many panels will continue to generate electricity long after a system is decommissioned and can be used in other applications. When it is time to retire the panels, <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/Solar%20Energy%20Supply%20Chain%20Report%20-%20Final.pdf"">90% of their&nbsp; components are recyclable</a> with current technology, which is continually improving.</li>

<p>In addition to the threats posed by solar myths, solar development in PA also faces more concrete legislative obstacles. Bills currently awaiting action in the PA legislature could further solidify the state&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels, prevent local efforts to incentivize solar, and burden solar development with greater bonding requirements than dirtier industries. Pennsylvania also lacks bills that strengthen solar access; to combat this issue, lawmakers should enable community solar and <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-Misguided-Homeowner-Association-Restrictions-Block-Pennsylvanias-Solar-Potential"">curtail HOA solar restrictions</a>.</p>

<h3><span style=""color:#696969;"">Move Forward from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Legacy of Dirty Energy and Polluted Air</span></h3>

<p>Solar energy offers a key opportunity to <a href=""https://www.pennfuture.org/Blog-Item-What-We-Learned-from-the-December-2022-Deep-Freeze-Dont-Rely-on-Natural-Gas-When-Its-Fracking-Cold-Part-1."">enhance the security of our energy grid</a>, create <a href=""https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/82213.pdf"">thousands of jobs</a>, <a href=""https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy07osti/41998.pdf"">improve air quality, and reduce health impacts</a> caused by fossil fuel emissions.</p>

<p><strong>Policy Recommendations:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pennsylvania should increase its solar energy goals through higher Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) targets. The previous AEPS solar goal (0.5% of the 8% renewable energy goal) was attained in 2021, and a more ambitious target is needed. PennFuture supports <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&amp;SPick=20230&amp;cosponId=40010"">PA Senate Bill 230</a>, which would increase the renewable energy goal to 30% by 2030 and permit community solar.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania must encourage solar power development on brownfields and through use of agrivoltaics. The state has plenty of space for solar, especially since solar is a more preferable investment for farms than permanent-conversation developments. Additionally, the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation has found that there are more than <a href=""http://epcamr.org/storage/Abandoned_Mine_Land_Pgm_Fact_Sheet.pdf"">200,000 acres of abandoned mine land in PA</a>, which could potentially host solar farms.</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania needs to implement legislation supporting residential solar access, community solar, and more equitable bonding requirements. Rather than perpetuating the dominance of polluting fossil fuels, PA lawmakers must instead focus on pro-solar policies that will yield greater long-term advantages for their constituents.</li>
</ul>

<p>PennFuture continues its work promoting clean energy and a sustainable future for all Pennsylvanians. Solar energy is undoubtedly a crucial climate solution that is more affordable than ever. Continued solar restrictions, limited funding for renewable infrastructure, and subsidies for dirty energy are simply illogical and are doing a disservice to future generations.</p>
