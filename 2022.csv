Delaware River Basin Commission’s New Fracking Regulations Mark Incremental Progress,12/27/2022,"<p>This month, the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) finalized regulations banning the discharge of fracking wastewater within the basin. Additionalregulations regardthe import and export of water for fracking purposes outside of the Delaware watershed.</p>

<p>DRBC seems to have at last heeded<a href=""/Files/Admin/2022-02-28-PennFuture-Comments-DRBC-Fracking-Wastewater-Ban.pdf"">calls from PennFuture</a>and others thatfinal regulations needed to be tightened,closingloopholes that had allowed fracking wastewater and byproducts to potentially harm the basin.</p>

<p>DRBC&rsquo;s regulations clearly recognize that fracking wastewater is so toxic that it poses &ldquo;significant, immediate and long-term risks&rdquo; to water resources.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a rundown on what this all means for the Delaware River Basin&rsquo;s environment and for the communities that rely upon its water supplies.</p>

<p><strong>Where does fracking stand in the Delaware River Basin?</strong></p>

<p>Fracking is banned! Following on the heels of a decade-long de facto moratorium on fracking and all fracking-related activities, the <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fracking-Banned-in-Delaware-River-Basin"">DRBC banned fracking in the Delaware River Basin in 2021</a>. This ban protects our water resources and our communities from the known dangers from the physical act of fracking!</p>

<p><strong>But what about fracking wastewater?</strong></p>

<p>Well, that depends. The DRBC&rsquo;s final regulations prohibiting the &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; of fracking wastewater is great news. The final regulations add clarity to the<a href=""/Blog-Item-DRBC-Proposed-Regulations-Ban-Discharge-of-Fracking-Wastewater-Discourages-Fracking-Related-Interbasin-Water-Transfers"">October 2021 draft regulations </a>that ban fracking wastewater and byproducts such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Road spreading of fracking wastewater</li>
	<li>Injection of fracking wastewater into deep well for storage/disposal</li>
	<li>Disposal of fracking wastewater in landfills</li>
	<li>Discharge of leachate from landfills that accept fracking waste, including after treatment</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, the DRBC clarified that &ldquo;wastewater&rdquo; includes wastewater, brine, and sludge that contains fracking contaminates, even if that wastewater was treated. The Commission also made explicit that the discharge ban includes any type of discharge, whether on land or directly into the waters, and whether intentional or unintentional.</p>

<p><strong>What about risks from transporting fracking wastewater?</strong></p>

<p>The DRBC&rsquo;s final regulations still allow for the transport, storage, transfer, process, and reuse of fracking wastewater within the basin, which carry with them the possibility of spills and leakage that could irreparably damage the Delaware&rsquo;s water resources.</p>

<p>The DRBC anticipates &ldquo;only low volumes&rdquo; of fracking wastewater to be transported to or through the Basin, arguing that this reduces the &ldquo;number of probable spills.&rdquo; <a href=""/Blog-Item-New-Report-Details-the-Use-of-Forever-Chemicals-in-Fracking-Operations-Despite-Serious-Concerns-to-Public-Health"">Fracking wastewater is highly toxic</a>. DRBC&rsquo;s regulations, therefore, do not seem to be stringent enough to protect the heath of our communities or our environment. Despite our knowledge of how harmful this wastewater is, there are still many potentially toxic components which we still don&rsquo;t know about.</p>

<p>As a way to alleviate these concerns, the DRBC has argued that there is a &ldquo;high bar&rdquo; for approval of any importation of wastewater into the basin. To that end, PennFuture will be diligent in monitoring any applications to the DRBC regarding the importation of fracking wastewater into the basin to ensure that the Commission adheres to its duty to protect the Delaware from harm.</p>

<p><strong>What about the use of Delaware River Basin water for fracking outside of the basin?</strong></p>

<p>The DRBC refused to ban or limit the use of basin water for fracking activities elsewhere. Instead, the Commission argued that its current regulations of the expiration of water should be stringent enough to protect the watershed from over-extraction of water.</p>

<p>DRBC has argued that an application for water exportation by a fracking company is highly unlikely to meet the standards and requirements to merit a permit. The Commission&rsquo;s duty through this review is to ensure, by evaluating a series of factors, that there is &ldquo;no harm&rdquo; to the basin&rsquo;s water resources.</p>

<p>We are hopeful that the DRBC will adhere strictly to its duty and regulations and reject any water exportation request that does not meet these stringent standards&mdash;regardless of whether it&rsquo;s for fracking or any other activity outside the Basin.</p>

<p>In conclusion, these final fracking wastewater regulations are very much an improvement over the<a href=""/Blog-Item-Public-Comment-Closes-on-DRBC-Fracking-Regulations"">regulations originally drafted in 2018</a>. PennFuture fully supports the clear prohibition of discharges of fracking wastewater within the Delaware River Basin, as well as DRBC&rsquo;s efforts to clarify and strengthen that prohibition following recent public comment.</p>

<p>While we are unhappy that there still remain opportunities for fracking wastewater to be brought into the Basin&mdash;and with it the potential to irreparably harm our waters and communities&mdash;we are hopeful that the DRBC will do everything in its power to minimize those potential harms.</p>

PennFuture and Partners Convince EPA to Upgrade Delaware River Water Quality Standards,12/20/2022,"<p>Back in April, PennFuture and our partners filed a petition to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), requesting a new water quality standard for dissolved oxygen for the urban stretch of the Delaware River. On December 1, the EPA took the rare step and granted our petition!</p>

<p>While it might sound like a technical issue, this is a major development for our continued efforts to upgrade and protect the Delaware River estuary&mdash;the 38-mile stretch of the river from Trenton to the top of the Delaware Bay.</p>

<p>The petition raised critical questions surrounding what defines &ldquo;existing use&rdquo; of this stretch of the river and how data-driven evidence demonstrates that existing use. The problem here is that there is solid evidence that fish propagation is occurring in this section of the river. This evidence of an &ldquo;existing use&rdquo; formed the basis for our petition to EPA to upgrade the designated use to include propagation of fish.</p>

<p>As we explain below, PennFuture and our partners had petitioned the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) years ago to recognize the propagation of fish and set appropriate standards to protect it. However, DRBC, the intergovernmental agency responsible for water quality protections in the Delaware River watershed, has failed to act on our petition in a timely manner. And so the time had come for us to petition EPA to step in and take control to protect the river under their overarching authority under the federal Clean Water Act.</p>

<p><strong>The law.</strong>The federal Clean Water Act requires that regulators determine the &ldquo;existing use&rdquo; of a waterbody and establish a &ldquo;designated use&rdquo; that matches or goes beyond the existing use. At the moment, the designated use&mdash;with regard to aquatic life&mdash;is defined as &ldquo;maintenance of resident fish and other aquatic life&rdquo; and &ldquo;passage for migratory fish.&rdquo; The currently applicable standards, in these zones of the River, do not include protections to provide for the &ldquo;propagation of fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The science.</strong> Based on the &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; designated use, the DRBC set a dissolved oxygen standard of 3.5 mg/L. Dissolved oxygen is required to support aquatic life. Yet pollution from industry, insufficiently treated sewage from wastewater plants, and the pollution carried to the river from our streets during rain events can have dramatic impacts on the ecosystem. High levels of pollution adversely affect aquatic habitats, potentially causing harmful algal blooms, which deprive the river of oxygen and create dead zones for other life. And the more sensitive juvenile fish populations that are present in areas where propagation of fish occur need a higher level of dissolved oxygen than those areas where only maintenance of adult populations is needed. Upgrading the designated use of this section of the river should result in the creation of higher dissolved oxygen standards necessary to protect all live stages of fish.</p>

<p><strong>The evidence</strong>. Federally-protected Atlantic Sturgeon can be found in this stretch of the river&mdash;living and spawning, not just migrating through&mdash;and therefore need a higher dissolved oxygen standard in order to survive. The argument is simple. The fish are existing there, and this &ldquo;existing use&rdquo; by the sturgeon needs to be recognized by law.</p>

<p>This issue has been brewing for years. In 2013, Delaware Riverkeeper Network (DRN) and other organizations submitted an initial petition to the DRBC, urging it to recognize the emerging data that fish are now spawning in all zones of the Delaware Estuary. In 2021, DRN, PennFuture and others filed a supplemental petition with the DRBC, pointing to additional evidence of fish propagation and urging DRBC to move faster.</p>

<p>PennFuture and our partners remain frustrated with the DRBC&rsquo;s delay and inaction. PennFuture, DRN, and others filed a petition to the EPA in April, requesting:</p>

<ul>
	<li>EPA issue a rule that revises the designated uses for these urban zones to include a) maintenance and propagation of resident fish and other aquatic life, and b) spawning and nursery habitat for anadromous fish</li>
	<li>EPA upgrade the dissolved oxygen standard from 3.5 mg/L to 6/3 mg/L</li>
</ul>

<p>On December 1, EPA granted the petition for rulemaking and set out a 12-month timeline for establishing new water quality standards for dissolved oxygen in this part of the Delaware. In making this determination, EPA found that &ldquo;&lsquo;propagation of fish&rsquo;&rdquo; is &ldquo;attainable&rdquo; and that the &ldquo;currently applicable dissolved oxygen criterion for these zones is not sufficient to protect propagation.&rdquo; EPA determined, in other words, that the dissolved oxygen standard needs to be higher.</p>

<p>Still to be determined is exactly what that higher standard will be. EPA expects to release draft regulations by 2024, which will be addressed in the years thereafter by the DRBC and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), as well as the environmental agencies of New Jersey and Delaware. The higher water quality standards will then be implemented by upgrading wastewater treatment plants along the estuary as well as by creating more stringent permits for polluters along the river. Fortunately, significant increases in state and federal infrastructure funding could, in part, be used for these wastewater treatment plant upgrades.</p>

<p>PennFuture is committed to ensure the Delaware River&rsquo;s new standards will protect the survival of the sturgeon as well as the health of other aquatic life in the basin. Millions of residents use the Delaware River for recreation, food, and work. Our goal is to make sure that they will be able to do so for years to come.</p>

Distribution Centers Bring into Focus Limitations of Local Zoning Laws,11/2/2022,"<p>Northeast Pennsylvania&rsquo;s growing proliferation of large-scale distribution centers is threatening the high-quality waterways of the Pocono Mountains. This region is home to a high concentration of special protection streams &ndash; some of the healthiest waters in the state &ndash; and serves as the headwaters of the Delaware River. While High Quality and Exceptional Value waters do receive legal protection, irresponsible and poorly sited development projects can still cause degradation when local land use policies fail to uphold these protections.</p>

<p>The approval process for land use projects can be cumbersome and difficult to follow, but a recent decision made by local officials in Monroe County provides an excellent example of why paying close attention to zoning ordinances can be advantageous. On October 26, the Coolbaugh Township Zoning Hearing Board voted unanimously to deny a special exception for a 426,000-square-foot distribution center. The project was pitched as a &quot;warehouse&quot; and proposed for a 48-acre tract of land located in a commercial district. While warehouses are a permitted use in this district as a special exception, &ldquo;distribution centers&rdquo; are not, and the developer did not demonstrate that it adhered to the definition of a warehouse. The township had thoughtful zoning on the books. Applying these zoning ordinances ensured that the proposed use was appropriately sited.</p>

<p>First, some background on zoning practices. While municipalities in Pennsylvania must legally allow for every &quot;use&quot; within its borders, zoning districts determine where those uses are located. Districts include but are not limited to commercial, industrial, residential, and open space. Within those districts, municipal officials can list which uses are automatically allowed, which are not allowed, and which require a special exemption that will need to meet conditions placed on the project by officials.</p>

<p>Initial zoning ordinances did not anticipate the large-scale industrial nature of distribution centers, which are vastly different from what was considered a &quot;warehouse&quot; 10, 20, 50 years ago. This means that warehouses and distribution centers are likely no longer appropriate uses in commercial or village districts, as they were previously considered.</p>

<p>It is critical to note the distinction made in the zoning ordinance between warehouses and distribution centers. Essentially, a warehouse is designed for the indoor storage, transfer, and distribution of goods, but crucially, it does not include a truck terminal. Meanwhile, a distribution center receives, stores, and distributes goods. This definition includes the redistribution and consolidation of orders, as well as the storage, parking, and servicing of trucks. The distinction is clear. While the township did not decide that the proposed project was a distribution center, they did determine that the applicant failed to show that it was a warehouse.</p>

<p>In short, the Coolbaugh Township Zoning Hearing Board&rsquo;s decision last month utilized the tools it had under its zoning ordinance to ensure that this type of large-scale industrial development was appropriately sited in the township.</p>

<p>This is a critical victory for special protection streams in the Poconos. Had the Coolbaugh project moved forward, stormwater on the property would have naturally flowed into the Tobyhanna, a High Quality creek, increasing the likelihood of degradation. Thermal impacts and contamination from salt and chemicals carried by stormwater runoff can create a potentially toxic environment for wildlife. Additionally, the paved surface of parking lots also generally increases and speeds up the flow of runoff into streams, leading to more frequent and severe flooding events.</p>

<p>Unless municipalities take a watershed-wide approach to land use, industrial development risks causing &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot; to local waterways. Long-lasting and devastating impacts are magnified when one distribution center turns into many. Just a single 300,000-square-foot distribution center can cause long-lasting negative impacts on the environment through stormwater pollution. But consider the massive impact of several of these projects in a condensed area.</p>

<p>For example, in Pocono and Jackson Township, there are upwards of four warehouses being proposed, totalling over 1.5 million square feet, all within a few miles of each other and some projects proposed on adjacent properties. Our streams will not be all that suffers from this onslaught as neighboring homes and businesses will have to contend with air pollution, noise pollution, light pollution, and traffic impacts. While one distribution center may make sense in a properly sited industrial zone, it is less sensible to develop several all within a commercial zone bordering homes or special protection streams. When municipalities review their zoning ordinances, the cumulative impacts of multiple large-scale projects must be considered because the harm caused to the environment and surrounding communities becomes exponential.</p>

<p>County-wide or multi-municipality planning and zoning could provide for just this type of holistic approach to warehouse and distribution center development. If the zoning issues in the Poconos are not addressed, this region known for clean water, clean air, open space, and outdoor recreation will be unrecognizable as it evolves into a busy industrial zone with poor air quality, degraded streams, and traffic congestion.</p>

<p>Coolbaugh Township was lucky to have &ndash; and apply &ndash; zoning that recognized these issues. Similarly, Pocono Township is attempting to be responsive to the threat by beginning the curative amendment process to fix problems with its zoning related to distribution centers and warehouses.</p>

<p><a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.wordpress.com/2022/05/11/pocono-residents-support-more-action-to-protect-exceptional-value-streams-new-poll-finds/"">More than 98 percent of Pocono residents </a>believe that more must be done to protect local waterways from large-scale commercial and industrial development.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, &quot;we all live downstream.&quot; It is not just the immediate community and ecosystem that will experience the consequences of development-fueled degradation. Neighboring communities and even those that live miles downstream will feel the impact. Our pristine Pocono streams protect the quality of drinking water for 13 million people that live downstream, and they also contribute to the health of the regions outdoor recreation economy. These outstanding waters must be considered when making consequential land use decisions.</p>

<p>The proliferation of distribution centers provides municipal officials reason to take a more holistic approach toward theirzoning ordinances. They have widespread support among residents, who have been showing up to meetings in droves, demanding action. Our local leaders have the tools at their fingertips. Now is the time to act before its too late.</p>

Erie’s Stormwater Fee Program Becomes Reality,10/19/2022,"<p>TodayErie City Council passed a much-anticipated stormwater user fee. The fee creates a dedicated fund for long-overdue stormwater maintenance and, more importantly, for stormwater-management improvements that bring environmental, economic, and human health benefits.</p>

<p>Six major streams wind their way through the City of Erie. All are deemed &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; under the Clean Water Act due to excessive sediment pollution caused by runoff. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection requires the city to reduce these sediments by 10 percent over five years by implementing a <a href=""https://cityof.erie.pa.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Erie-PRP-2022-Final-Draft-updated-5-11-22-rev1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pollutant Reduction Plan (PRP).</a> A stormwater engineer was recently hired by the city, with plans to fund the position over the long term using revenue from the stormwater fee.</p>

<p>Stormwater funding aimed at capital improvements will promote public safety and ultimately save money. Over the past 70 years, Erie experienced <a href=""https://glisa.umich.edu/climate-change-in-the-great-lakes-region-references/"" target=""_blank"">a more than 10-percent increase in total annual precipitation</a> and a 35-percent increase in the amount of precipitation during heavy storms. Recently, the City experienced significant flooding after more than <a href=""https://www.goerie.com/story/news/local/2022/09/28/erie-pa-sets-rainfall-record-for-sept-27-reports-flooded-roads-creeks/69523245007/"" target=""_blank"">2.5 rapid inches of rainfall</a> fell on the region. Past massive storms led to the <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/flooded-erie-home-2-dead/"" target=""_blank"">drowning of two people in 2017 </a>and emergency infrastructure failures, such as the East Fifth Street storm sewer failure in 2021, which <a href=""https://www.goerie.com/story/news/local/2021/09/01/garrison-run-east-erie-storm-sewer-failure-cost-least-1-2-m-infrastructure-stormwater/5654320001/"" target=""_blank"">cost the city over $1.2 million for repairs</a>. With over 500 miles of stormwater infrastructure, a significant portion of which is over a century old, the city needs this dedicated fee funding to protect all residents and businesses.</p>

<p>Creation of the fee program also directly aligns with recommendations in <a href=""/Files/Admin/ErieCommonAgenda_6.pdf""><em>Our Water, Our Future: A Common Agenda for Protecting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Lake Erie Watershed</em></a>. In collaboration with other area environmental organizations, PennFuture determined pollution caused by surface runoff, including urban stormwater runoff, to be the largest direct threat to our regional water quality. Recommended strategies to mitigate this threat at the local level include creation of a multi-municipal stormwater authority and a county-wide stormwater fee. Though scaled down from the <em>Common Agenda</em>&rsquo;s proposal, we support Mayor Joseph Schember&rsquo;s decision to advocate for a fee.</p>

<p>Collaboration across state, county, and local entities was critical to advance the stormwater fee. In 2019, the City&rsquo;s consultants recommended adoption of a stormwater fee as one strategy to combat the city&rsquo;s financial vulnerability. The DEP&rsquo;s Office of the Great Lakes, Erie County Department of Planning and Community Development, City of Erie, and Millcreek Township then worked together to obtain funding for a 2021 feasibility study of stormwater fees for the county&rsquo;s two largest municipalities. An expert stormwater program consultancy, Wood Consulting, who notably assisted in the development of nearby Meadville&rsquo;s fee in 2012, was contracted to complete the study. Though Millcreek Township elected to not yet enact a fee after the conclusion of the feasibility study, the city opted to move forward with a fee ordinance.</p>

<p>The resulting proposed fee structure is built upon the same foundation outlined in PennFuture&rsquo;s <a href=""/Files/Admin/PennFuture_StormwaterManual_web_3.20.17.pdf"">Model Stormwater Management Fee Ordinance (2017)</a>. Both ordinances charge a stormwater user fee to all property owners, regardless of taxable status, based on their property&rsquo;s amount of impervious surface area. The fee structure relies on the concept of an &ldquo;equivalent residential unit&rdquo; representing the average impervious surface area of a residential tax parcel. Once the ERU is calculated, the desired revenue from the annual fee is divided by the estimated total count of ERUs across the City to determine the fee per ERU. For non-residential properties, ERUs are totaled and billed accordingly. In many other municipalities, residential property owners are all charged a fee of one ERU, regardless of how much impervious surface they have. However, the city sought to make costs more equitable for residential payers by creating three payment tiers based on housing footprints. As a result, residential payers will only pay between $12 and $36 per year. In a comparison of other fees across Pennsylvania, the <a href=""https://cityof.erie.pa.us/stormwater/"" target=""_blank"">City of Erie&rsquo;s low residential costs stand out.</a> The city has pledged to not raise fees for five years.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.goerie.com/story/news/local/2021/12/01/no-erie-pa-stormwater-fee-now-city-council-rejects-proposal/8808404002/"" target=""_blank"">Council rejected a fee ordinance with a 4-3 vote in late 2021</a>, citing a lack of sufficient detail. Stormwater fee programs often allow utility payers to reduce their annual fee (i.e. obtain &ldquo;credits&rdquo;) by implementing best management practices to mitigate volume and/or rate of runoff from their properties. In response, Wood Consulting and the city administration have since crafted a fee credit policy with input from a 12-member Stormwater Credit Advisory Committee. The resulting credit policy, presented to Council ahead of a second attempt to enact a fee, allows for a generous 45 percent maximum credit for commercial and institutional fee payers. PennFuture and our partners support this new credit policy and are glad that it ultimately received the support of Council.</p>

<p>Erie now joins <a href=""https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=seas_faculty_pubs"" target=""_blank"">over three dozen Pennsylvania municipalities collecting stormwater fees,</a> including counterparts in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Allentown, Lancaster, Bethlehem, and nearby Meadville. As outlined in the Our Water, Our Future Campaign, stormwater fees provide capacity to tackle a primary source of pollution in our watershed: urban stormwater runoff. We applaud City Council for its decision to approve the stormwater fee ordinance, following through on the recommendations and efforts of so many stakeholders, including PennFuture and our partners.</p>

The Clean Water Act’s 50-Year Impact on Pennsylvania,10/18/2022,"<p>As we<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/17/a-proclamation-on-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-clean-water-act/"" target=""_blank""> celebrate 50 years</a> of the groundbreaking Clean Water Act, I&rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to reflect on what it means to PennFuture, Pennsylvanians, and our over 86,000 miles of streams.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has a long history of polluted waterways, due in major part to our economy&rsquo;s historical reliance on extractive industries. In particular, coal mining&rsquo;stoxic legacy remains the leading cause for the on-goingimpairment of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters. More than <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/OurCommonWealth/Pages/Article.aspx?post=92"" target=""_blank"">5,550 miles of streams</a> are still impacted by acid mine drainage from abandoned coal mines.</p>

<p>Extractive industries continue to damage Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways. In particular, the fracking industry has <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/dimock/"" target=""_blank"">recklessly polluted</a> streams and groundwater across the state &ndash; through the<a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-fracking-gas-drilling-tainted-water-dimock-criminal-case-20220218.html"" target=""_blank""> fracking process itself</a> or through construction of <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/mariner-east-builder-sunoco-agrees-to-4m-settlement-over-marsh-creek-lake-spill/"" target=""_blank"">pipeline infrastructure</a>.</p>

<p>As far back as 1905, the Purity of Waters Act set limits on how much sewage could be added to the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters. And yet, even from the beginning, some of the largest water polluters - namely coal mines and tanneries - were specifically exempted from this law. As water pollution continued to worsen, Pennsylvania enacted the Clean Streams Law in 1937 to strengthen discharge limits and to increase coverage and penalties. And yet still, coal mines were exempted from this law. Nor did the Clean Streams Law require restoration of degraded waterways. In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t until significant amendments in 1945 that the Clean Streams Law included discharges from coal mines and required the industry to develop and implement a plan for reducing these toxic discharges from fouling our waters.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, despite these rules, enforcement remained lackluster. The number of polluted streams continued to increase as industrial activity overtook our waters. This led the Clean Streams Law to be amended again in 1965, significantly strengthening the regulation of water pollution discharges &ndash; specifically for coal mines &ndash; while requiring that polluters restore degraded waters and attempt to prevent their degradation in the first place. And yet our waterways still suffered.</p>

<p>Eventually, the federal government recognized that states were ill equipped to prevent water pollution. Rather than rely on a patchwork quilt of water protection laws at the state level, on October 18, 1972, the Clean Water Act (officially the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972) was signed into law (over President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s veto).</p>

<p>This groundbreaking law set forth the goal to &ldquo;restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation&rsquo;s waters.&rdquo; Focused on discharges of pollution from point sources into waters of the United States, the Clean Water Act (CWA) aimed to prevent, reduce, and eliminate water pollution through the development of water quality standards and limitations set forth in permits. Critically, the CWA imposes the concept of &ldquo;antidegradation&rdquo; into the regulatory scheme, meaning that once a waterway reaches a level of water quality,<a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/AboutDEP/Testimony/Pennsylvania%20Joint%20Letter%20on%20WOTUS.pdf"" target=""_blank""> that level cannot be degraded</a>. The federal backstop created by the CWA is especially important for states like Pennsylvania where some of our most ecologically sensitive and economically important streams and creeks are all too often polluted with no regard to the value &ndash; or &ldquo;use&rdquo; &ndash; of those waters.</p>

<p>Although the CWA was hopeful that we would meet these laudable goals by 1985, we are still struggling to protect and restore our waters today. That is not to say that the CWA has not been successful; it most certainly has. We no longer have <a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444/"" target=""_blank"">burning rivers </a>and many of our rivers have seen a resurgence in aquatic life once struggling on the brink of extinction. People no longer turn their backs to the rivers and creeks that once provided so much recreational and economic opportunities for our communities. The CWA has significantly reduced raw sewage from being directly dumped into our waters. We have more &ldquo;fishable and swimmable&rdquo; waters than we did 50 years ago!</p>

<p>But the problem is clearly bigger than anticipated, and with the CWA failing to regulate most non-point source discharges (e.g., stormwater runoff) and groundwater, there are regulatory holes that allow for water pollution and degradation to continue. (Good news: the Clean Streams Law covers groundwater!) With developers and industry continuing to challenge the applicability of the CWA (<a href=""/Blog-Item-Reasons-to-Remain-Hopeful-as-Supreme-Court-Rules-on-Clean-Water-Acts-Future"">heres the latest example</a>), the constantly uphill battle can often seem overwhelming for environmentalists and conservationists.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most important components of the CWA is how the law allowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the Chesapeake Bay in 2010. Imposition of a TMDL (think of it as a &ldquo;pollution diet&rdquo;) was necessary to prevent pollution and clean up the Bay after decades of sediment and nutrient pollution took it to the brink. These pollutants are primarily from wastewater and non-point source runoff, resulting in murky waters and harmful algae blooms that threaten aquatic vegetation and organisms, while lowering the dissolved oxygen levels that are critical for the survival of aquatic life.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed TMDL means that pollution inputs on the Susquehanna River &ndash; the main tributary to the Bay &ndash; must be significantly cut, improving water quality for Pennsylvanians as well as downstream communities. Recognizing this benefit to the water quality of one of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s largest river systems, PennFuture has worked to support efforts to reduce pollution to the Susquehanna River. When agricultural interests initially challenged the Bay TMDL in federal court, <a href=""https://www.courthousenews.com/epa-prevails-in-fight-over-chesapeake-bay/"" target=""_blank"">PennFuture successfully intervened to support EPA</a>. And yet, <a href=""/chesapeakebay"">Pennsylvania is failing to meet these TMDL goals</a>. And so we lobby in Harrisburg for <a href=""/Files/Admin/Final-Chesapeake-report.pdf"">funding for pollution reduction programs</a> and press for robust water quality protections in permits and agency programs.</p>

<p>Today, PennFuture continues to wrestle with protecting and restoring the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters, and we are grateful that the CWA is there along the way, supporting our efforts. CWA has allowed for Pennsylvania to enact stronger state laws that protect water quality, protecting those state laws from legislative rollbacks. Our attorneys rely on the CWA in defending our waters and enforcing against polluters. And when the jurisdiction of the CWA has been threatened over the years, <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/AboutDEP/Testimony/Pennsylvania%20Joint%20Letter%20on%20WOTUS.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pennsylvania has stepped up</a> in calling for robust protections at the federal level.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is lucky to have both tens of thousands of miles of streams and robust water protection laws. However, without enactment of the CWA 50 years ago, our history of allowing industries to pollute those waters could have undermined the overall health of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s waters.

Upholding the True Meaning of Pennsylvania’s Environmental Rights Amendment,10/12/2022,"<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recently handed down a decision upholding the ban on fracking in the Delaware River basin.</p>

<p>The decision is the latest in a series of legal disputes over the state&rsquo;s constitutional protections for the Delaware River &mdash; and all waterways throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Back in February 2021, after a lengthy de facto moratorium, the Delaware River Basin Commission officially issued regulations <a href=""/Blog-Item-Fracking-Banned-in-Delaware-River-Basin"">banning fracking </a>in the basin in February 2021. (Some parts of this regulation relating to wastewater and water transfers remain to be finalized.)</p>

<p>Some members of our Pennsylvania legislature, acting as individual legislators and not on behalf of the whole legislature, brought a challenge in federal court, asserting that they were legally harmed by the fracking ban and asking the court to overturn it. PennFuture and a number of our partner organizations are particularly concerned about the legislators&rsquo; argument that they are trustees of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s public natural resources under our Environmental Rights Amendment, and that they have a duty to increase the value of the trust by fracking. We strongly disagree and, earlier this year, filed a brief with the federal district court explaining that the ERA in no way supports the legislators&rsquo; arguments.</p>

<p>Fortunately the district court <a href=""/Blog-Item-Federal-Court-Dismissed-Lawsuit-Challenging-DRBCs-Ban-on-Fracking"">agreed </a>and dismissed the legislators&rsquo; case for lack of standing, finding that the legislators did not have an actual legal injury upon which to make a claim.</p>

<p>The legislators appealed to the Third Circuit, and again PennFuture and our partners filed an amicus brief to set the record straight on the ERA. We explained that the individual legislators were not trustees under the ERA, and even if they were, trustees would not be under a duty to frack. Instead, we explained, the ERA requires that trustees conserve and maintain trust assets, including the water resources of the Delaware River basin.</p>

<p>The Third Circuit agreed, issuing an <a href=""https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/212315p.pdf"" target=""_blank"">opinion </a>that affirmed the district court&rsquo;s dismissal of the legislators&rsquo; claims. First the Court found that the individual legislators lacked standing to assert institutional injuries belonging to the legislature as a whole. The Court wrote that the legislators&rsquo; claims are &ldquo;classic examples of institutional injuries because they sound in a general loss of legislative power.&rdquo; Moreover, the legislators, as individuals, were not authorized to represent the interests of those institutions in court. If the legislature or the Commonwealth as a whole were injured, the Attorney General would be the party for representing the Commonwealth, not individual legislators.</p>

<p>The Court also addressed the argument that the legislators had standing to challenge the ban as trustees of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s natural resources under the ERA. The court found this &ldquo;legally creative&rdquo; but that it &ldquo;falls short.&rdquo; The Court, referring to our brief, agreed with us that the legislators&rsquo; view of the ERA would &ldquo;turn it upside down.&rdquo; The ERA trust is not a &ldquo;run-of-the-mill financial trust in which the trustees have a duty to maximize profits.&rdquo; Instead, the trust must &ldquo;conserve and maintain&rdquo; our public natural resources. The Court engaged in an analysis of trust responsibilities and concluded that &ldquo;the ban promotes the purposes of the trust and protects its corpus&rdquo; by preventing our public natural resources from being depleted.</p>

<p>The ERA is one of the most important tools that Pennsylvanians have to defend against exploitation of our natural resources and ensure that future generations will be able to breathe pure air and enjoy clean water. We will continue to fight - even against our own legislators when we need to - to defend the rights that the ERA guarantees to the people of the Commonwealth.</p>

Reasons to Remain Hopeful as Supreme Court Rules on Clean Water Act’s Future,10/4/2022,"<p>On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the federal Clean Water Act, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument on the case of <i>Sackett v. EPA</i>, which has the very likely potential to severely curtail the types of waters that are automatically protected by the Act.</p>

<p>The Clean Water Act (CWA or the Act) &ldquo;restore[s] and maintain[s] the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nations&rsquo; waters&rdquo; by asserting jurisdiction over &ldquo;waters of the United States&rdquo; (often referred to as WOTUS). At issue before the Supreme Court is what is included in the definition of WOTUS&mdash;which waters are &ldquo;jurisdictional&rdquo; and therefore protected by the CWA. In particular the Court was focused on when and whether wetlands are covered by the Act.</p>

<p>WOTUS could perhaps be the most hotly contested CWA issue over the past 50 years. This issue has been a battle before the Supreme Court <a href=""https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/2022/06/sackett-v-epa-and-the-definition-of-waters-of-the-united-states/"" style=""text-decoration-line: none;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(5, 99, 193); font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">three times</span></a><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> already and each of the past three presidential administrations have come out with </span><a href=""https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/2017/09/defining-waters-of-the-united-states-clean-water-rule/"" style=""text-decoration-line: none;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(5, 99, 193); font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">multiple rules</span></a><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> defining WOTUS. Yet we still don&rsquo;t have a clear rule.</span></p>

<p>This is mostly because there was a 4-1-4 split at the Supreme Court in the 2006 case of <span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Rapanos v. EPA</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">. This means that there were two competing tests for jurisdiction: Justice Scalia&rsquo;s &ldquo;continuous surface connection&rdquo; test, which would restrict jurisdiction to only those wetlands that that have a physical surface connection to waters; and Justice Kennedy&rsquo;s &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; test which recognized that wetlands impact water quality of hydrologically connected waters, even if that connection is below the surface. With no clear rule set forth by the Supreme Court, subsequent lower court decisions disagreed on how to apply the law, with most courts agreeing that Justice Kennedy&rsquo;s significant nexus test is a minimum for jurisdiction, but no court holding that a water is jurisdictional only if it meets Justice Scalia&rsquo;s &ldquo;continuous surface connection&rdquo; test.</span></p>

<p>The Sackettfamily have already been in front of the Supreme Court on just this issue. In 2004, Michael and Chantell Sackett bought a piece of property near Priest Lake in Idaho that was previously defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a jurisdictional wetland. Because of that, the couple was prevented from filling in the wetland without a CWA permit to build a house. The couple sued EPA, arguing that the CWA didn&rsquo;t apply to their property because it wasn&rsquo;t a WOTUS; the case made its way to the Supreme Court on procedural issues and was remanded to the District Court, which in 2019 upheld EPA&rsquo;s determination that the wetland was jurisdictional under the &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; test (the wetlands were adjacent to and had a subsurface connection to a navigable body of water).</p>

<p>The case presently before the Supreme Court asks &ldquo;whether the [federal Court of Appeals] set forth the proper test for determining whether wetlands are &lsquo;waters of the United States&rsquo; under the Clean Water Act.&rdquo; Essentially, the Sacketts are asking the court to reject the significant nexus test in favor of the more limiting &ldquo;continuous surface connection&rdquo; test offered by Justice Scalia. In fact, they are asking the Court to apply an even-more stringent two-part test that would go further than even Justice Scalia in <span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Rapanos.</span></p>

<p>Over the past decade, EPA, state agencies, and many of the federal courts across the country have been applying the significant nexus test as the appropriate and scientifically-supported method for determining CWA jurisdiction. There has been much litigation over the agencies&rsquo; proposed WOTUS rules in that time, something that we don&rsquo;t have to time to go into in this blog post (but see <a href=""/Blog-Item-New-Definition-of-Waters-of-the-United-States-Threatens-Clean-Water-Act-Protections"" style=""text-decoration-line: none;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(5, 99, 193); font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> if you&rsquo;re curious). Suffice it to say, no administration and no agency has ever thought a test as limiting as the one presently offered by the Sacketts was an appropriate test &ndash; not even the previous administration&rsquo;s </span><a href=""/Blog-Item-New-Definition-of-Waters-of-the-United-States-Threatens-Clean-Water-Act-Protections"" style=""text-decoration-line: none;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(5, 99, 193); font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">proposed rule</span></a><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> that so severely curtailed the jurisdiction of the CWA that it was labeled the &ldquo;Dirty Water Rule.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m not one to read tea leaves of the Supreme Court, overall, the justices seemed disinclined to wholesale reject that &ldquo;wetlands&rdquo; are clearly within the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. The focus of the questioning was around the term &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; as it applied to wetlands, both as it is read in Section 404(g) of the Act (for those wetlands adjacent to traditionally navigable waters) as well as the &ldquo;significant nexus&rdquo; test (for those wetlands adjacent to other WOTUS, such as tributaries). Questions from multiple justices recognized that &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; does not always require physical touching, nor have the federal agencies ever applied so stringent a limitation in making jurisdictional determinations. Many justices focused on the core purpose of the Clean Water Act - to protect and maintain the water quality of our Nations&rsquo; waters - as perhaps requiring a more inclusive definition than that being proposed by the Sacketts. These lines of questions bode well for the significant nexus test and recognition that physical surface barriers may not cut off CWA jurisdiction for adjacent wetlands.</p>

<p>Where some justices did seem a bit concerned, however, was on the practical implications of applying a jurisdictional test that requires analysis (such as the significant nexus test) and potential impacts to landowners. Worried about whether a landowner might know whether they had a jurisdictional wetland on their property, one line of questioning revolved around the cost of determining jurisdiction that the landowner might have to bear. In response, counsel for the federal government responded that a landowner could ask EPA to make that jurisdictional determination and that they will do it at no cost to the landowner. Counsel went on to explain that, should the landowner wish to challenge that determination, only in the most extreme large-scale development projects &ndash; i.e., not mom-and-pop building their single-family home &ndash; do we see costs for supporting studies reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Another line of questioning tried to imply that since all waters are connected, it would be nearly impossible to know when an impact can be cut off. But again, the response was quick that, as the government has been applying the test since 2006, there must be a &ldquo;significant&rdquo; connection to establish jurisdiction. Yes, sometimes there may be disputes about that but it is not an unworkable standard that must be rejected by the court.</p>

<p>There were many great lines of questions both supporting and questioning the government&rsquo;s position in this case. Yet the reality of how agencies have applied the significant nexus test since 2006 has not borne these concerns out much. So, in light of the seeming support for the federal government&rsquo;s position in this case, I question what impact, if any, might these types of questions have.</p>

<p>There will be much analysis over the next few days on this case, and we won&rsquo;t really know what the justices are thinking until we see the final opinion. But I came away from today&rsquo;s oral arguments (knock on wood) more positive than I thought I would.</p>

<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-27468b99-7fff-eee6-3be8-94fdc32b4a4f""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">WOTUS has been a major issue under the Clean Water Act for my entire legal career (I started law school a few months after </span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Rapanos</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> was decided). Pennsylvania has fairly strong water quality protections with our Clean Streams Law. Still, there are places where a weakened CWA would impact our streams, lakes, and wetlands. I believe in the need &ndash; and the inherent right &ndash; for clean water, and I was encouraged today by the Court&rsquo;s acknowledgment and perhaps even support of the Clean Water Act&rsquo;s stated purpose. After 50 years of the Clean Water Act, I still remain hopeful that we will meet that goal. </span></span></p>

Growing Greener Lives On – with Bipartisan Support,8/29/2022,"<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Growing Greener program has a long history of bipartisan support. Now known as the State Parks and Outdoor Recreation Program, Growing Greener reflects the importance of clean streams, open space protections, and robust environmental infrastructure to members of both parties. We are proud to be among the state lawmakers who continue to support this crucial program.</p>

<p>The program&rsquo;s history goes back to 1999. Governor Tom Ridge signed into law legislation creating the first Growing Greener program to benefit various environmental initiatives including parks and recreation, clean water, agricultural improvements and sewer and water projects. This program received large bipartisan support.</p>

<p>Under Governor Ed Rendell, Growing Greener II became law in 2005. Funded with a bond issuance, Growing Greener II continued many of the same funding streams to benefit watersheds, outdoor recreation and the environment around our Commonwealth. It also received broad bipartisan support.</p>

<p>Since that time, there has been pent-up demand to enact a Growing Greener III program to provide new funding to these initiatives and to add to environmental investments in our state. The challenge has been finding funding while the Commonwealth has operated under strained budgets over the past decade.</p>

<p>However, with the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a significant stream of federal monies coming to states to address important issues during these challenging times. We introduced Growing Greener III bills in the Senate and the House this session that directed some of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) federal monies to be used to fund this latest update to this successful legacy program.</p>

<p>At the same time, other legislation was introduced in the Senate to provide millions of dollars of ARP funds for a Clean Streams Fund to address agricultural runoff and acid mine drainage. Once again, these bills had broad bipartisan support. The challenge was getting this legislation to the &ldquo;finish line&rdquo; when there were dozens of competing plans to use the limited amount of federal ARP monies.</p>

<p>Soon after introducing Senate Bill 525, we began working with the diverse Growing Greener coalition that had been formed years ago. Among the partners in this group are WeConservePA, Natural Lands, PennFuture, Lancaster Farmland Trust, Sierra Club, Trout Unlimited, and the Foundation for PA Watersheds.</p>

<p>Also, we worked with, and communicated on a regular basis with, DCNR Secretary Cindy Dunn who has been a vocal advocate for new investment.</p>

<p>In addition, we must acknowledge that the PA Farm Bureau listed these two bills as their top priority when they engaged with all legislators during their advocacy day in Harrisburg in late March.</p>

<p>With the assistance of all of these groups and Secretary Dunn, we were able to spread the word to their membership and from their membership to legislators and legislative leaders. As we headed into the serious budget negotiations in June, we could feel the momentum increasing.</p>

<p>The end result of July&rsquo;s comprehensive budget package &ndash; passed with broad bipartisan support &ndash; was a monumental investment in programs and initiatives to benefit the environment across our Commonwealth:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$100 million in ARP monies for parks and recreation along with $56 million additional from the oil and gas lease funds.</li>
	<li>$220 million for the Clean Streams Fund to address agricultural run-off and mine drainage, especially in how it affects the Chesapeake Bay.</li>
	<li>$320 million for sewer and water projects to ensure that our communities have access to safe and clean water and that our streams and rivers aren&rsquo;t infected with faulty or outdated systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to a concerted and united effort, this entire package was adopted.</p>

<p>We look forward to working with all of the coalition groups and supporters of this effort to ensure that these monies are well spent and that our Commonwealth and environment will benefit for generations to come.</p>

I, along with my wonderful colleague Michelle Giles from CVPA, were honored to be selected to be the co-coordinators helping guide along the process from inception to completion.</p>

<p>Our Shared Vision builds upon the great work of the <a href=""/Publication-PennFuture-Launches-Green-in-18-Campaign-to-Back-PA-Common-Conservation-Agenda-Developed-by-Statewide-Coalition-of-Environmental-Groups"">&ldquo;Green in &rsquo;18 Common Agenda&rdquo;</a>, a groundbreaking document that represented the first time that the Pennsylvania environmental community came together to list the top environmental issues facing the Commonwealth. This year, we wanted to build upon that great effort and expand it to be more even comprehensive.</p>

<p>First and foremost, while the 2018 Common Agenda had an environmental justice section, we purposely decided early on that environmental justice principles and policy solutions should be interwoven throughout the entire document. In order to hold the Steering Committee accountable to this lofty goal, we held meetings with environmental justice groups before, during, and after the drafting of the document to ensure that their concerns and desires were being heard and adequately addressed. We then added two environmental justice members to the Steering Committee, <a href=""https://www.maketheroadpa.org/"">Make the Road PA</a> and <a href=""https://onepa.org/vote/"">OnePA</a>, to ensure that our commitment remained steadfast. These meetings proved to be extremely valuable and helped shape our Shared Vision.</p>

<p>Their input directly leads to two more concrete changes from the 2018 Common Agenda: expansion on the number of sections and inclusion of personal profiles.</p>

<p>Our Shared Vision includes seven intertwining sections: Air, Water, Energy, Housing and Land Use, Labor, Democracy, and Education. We recognized that without protecting labor rights a transition to a green energy future is impossible. That without empowering and protecting our democratic institutions it will be impossible to protect our air &amp; water. And that it is only with quality environmental education for all students, that we can build an understanding and appreciation for how our natural world impacts us among future generations.</p>

<p>To ensure that these efforts are not mere abstracts, for each of these sections we selected a cross-selection of everyday citizens from throughout the four corners of Pennsylvania to talk about the immediate impact of the policies discussed. We believe that this adds a human touch to the Shared Vision, which reinforces the real-life benefits of our policies.</p>

<p>We recognize that drafting the document is only the first step, and we are now working diligently to see it implemented. We officially launched the Shared Vision this week with a press conference at the Harrisburg Capitol Rotunda. And for the rest of August throughout the state there are events posted that will be open to the public they are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Southwest Pennsylvania, Thursday, August 11 at 12pm: Hear from community members about how the energy industry has harmed local communities in PA, and policy solutions to reduce pollution and environmental racism before candidates tour the harmful impacts of the energy extraction industry.</li>
	<li>Northeastern Pennsylvania, Sunday, August 14 at 1pm, the Northeastern PA Pan African Coalition hosts their African Festival and graduation event for their Science, Conservation, Health, Engineering, Math, and Art children&rsquo;s program. <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nepa-pan-african-coalition-tickets-393116621397?ms=PF"">RSVP here!</a></li>
	<li>Southeastern Pennsylvania, Monday, August 15 at 6pm: Join the League of Women Voters for a webinar highlighting the intersection between democracy and the environment. <a href=""https://action.conservationpa.org/a/sepa-democracy-and-environment?ms=PF"">SIGN UP</a> </li>
	<li>Lehigh, Thursday, August 18 at 6pm, explore the devastating health consequences of lead in PA&rsquo;s aging homes, and policy solutions to protect children, families, and renters from poisoning, eviction, and displacement with Make the Road Pennsylvania, Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, and the Allentown Environmental Advisory Council at the Mountainville Youth Center in Allentown. <a href=""https://action.conservationpa.org/a/shared-vision-future-pennsylvanias-housing?ms=PF"">SIGN UP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And we don&rsquo;t intend to stop there. PennFuture and the other co-signers intend to build off our momentum this month, by using use the Shared Vision as a mechanism to educate the candidates seeking an elected position on the state level. After the elections, we intend to use this document as an education tool for incoming lawmakers and for the next gubernatorial administration. Finally, we intend to use this document over the next four years as an accountability tool, to see how much of the Shared Vision has been made reality.</p>

<p>We at PennFuture are proud of this document and encourage you to read it and share it with your friends, family, and community. Only if we work together, can we make our vision of a just, sustainable Pennsylvania into reality.</p>

Recent Passage of Lawn Care Bill Will Improve Pennsylvania's Waterways,7/21/2022,"<p>For over a decade clean water advocates have sought updates to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Fertilizer Act to include more protections for waterways. At last, this July we can celebrate the passage of such legislation. </p>

<p>We all have an important role to play when it comes to the health of our rivers and streams. Oftentimes, farmers feel much of the blame falls on them. However, routine lawn care practices can also impact our waterways. When applied in excess, lawn fertilizers can be a significant contributor to poor health of our waterways. </p>

<p>In the Susquehanna and Potomac river basins alone, roughly the center half of the state, Pennsylvanians apply roughly 22 million pounds of nitrogen <a href=""https://www.chesapeakebay.net/channel_files/37045/sweeney_uswg_turffertilizer_091719.pdf"">in the form of lawn fertilizer every year.</a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of nitrogen - the most important nutrient for maintaining luscious green turfgrass - flowing into Pennsylvania&rsquo;s streams and rivers. Excess nutrients feed not only grass. It fuels algae growth in our water bodies. When algae eventually dies, the decomposition process sucks oxygen out of the water, making it more difficult - sometimes impossible - for our streams, lakes and rivers to sustain life.</p>

<p>Excess nutrients are a major cause for one third of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s 86,000 miles of streams that are impaired. According to the Department of Environmental Protection, <a href=""/Blog-Item-Updated-Integrated-Water-Quality-Report-Reveals-33-percent-of-Pennsylvania-Waterways-are-Polluted"">more and more waterways are failing to meet water-quality standards.</a></p>

<p>Fertilizers enrich our lawns. But excessive nitrogen and phosphorus application impacts the clean water we need for better health, recreation, and wildlife diversity.</p>

<p>Excess nutrients can travel across state boundaries to neighboring states, affecting water bodies such as the Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, Ohio River, and Lake Erie.</p>

<p>In the case of the Chesapeake Bay, the Susquehanna River supplies 55 percent of the Bay&rsquo;s freshwater. Recent studies find it also <a href=""https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pennsylvania-water-science-center/science/pennsylvania-and-chesapeake-bay-watershed"">provides 44 percent of its nitrogen pollution</a>. While not the only culprit, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s nitrogen contributions are the highest of all states with water flowing into the Bay.</p>

<p>As a consequence, Pennsylvania is now under a so-called &ldquo;pollution diet,&rdquo; set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Commonwealth is required to reduce the rate of all nitrogen pollution sources <a href=""https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/dep_details.aspx?newsid=1520"">by 32.5 million pounds over the next three years.</a></p>

<p>For too long, improving water quality has been the responsibility of state, county and local governments, with a major burden falling on our agricultural communities. Yet we can only achieve true progress if all Pennsylvanians are engaged, including those of us with the luscious green lawns.</p>

<p>No one expects fertilizer use to stop entirely. Instead, it&rsquo;s time to modernize how fertilizer is regulated and applied in amounts that benefit lawns without causing impact to waterways.</p>

<p>Last updated in 2001, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Fertilizer Act requires state licenses for manufacturers, sets registration rules for fertilizer products, and establishes minimum labeling standards.</p>

<p>This July Act 83 of 2022 was signed into law establishing more environmentally beneficial turfgrass-management standards. Limits on nitrogen and phosphorous applications are already adopted by surrounding states.</p>

<p>Act 83 will also help to ensure that anyone - not just farmers - can get involved addressing nitrogen pollution.</p>

<p>Here are a few best practices you can incorporate into your lawn care routines:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Less is best. Minimize fertilizer applications and never use phosphorus unless for a new lawn or to remedy bare spots.</li>
	<li>Test the soil to know how much, if any, fertilizer is needed.</li>
	<li>Avoid applications during winter months or when the ground is frozen.</li>
	<li>Do not apply on impervious surfaces, especially near waterways or anytime when the forecast calls for heavy rain.</li>
	<li>Leave lawn clippings. The cut grass helps shade out weeds and conserve soil moisture.</li>
	<li>Plant native trees and shrubs. Many times native plants require less fertilizer.</li>
</ul>

<p>A well-maintained lawn, with a dense healthy cover of turf grass, can help to manage runoff pollution.</p>

<p>Act 83 will bring Pennsylvania&rsquo;s lawns closer to this ideal, while significantly improving water quality, aligning Pennsylvania&rsquo;s practices with neighboring states, and leveling the playing field by lessening the burden on Pennsylvania farmers.</p>

<p>Tackling excess fertilizer pollution through the measures enacted in Act 83 will go a long way in improving the health of local rivers and streams across the Commonwealth. </p>

Aquashicola Creek Finally Given Exceptional Value Designation,7/7/2022,"<p>After languishing at the Department for Environmental Protection (DEP) for nearly twelve years, the Aquashicola Creek was finally recognized as an Exceptional Value designation in January. This creek, whose upper reaches meander through relatively undeveloped and preserved tracts of land, will now receive the highest level of legal protection provided to waterways in Pennsylvania. For any activity for which the DEP must issue a permit or approval where the creeks water quality could be affected, the department must ensure, prior to issuing the permit or approval, that the water quality will not be degraded.</p>

<p>Its been a long road for the <a href=""http://www.apwc-pa.com/"">Aquashicola/Pohopoco Watershed Conservancy (APWC)</a>, which has led the charge over the years for the creeks redesignation. Previously, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission had designated sections of the creek as Class A Wild Trout Stream and Naturally Reproducing Trout Stream. However, APWC&rsquo;s stream redesignation petition provided stream monitoring data and supporting information demonstrating that Aquashicola Creek and its tributaries qualify for the Exceptional Value designation. Exceptional Value streams receive significant regulatory protection from harmful pollution because polluters are required without exception to demonstrate that their discharges into the waterway will not degrade water quality.</p>

<p>The redesignation process is lengthy and requires collecting petitions, gathering letters, and providing public comments. With the support of local residents, lawmakers, and conservation organizations, the APWC was able to get the existing use of the creek recognized by DEP as Exceptional Value, which ensures protection from its source at Ross Common Creek located in Ross Township to its confluence with the Buckwha Creek in Lower Towamensing Township located in Carbon County. While DEP is still in the process of upgrading the official designated use of the Aquashicola Creek basin, classifying the Exceptional Value existing use ensures the creek will receive the utmost protections. (Learn more about designated and existing uses through this short <a href=""https://youtu.be/DBWr4aFUvgM"">Our Pocono Waters video.)</a></p>

<p>This upper section of the Aquashicola is relatively undeveloped and includes several contiguous preserved tracts of land, like sections of the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge and PA State Game Lands 168. The creeks course flows parallel to the Appalachian Trail and Kittatinny Ridge, which is a world-famous Migratory Corridor of the Atlantic Flyway, and through wetlands that have special protection under Pennsylvania Code because they are home to threatened and/or endangered species of flora and fauna.</p>

<p>While the petition for the redesignation of the Aquashicola stalled at the DEP for over a decade, multiple development projects were proposed in the region that could have directly impacted this pristine creek. Threats posed by development in the Poconos are never-ending. Warehouses and resorts projects <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-True-Cost-of-Convenience-The-Impacts-of-Never-Ending-Warehouse-Development"">continue to appear in front of local planning commissions</a> and zoning boards, and Pennsylvanias healthiest waters are especially vulnerable to these forms of development.</p>

<p>Ultimately, an upgrade to Exceptional Value protects waterways designated as such, but it requires a great deal of dedication and determination to initiate the redesignation process and to follow it through to completion. The process seems simple on its face - submit a petition to DEP, DEP performs an assessment of the waterway, the stream is often added to a bundle of other streams for consideration, and is moved through the final steps of the regulatory process with the PA Environmental Quality Board (EQB). However, it takes a great deal of time and resources, especially when dealing with an underfunded and overburdened regulatory agency such as DEP who must choose which streams to prioritize across the Commonwealth. PennFutures <a href=""/Files/Admin/PF_StreamHandbook2019_web_2.10.20.pdf"">Stream Redesignation Handbook</a> breaks down the details of the process from start to finish, if youd like to learn more.</p>

<p>Special protection water quality designations - especially that of Exceptional Value - are incredibly important. Currently, more than thirty percent of Pennsylvanias creeks and streams are degraded and polluted. Only two percent are so clean and healthy that they are considered Exceptional Value. Eighty percent of those stream miles are found in the Poconos (primarily, Monroe, Wayne, and Pike Counties). Once these streams are degraded, its challenging - and sometimes impossible - to rehabilitate them. Thats why this redesignation process is vital to protecting water quality in the Commonwealth. Weve got to provide the greatest protections possible to these pristine waterways before we lose them.</p>

<p>We know that there are local and regional benefits to special designated creeks and streams. They add to the character and natural beauty of the region, support the local economy, and offer ecological services. For instance, we know that Exceptional Value streams in the Upper and Mid Delaware support $22 million in regional economic activities. We also know that protecting these creeks and streams provides wildlife habitat and mitigates local flooding. And when we expand our view across the Delaware River Basin, we see that the headwaters of the Delaware River provide drinking water for over 13 million people.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pennsylvania has a long history of waterways polluted by heavy industry, agriculture and stormwater runoff, and our dirty water problem is getting worse, not better. That&rsquo;s why it is absolutely critical to celebrate victories like the one we just saw with the Aquashicola Creek, and why it&rsquo;s vital for these Exceptional Value streams to receive the utmost protections from the state.</p>

Pennsylvania Began Participation in RGGI on July 1. What Happens Next?,7/6/2022,"<p><em>(This piece has been updated on July 11, 2022 to reflect recent action at the Commonwealth Court)</em></p>

<p>On July 8, 2022 the Commonwealth Court granted a petition by opponents of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s carbon budget and trade program (often known as the &ldquo;Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Rule&rdquo;) to temporarily halt the implementation and enforcement of the program while it addresses the specific issues that the opponents raised.</p>

<p>In addition to continuing to defend its rule before the Commonwealth Court, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has appealed the preliminary injunction to the State Supreme Court. As of this writing, we have no indication how long the appeal process will take. It&rsquo;s also unclear how this will impact the RGGI program but we explore a bit about RGGI and discuss a few possibilities here.</p>

<p><u>Background: PA&rsquo;s Participation in RGGI</u></p>

<p>To comply with the RGGI rules, polluting electric generators need to obtain one RGGI allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide they emit each year. Normally these will be purchased at quarterly auctions with the proceeds going to the RGGI state that created the allowance.</p>

<p>Companies aren&rsquo;t limited to buying allowances at auctions. There is also a secondary market as well where participants can buy and sell allowances amongst themselves at any time.</p>

<p>The RGGI program also gives companies added flexibility on when to purchase allowances. Compliance is measured over a series of three-year control periods. By the midnight March 1st compliance deadline following the end of each third year, a company must have turned in one allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide they emitted in each of the proceeding three years.</p>

<p>The first two years in each cycle are known as &ldquo;interim control periods.&rdquo; For those years, a company only needs to obtain allowances for 50 percent of their emissions for that year by the compliance deadline. For example, if a company emits 1,000 tons of CO2 per year, they need to turn in 500 allowances after the first year, another 500 allowances after the second year, and then the remaining 2,000 allowances by the end of the third year.</p>

<p>Because Pennsylvania wasn&rsquo;t participating in RGGI until after the start of 2022, companies only need to count their emissions between July 1 and December 31 toward their compliance obligation this year. Since 2022 is the second interim control period of RGGI&rsquo;s fifth three-year (2021 &ndash; 2023) control period, companies will need to obtain allowances for 50 percent of those emission by midnight of March 1, 2023.</p>

<p>Companies have two opportunities to do so. The non-profit organization, RGGI Inc., that manages the auctions is expected to hold allowance auctions on September 7th and December 7th. Between these two auctions, Pennsylvania is expected to make a little over 40 million allowances available for sale alongside the allowances from other participating states. (Because this is a regional program, companies can buy allowances from any participating state.)</p>

<p><u>Effects of Ongoing Legal Challenges</u></p>

<p>One issue unique to Pennsylvania is that there are two separate ongoing legal challenges. The first case was brought by Republican legislators who are opposed to RGGI but couldn&rsquo;t secure enough votes in the General Assembly to block the program. The second case was brought by some of the companies that are opposed to RGGI, alongside trade organizations like the PA Coal Alliance and other opponents. In both cases they asked the Commonwealth Court for a preliminary injunction&mdash;basically, an order from the court that tells the DEP to freeze the implementation of the rule in some way while the court decides the case on the merits.</p>

<p>To get a preliminary injunction, the requester must convince a court that some &ldquo;immediate and irreparable&rdquo; harm will occur to them unless it is granted and that the party requesting the injunction is likely to prevail on the merits when all is said and done. The industry claimed they will suffer this kind of harm&mdash;even though the compliance deadline isn&rsquo;t until next year. The Commonwealth Court sided with the industry on this point and discounted the harm to public health and welfare in terms of air quality, climate change, and other environmental impact.</p>

<p>While we disagree with this decision, we are now faced with assessing the damage that even a temporary injunction might cause. That is going to depend on a number of factors.</p>

<p><u>How long?</u></p>

<p>How long such an injunction would last is a difficult question and that will depend, at least in part, on how the case proceeds. It could only last a matter of days or weeks if the Supreme Court acts quickly and sides with the DEP on its appeal. If, on the other hand, an injunction remains in effect until the courts decide the lawsuits on the merits (including appeals), it could take from months to the better part of a year to ultimately resolve.</p>

<p><u>What about the current quarter, since Pennsylvania already became a participating state in RGGI?</u></p>

<p>If there is a very short injunction, it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily prevent Pennsylvania participating in the September auction and, almost certainly, wouldn&rsquo;t impact the December auction. If that happens, you might wonder how the injunction impacts the various companies&rsquo; compliance obligations. Does the pollution they emitted during the injunction still &ldquo;count&rdquo;, or are they allowed to pollute for free? Here, the answer is going to depend on the gritty details of what the court decides. Companies need to track their CO2 emissions anyway, so continuing to do so is hardly a burden and there is plenty of time to resolve any questions before the compliance deadline, but every day that pollution doesn&rsquo;t count towards the allowance requirement puts more money in the pockets of polluters.</p>

<p>Assuming the pollution emitted during an injunction still counts, it would still be better to resolve the case in time for PA to participate in the September auction. The cloud of indecisions could easily impact the behavior of potential buyers and, ultimately, depress the &ldquo;clearing price&rdquo; of the auction, meaning the end of day dollar amount that the RGGI allowances are worth. If the allowances sell for less, that directly translates into smaller proceeds that Pennsylvania can invest in reducing air pollution, we as Pennsylvanians who want clean air have a strong interest in avoiding that scenario.</p>

<p>Holding the December auction is likely more critical. If we lose the opportunity to sell allowances in 2022 we could, possibly, roll them forward into 2023 auctions, but the next one won&rsquo;t be until after the March 1st compliance deadline. It&rsquo;s hard to say how that situation would be resolved, but polluters will almost assuredly try and avoid their compliance obligation entirely.</p>

<p><u>Whats Next?</u></p>

<p>As we said in the beginning, there is no way yet to know what the exact outcome will be until we see the judge&rsquo;s order and reasoning, which we expect soon. Whichever way the court holds, it&rsquo;s clear that there could be huge impacts to the Clean Air Fund. PennFuture will be watching and stands ready to update you on whatever will come next.</p>

We Must Continue to Work for Change,7/5/2022,"<p>Standing on the doorstep to my retirement, <a href=""/News-PennFuture-President-and-CEO-Jacquelyn-Bonomo-Announces-Retirement"">announced in February</a>, the last few months have included a lot of reminiscing, reflecting and taking stock.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been wonderful to hear from so many dear friends and former colleagues whom I&rsquo;ve worked with across the country. You&rsquo;ve been so generous with well-wishes and advice about retirement. Those working in our movement &mdash; the protection of our planet, its environment, and all that inhabit it &mdash; are in pursuit of a &ldquo;greater good&rdquo; and come to our work and mission through a profession, an avocation, a passion, a personal imperative.</p>

<p>Mission binds us, and for me, has been a nearly unmatched priority in my life.The opportunity to have done this work has been beyond satisfying, both a privilege and a challenge, and has given me an eco-family, in addition to my birth family.</p>

<p>There have been a small handful of people who have hired me along the way, mentored me, supervised me, just given me a chance, so thank you very, very much. And thank you to the folks that have worked &ldquo;for&rdquo; me and always so brilliantly.</p>

<p>As I step away, in this moment, we all have grave concerns.Our democracy, our climate, our freedoms, and future generations are grievously threatened.The environmental movement is realizing intersectionality with other movements.In my opinion, the commonalities that are bringing us together are somewhat tenuous.So what binds us needs to be elevated beyond the matters (racism, ageism, classism, political affiliations, city folk or country folk to name a few) that can pull us back into our separate corners. We need to seek out any and all like-minded entities with whom to work, to build power that can outlast the storms that have always been on the horizon, but that are here now and that cannot be under-estimated.</p>

<p>Here at PennFuture, we&rsquo;ve taken important steps to bridge divides.We created new programs around civic participation and democracy, in part to open our organization to issues of concern to communities of color.We&rsquo;ve really ramped up our presence in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s mid-sized towns and communities &ndash; such as Erie, the Lehigh Valley, and the Pocono northeast. And we are working hard to raise funds to have more of a presence in the north-central heartland counties.These places are strategic to power building, to fight statewide threats that emanate from the underserved and forgotten communities in these locales, and to put us into closer contact with people who can help us figure out how PennFuture can be successful with our work in such a divided state.</p>

<p>The organization I leave is healthy, and stable, and in the stewardship of very competent and committed individuals.2022 will be an important one for our state, particularly as we approach the fall general elections.After that, we&rsquo;ll know where things stand and this knowledge will enable PennFuture, and our strategic partner Conservation Voters of PA, to build their next strategic plan to address those realities, and threats.</p>

<p>I take great pride in the work PennFuture has done since I came here in 2015.Our thought leadership has been elevated. Our work on greener economic development has made its way into state and federal policy. We are positioned to offer expertise on emerging threats to our climate &ndash; the fossil fuel dimensions of bitcoin mining, new hydrogen hubs, refineries, plastics and petrochemical facilities.</p>

<p>A space I have always been personally comfortable in has been in advocacy, and like me, PennFuture has been plain in using our voice and influence to fight against industry&rsquo;s influence on our legislature and our communities.It&rsquo;s not just in sports where &ldquo;defense&rdquo; is the headline.So it has been with PennFuture&rsquo;s essential work to fight the onslaught of bad policies, bad proposals, and bad projects &mdash; the vast majority to favor fracked gas and other fossil fuels &mdash; that just keep coming.Our legal team has elevated its game in response to these threats, and in addition to just fighting hard, is always looking to test ideas and strategies that protect forgotten communities and places against environmental harms.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve won in the courts.We are moving Pennsylvania forward in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), PennFuture&rsquo;s climate priority since October 2019.And this summer, in the midst of the budget, we are seeing good possibilities for much-needed environmental funding <a href=""https://www.penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/state-officials-advocates-ask-legislature-to-fund-waterway-protection-five-for-the-weekend/"">to be realized because of bi-partisan work inthe legislature.</a>If this does happen, it will be a cause for celebration, not just for the green economy sectors (agriculture, outdoor recreation and tourism), and land and waters that will benefit, but for the outcome of having all political parties&rsquo; support for our environment.</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve reflected on in these past months, has been the coalition of groups that helped many years ago to &ldquo;stop&rdquo; the damming of Nescopeck Creek, sort of my conservation origin story. Involved were people of all political persuasions; there were scientists, hunters, and anglers and Sierra Clubbers, and many more involved. Pennsylvania has a rich natural heritage that for decades was embraced by all. We must return to that place.</p>

<p>That day in 1984 when I made a promise to myself to fight the damming of that free-flowing stream, I did what it took to put that promise into action, and organized, and fought, and won. We must be willing to carry on the fight when necessary, to build bridges where we can and until we change hearts and minds, and our state.</p>

<p>Lastly, for the many, many years that I had the privilege to be in this field, I came to work every day and tried to make something happen, tried to create change. Between the fights, some losses, and wins, I never lost hope that change is possible. This work is a long-term proposition. I feel blessed to help carry the green flame for four decades; and pass it onto others who I know will pursue it with fight, endurance, and hope.</p>

Philly Tree Fund Bill A Significant Step in Protection of Tree Canopy,6/29/2022,"<p>Philadelphia passed Councilmember Katherine Gilmore Richardson’s Philly Tree Fund bill during a marathon session last week. The bill helps Philadelphia take a significant step in the protection of its tree canopy and more equally distribute its benefits. </p>

<p>This legislation was an effort to implement ideas from the recent draft of the <a href=""https://sites.google.com/hinge-collective.com/philly-tree-plan"">Philly Tree Plan</a>, Philadelphia’s first long-term urban forest planning initiative, which is expected to be finalized in the coming months. </p>

<p>Philadelphia’s black and brown communities continue to experience disproportionate effects of environmental and health hazards, hazards that threaten to worsen as climate change advances. Among these are dealing with extreme urban heat. The city’s Office of Sustainability, for instance, has found more than a 22-degree temperature difference between some underserved communities and wealthier neighboring communities in 2015. Trees have a significant role in these temperature differences. </p>

<p>Among the more understated values of trees is their shading, which reduces the amount of sunlight hitting pavements and buildings, cooling the surrounding area. Trees also do the same through transpiration, cooling the air as liquid water from the trees’ leaves evaporates into gas. It is significant then, that according to the Tree Plan, Philadelphia lost 6% in tree cover between 2008 and 2018. Also of the over <a href=""https://treephilly.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tree-Canopy-Assessment-Report-Philadelphia-2018.pdf"">a thousand acres of tree canopy</a> that were removed, most were from residential areas exacerbating environmental and health disparities between communities.</p>

<p>Making matters more challenging are the issues that exist in zoning regulations and the zoning process. Regulations designed to protect tree cover require developers to replace certain trees. However, existing policies <a href=""https://gridphilly.com/blog-home/2022/4/29/tree-laws-in-philadelphia-have-loopholes-big-enough-to-drive-a-logging-truck-through/"">exempt trees</a> growing in parks or on single or two-family lots, despite both contributing to much of Philadelphia’s existing tree canopy. </p>

<p>The Department of Licenses and Inspections is also in need of more support. In addition to a host of responsibilities that include ensuring the safety of demolition and construction activities, inspectors are also tasked with interpreting and enforcing tree regulations despite most <a href=""https://gridphilly.com/blog-home/2022/5/11/councilmember-katherine-gilmore-richardson-moves-to-close-tree-protection-loopholes/"">not having expertise in the area</a>. This, as one might suspect, makes enforcement of tree violations that much more inconsistent contributing, at least in part, to declining tree cover. </p>

<p>Councilmember Gilmore Richardson’s legislation seeks to reverse this decline all the while advancing environmental justice efforts and tightening up regulations. </p>

<p>On the whole, the bill focuses on increasing tree preservation and planting requirements and does so through different means. For one, it removes the exemption from parks and open spaces, requiring developers to replace trees that were cut down in future related projects. It also does the same for single or two-family lots that are greater than 5000 square feet. The same also applies to planting in drive-thrus and parking lots <a href=""https://www.phillyvoice.com/tree-canopy-decline-city-council-plantings-philadelphia-philly-tree-fund/"">with provisions in place</a> for areas that cannot add trees. This tightening of exemptions will further contribute to tree planting efforts. </p>

<p>There is also a tree fund created that is sourced from fees on developers who do not replace trees that were cut down. The funds will be used to plant trees elsewhere.</p>

<p>The bill also increases planting in residential areas and grants credits for preserving existing trees towards trees required by the Zoning Code. One of the forms this takes is in the requirement for some development projects to plant yard trees. It also calls for tree plantings in lots near select boulevards, expressways, and roads. </p>

<p>Again, the creation of this fund and increasing planting requirements and preservation incentives are impactful in helping get Philadelphia back on track towards its goal of achieving <a href=""https://treephilly.org/about/"">a 30% tree canopy by 2030.</a> </p>

<p>Stormwater runoff remains an issue in Philadelphia. During rain events, water runs off and flows into sewer systems, which can overwhelm rivers and pollute with things like fertilizer, oil, and other sediments. In certain instances, runoff is also capable of flooding homes and businesses. Managing it is essential and green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is a sustainable means. Buffers are an example of GSI and are a prominent focus of the proposed legislation.</p>

<p>The bill requires vegetative buffers near highways and industrial sites among others. These buffers would provide areas where stormwater can penetrate the soil and replenish groundwater reserves, slowing the runoff rate and protecting the neighboring areas' water quality. It also clarifies the requirements for tree buffers. More efficient tree buffer systems better provide shade and enhance the cooling effects of transpiration, helping decrease temperatures for areas. Additional protections are also put in place for heritage trees.</p>

<p>The bill covers several of the recommendations from the Philly Tree Plan. The most notable of these was the creation of a tree fund sourced from fees for the non-compliance of developers in planting a certain amount of trees, much like the one found in Councilmember Gilmore Richardson’s bill. It also addressed calls for greater involvement of local communities in the form of a notification process for tree clearings. </p>

<p>The bill did however see amendments added to it in order to secure its passing. Other than areas where the technical language was made more specific, this included exempting land under the Philadelphia Authority For Industrial Development from certain rules, in particular those regarding the preservation of heritage trees.</p>

<p>An amendment exempting affordable housing projects from the requirements of the bill raised concerns for multiple testifiers during a previous hearing before City Council’s Rules Committee. PennFuture shares these concerns as low-income residents often suffer from the most severe lack of tree canopy and the related benefits. It was also disappointing to see that the 5th Councilmanic District was also exempted from the requirements of the bill as efforts to build our canopy will require a citywide effort and should, ultimately, be governed by uniform standards. </p>

<p>Despite its significant advances toward realizing the ever-important vision of the Tree Plan and restoring Philadelphia’s tree canopy, there is still much work to be done in that regard. </p>

<p>One of the areas that future legislation can pursue is the creation of a new office within the city’s existing Parks and Recreation Department. The Tree Plan refers to such an office as the Office of the City Forester and its function would be to oversee tree-related regulations. This can be one of the most beneficial steps in advancing Philadelphia’s tree efforts, helping improve the coordination of all tree-related activities, programs, and planning. </p>

<p>Further, also in line with the Tree Plan’s aims to invest in the people and communities as part of the tree effort, existing programs that communities trust to support tree planting and tree care should receive greater funding. One of these organizations is PowerCorpsPHL, a workforce development program that focuses on environmental service. PowerCorpsPHL is responsible <a href=""https://powercorpsphl.org/"">for planting 8800 trees</a> in Philadelphia since its recent conception. Greater funding would help programs such as this do more for trees, while also helping citizens acquire careers in the process. </p>

<p>More significant financial incentives for private landowners are also a viable option to pursue. More free tree seedlings could be provided to homeowners in addition to greater public education efforts around urban trees. This could also take the form of more substantial grants, tax rebates, and consulting services.<a href=""https://medium.com/climate-conscious/how-cities-can-protect-trees-on-private-land-7a4184644f29""> In Hawaii</a>, owners of certain valued trees for instance can claim a tax deduction of $3,000 every three years for maintenance costs. </p>

<p>The bill is a vital first step in realizing the significant environmental and socio-economic benefits trees can have on Philadelphia and can be the foundation from which these benefits manifest for all. <br />

PennFuture Protects Major River Basins Across Pennsylvania in Stormwater Settlement,6/27/2022,"<p>On Tuesday, June 21, 2022, PennFuture successfully reached an agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), PennDOT, and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) in its lawsuit seeking stronger protections from stormwater runoff.</p>

<p>A bit of background: When there are storms, the ground can become saturated, andexcess water flows across the surface and into rivers, lakes, and streams. As it moves along, it picks up whatever dirt, trash, oil, dust, and anything else that is sitting on the ground surface. The water that runs off hard, impervious surfaces, such as roads, can become especially polluted, because of the oil and exhaust solids that cars and trucks give off. The big three pollutants from this &ldquo;stormwater runoff&rdquo; are <a href=""https://extension.psu.edu/what-is-sediment-and-why-is-it-a-stormwater-pollutant"">sediment</a> (mainly fine dirt and dust), <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/issue"">nitrogen, and phosphorus</a>. All runoff water eventually flows into our streams, rivers, and lakes, and collects, building up and leading to toxic algae blooms, cloudy, cloudy water that can&rsquo;t support aquatic life, and water we can&rsquo;t use for fishing or any other enjoyment.</p>

<p>However, under the federal Clean Water Act, municipalities and public (or quasi-public) entities, such as PennDOT and the PTC, are required to take action to control their stormwater runoff. Exactly what action they have to take is controlled by their stormwater permits, which are issued every 5 years by DEP. There are two kinds: first, there is a so-called &ldquo;general&rdquo; permit, which has more generally applicable terms and has a straightforward application process; second, a town or entity has the option to apply for an &ldquo;individual&rdquo; permit, which has terms that are more tailored to their own individual needs and business conditions.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2021, DEP issued an individual permit each to PennDOT and PTC, and PennFuture noticed those permits were seriously flawed for two big reasons. First, we believed the permits allowed PennDOT and PTC to have much more lenient standards than other municipalities or comparable entities. Second, on top of that, the permits let both PennDOT and PTC &ldquo;trade&rdquo; their pollution reduction across different major watersheds &ndash; Ohio River, Lake Erie, and Delaware River. This meant that not only were they being held to lower standards in the first place, but it was possible to lower the standards even further, and favor one watershed over another so that some watersheds might not have as much water quality protection as other watersheds in the Commonwealth. Now is not the time to walk back water protections for anyone, and PennFuture was willing to wade into these turbulent legal waters to be hold DEP accountable.</p>

<p>PennFuture believes that all watersheds in Pennsylvania should be protected, and that all entities should be tasked with protecting our waters equally. It simply defies logic to allow someone to treat several different watersheds as one single one: if that were true, then they wouldn&rsquo;t be separate watersheds! Each river, and the people who use it, deserve the same protection.</p>

<p>Through our litigation against DEP, PennDOT, and PTC, PennFuture is pleased with the final settlement that has been reached: PennDOT and PTC will not be able to do any interbasin trading for their pollution reduction; each watershed at issue must reach the same level of stormwater pollution reduction. While the overall pollution reduction amounts remain the same, PennFuture believes that our lawsuit has sent a strong signal that there are watchdogs looking out for clean water and the highest standards. We will continue to watchdog when the specifics of the pollution reduction plans are released later this year to ensure that these plans are protective of water quality.</p>

<p>Bottom line: As a result of PennFuture&rsquo;s close watchdogging and resulting litigation, PennDOT and PTC will now be required to protect each of the watersheds they are in equally, and we expect that there will be significant reductions in stormwater pollution as a result.</p>

Turning PA into a “Hydrogen Hub” is not a Sustainable Energy Solution,6/24/2022,"<p>Discussions around beginning a massive-scale Blue Hydrogen project in Pennsylvania began hitting the media around August of 2021, where fossil fuel industry leader Perry Babb announced the launch of <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2021/08/15/A-laboratory-at-scale-a-hydrogen-carbon-storage-shale-drilling-and-urea-project-has-hit-the-industry-zeitgeist-at-just-the-right-time/stories/202108080048%E2%80%8B"">a $410 million project called KeyState to Zero in Clinton County</a>, north-central Pennsylvania. This effort was part of a larger push by a mixture of government and private entities to pursue hydrogen as an alleged means to achieve net zero carbon emissions. I also wrote a blog on <a href=""/Blog-Item-Pennsylvania-as-a-Hydrogen-Hub"">Pennsylvania becoming a &ldquo;Hydrogen Hub&rdquo;</a>in September of 2021. In October of 2021, PennFuture&rsquo;s Rob Altenburg joined the Ohio River Valley Institute for a webinar on the emergence of hydrogen (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmNZveWOSCM&amp;t=812s"">archived here</a>), and subsequently published a blog <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Basics-of-Hydrogen"">discussing the basics of Hydrogen.</a></p>

<p>Since then, attention around hydrogen has only grown, especially in the eyes of federal and state government leadership. In May of this year, Governor Wolf <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2022/05/16/pennsylvania-gov-tom-wolf-hydrogen-carbon-sequestration-storage-hub-climate-energy-southwestern-natural-gas-shell-cracker-petrochemical-plant-beaver/stories/202205160087"">announced his full endorsement</a> of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (&ldquo;CCS&rdquo;). CCS is a process <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/2287551-inside-the-race-to-scale-up-co2-capture-technology-and-hit-net-zero/"">that captures some carbon dioxide emissions</a> from sources (like coal-fired power plants) and either reuses or stores it so it will not enter the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Governor and state agencies such as the Department of Community and Economic Development, announced their intention to take advantage of an $8 billion federally-funded project (which is part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed last year) spearheaded by the United States Department of Energy that calls for at least four hydrogen hubs across the country. Fossil fuel companies such as Shell, Equinor, EQT, and about a dozen others have joined in and have been making the pitch for a public-private partnership to advance this project. PennFuture <a href=""/News-PennFuture-Responds-to-Gov-Wolfs-Hydrogen-Hub-Announcement-on-May-16"">swiftly spoke out</a> against the Governor and others&rsquo; move to support this project without fully evaluating the environmental and human dangers it presents.</p>

<p>As I wrote about last year, <a href=""/Blog-Item-Its-Past-Time-for-Pennsylvania-to-Invest-in-Renewable-Energy"">Pennsylvania must develop and support truly renewable energy projects:</a></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Instead of doubling down on an unsustainable and dirty fracked gas industry, Pennsylvania must work to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote alternatives such as energy efficiency and clean renewable energy. To do so, we must align our investments with our goals and avoid unintended side effects that promote pollution and poison our communities and our workers.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>We recognized then that this &ldquo;hydrogen hub&rdquo; pitch is merely another fracked gas industry scheme to keep itself alive for a bit longer while falsely presenting this project as a wholesale &ldquo;clean energy solution.Hydrogen development is not the sustainable energy solution it is currently being billed as for Pennsylvania and its future.</p>

<p><u>PennFuture&rsquo;s New Report on Hydrogen</u></p>

<p>PennFuture has recently published a paper entitled <a href=""/Files/Admin/PennFuture-Hydrogen-Position-Paper-Final-%28June-2022%29.pdf"">&ldquo;Hydrogen in Pennsylvania: An Opportunity to Do It Right.&rdquo;</a> In this paper, we went into detail about the risks of blue and gray hydrogen as well as CCS. We recognize that Pennsylvania needs a state net-zero plan that truly sets the Commonwealth on a path to transitioning from fossil fuel power to clean energy, prioritizing and supporting more energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, as well as targeted, niche technologies like CCS and green hydrogen. We need a real climate protection policy that limits carbon and methane pollution and drives investments in clean energy and efficiency as quickly as possible. Hydrogen and CCS may be useful tools in limited situations, but they are not the climate solution on their own.</p>

<p><u>What is Hydrogen?</u></p>

<p>Hydrogen is being proposed as a &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; alternative to methane (e.g., fracked gas). However, hydrogen exists in various forms.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a renewable, zero-carbon energy source is used, such as hydrolysis, the result is clean <span style=""color:#008000;"">&ldquo;green&rdquo;</span> hydrogen.</li>
	<li>Hydrogen derived from fracked gas and other fossil fuels is known as <span style=""color:#808080;"">&ldquo;gray&rdquo;</span> hydrogen and accounts for 95 percent of U.S. production. This steam reformation process requires combustion of fracked gas which produces carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, both climate-impacting gasses. This is what is being proposed by the &ldquo;hydrogen hub&rdquo; proponents.</li>
	<li><span style=""color:#0000FF;"">&ldquo;Blue&rdquo;</span> hydrogen is cultivated through the use of CCS technology. However, CCS <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blue-Hydrogen-Presentation_February-2022.pdf"">has not proven itself economically feasible</a> in large-scale installations and limitations of capture efficiency along with other fugitive emissions means methane gas will still be released.</li>
</ul>

<p>So rather than rely on complicated color codes, we focus on the end results: hydrogen is either produced with zero carbon, or it is polluting.</p>

<p><u>PennFuture&rsquo;s Positions</u></p>

<p>PennFuture recognizes that clean hydrogen may be a useful technology toward meeting the climate goals of net-zero by 2050, but it can only be supported, subject to the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Renewable energy now. Pursuing the myth that fracked gas could be a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; to a clean energy economy has already wasted more time than we could afford to waste. Development and investment in renewable energy must be a number one priority.</li>
	<li>Limited uses. We must think of hydrogen not as a fuel, but as one of many potential energy storage mechanisms. If industries can use true clean renewable energy directly, they should.</li>
	<li>Stringent public health and environmental safety practices and regulations. We must ensure strong protections for our workers, local communities, and environment and must not allow new development to increase burdens&mdash;particularly on environmental justice communities.</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on these positions, PennFuture cannot support the proposed dirty hydrogen facilities (including the regional hydrogen hubs), sought after by the fracking and petrochemical industry and Governor Tom Wolf. We must prioritize our limited resources on renewable energy technology development and support clean, renewable energy projects in Pennsylvania now.</p>

<p><u>Policy Recommendations</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pennsylvania needs to develop a cohesive, statewide net-zero energy policy that provides a true pathway to modernizing the state energy system.</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania must stop advancing subsidies for fracked gas, petrochemicals, and other fracked gas-dependent technologies; and Pennsylvania should begin ratcheting down its centuries-long taxpayer support for fossil fuels.</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania must facilitate and support the development of truly renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and in some cases, green hydrogen.</li>
	<li>Pennsylvania must ensure that environmental justice is at the forefront of any projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pennsylvania is at a crossroads between the dirty energy past and a green energy future, and yet our leaders continue to look backwards. Embracing false solutions like &ldquo;Hydrogen Hubs&rdquo; will cost Pennsylvanians their health, lives, and millions of dollars in lost job opportunities by not investing state resources towards building out a robust renewable energy infrastructure while the industry is beginning to expand worldwide.</p>

"New Plastic Bag Ban Bill in Philadelphia Could Result in Cleaner, Greener Future",6/21/2022,"<p>Philadelphia&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to address the plastic waste crisis are poised to make significant advances following City Council&rsquo;s summer recess. This advance is in the form of the potential passing of a new bill under Councilmember Mark Squilla that aims to further address plastic bag use and limit its subsequent harmful impacts.</p>

<p>Prior to Philadelphia&rsquo;s original ban on single-use plastic bags, estimates showed that the city used well over one billion plastic bags a year, which littered our streets and clogged our waterways. For water, in particular, the environmental and human impacts are rather significant. Plastic degrades into microplastics in water, something that <a href=""https://pennenvironment.org/reports/pac/microplastics-pennsylvania"">recent reports from PennEnvironment confirm</a> is in 100% of the state water samples they collected. These microplastics are not just ingested by the environment and its wildlife but also by people, in addition to the toxic chemicals often found with these plastics such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, combining to have serious <a href=""https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Plastic-and-Health-The-Hidden-Costs-of-a-Plastic-Planet-February-2019.pdf"">long-term human health impacts.</a></p>

<p>Plastic bags also clog Philadelphia&rsquo;s recycling facilities, with officials <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/phillys-plastic-bag-ban-is-finally-here-with-enforcement-still-to-come/"">estimating 10,000 hours</a> being spent just untangling bags from equipment.</p>

<p>For these reasons, efforts to reduce plastic bag usage have been in motion for several years. It began first in 2007 whenCouncil tried to ban plastic bag usage outright. Then-councilmembers Jim Kenney and Frank DiCicco led the charge <a href=""https://billypenn.com/2019/02/25/after-a-decade-of-strikeouts-philly-might-actually-ban-plastic-bags/"">with the support of four others</a>. However, lobbying efforts from grocers and petrochemical actors were too potent for the bill to hold ground.</p>

<p>The same contingent attempted <a href=""https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philadelphia-plastic-bag-ban-trashed/1884469/"">to do the same in 2009</a>, but again to no avail and for similar reasons.</p>

<p>In 2012, media organization Green Philly attempted to revive these conversations, leading a petition to ban disposable bags <a href=""https://billypenn.com/2019/02/25/after-a-decade-of-strikeouts-philly-might-actually-ban-plastic-bags/"">which received over 1,300 signatures</a>, and started <a href=""https://billypenn.com/2019/02/25/after-a-decade-of-strikeouts-philly-might-actually-ban-plastic-bags/"">a Facebook page</a> to document the littering of plastic bags across Philadelphia. Though an admirable effort that highlighted the popular sentiment in favor of reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, it was not enough for Council to take action.</p>

<p>It would not be until 2015 that momentum for this cause would increase in earnest. Councilmember Squilla took up this environmental initiative and proposed that <a href=""https://billypenn.com/2019/02/25/after-a-decade-of-strikeouts-philly-might-actually-ban-plastic-bags/"">a five-cent fee be attached</a> to the bags. It would charge the fee to those using a single-use bag from retail establishments and it would be imposed on both plastic and paper bags. Despite having support from a broad-based coalition of environmental and community groups, the bill again fell through.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/state/wolf-plastic-bags-environment-jobs-veto-20170701.html"">In 2017</a>, the Pennsylvania General Assembly attempted to subvert local authority and secure the interests of the petrochemical industries through preemption. A bill managed to pass that would have not allowed municipalities from issuing a plastic bag ban in the first place, something that would go on to be vetoed by Governor Tom Wolf. <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Plastics-Problem-More-False-Strategies-Statewide-Preemption"">Again in 2019</a>, the General Assembly maneuvered to sneak a ban into that year&rsquo;s state budget proposal.</p>

<p>Philadelphia sued the State in response and the budget laws banning local governments from implementing plastic-bag bans have since expired.</p>

<p>It would not be until 2019 that a ban on single-use bags would be implemented in Philadelphia. While environmental advocates were enthused about the directionCouncil was headed with such a bill, there was a recognition that the ban did not go far enough. The biggest concernwas the lack of a fee structure. The original bill had a provision for a ban on all single-use plastic bags and a 15-cent fee for others but a compromise was made to remove the fee.</p>

<p>Hybrid structures for bag bans, those with bans and fee components, are found to be the most effective approach in this regard, something that the new bill calls for. It concentrates costs to consumers of plastic bags. Fees for plastic bags labeled as free are in fact not. Instead, the price is passed off overhead of the retailer that is passed onto customers in the price of goods purchased. The 15-cent fee component of this new bill would make sure that this cost is attributed to just those who consume these bags, while fees on recyclable paper and reusable bags would encourage customers to bring their own bags.</p>

<p>This approach would also discourage shoppers from just switching from plastic to paper and encourage the use of reusable carryout bags instead. Studies have supported this. One looked at the response to Washington DC&rsquo;s law applying a five-cent bag fee. It found that after the implementation of the five-cent bag fee, plastic bag use declined <a href=""https://doee.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ddoe/publication/attachments/DDOE%202013%20Bag%20Law%20Survey%20Final%20Report%20(2).pdf"">by over 60 percent.</a> Much of the same success could be experienced in Philadelphia if the new bill is passed.</p>

<p>The current structure of ban and no fee also runs the risk of increasing plastic and other resource consumption. With no fee disincentive, customers often take whatever alternatives are still available for free. As a result, as consumption of thin single-use plastic bags decreases, consumption of the remaining free paper and thicker plastic bags often increase. Under the 2019 bill, &ldquo;reusable&rdquo; bags thicker than 2.25 mils and paper bags become the &ldquo;free&rdquo; alternatives. Studies have proven this. One that examined the <a href=""https://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Bag_Tax_Paper_final.pdf"">carryout bag use in Chicago supermarkets</a> before and after the implementation of a fee showed substantial decreases in single-use bag usage and increases in customers bringing their own bags or no bags.</p>

<p>These options, however, are more expensive for the grocer. As a result, this increase in cost is incorporated into retailer&rsquo;s overhead and has more consequential environmental impacts. Thicker plastic bags are heavier to transport, consume higher amounts of fossil fuels and require higher levels of ethylene to produce into plastics. These all serve to increase Philadelphia&rsquo;s overall climate emissions.</p>

<p>Paper bags, on the other hand, have their own set of harmful environmental impacts. The paper-making process uses a lot of energy and can be a major source of water pollution. Transportation emissions are also a concern here. The new bill would help curb these consumer and environmental harms.</p>

<p>Concerns over the additive cost to lower-income residents can also be addressed with this new rendition of the bill. This could be in the form of greater outreach and reusable giveaway efforts towards these lower-income communities and exemptions from fees for those residents that are SNAP/WIP participants.</p>

<p>The time for action is now. While the plastic bag ban bill in 2019 put Philadelphia on the right course to address plastic pollution, it does not do enough. The new plastic ban bill can right the ship and steer Philadelphia into a more equitable, cleaner, and greener future.</p>

"PennFuture, Partners Advocate for Clean Water Funding Opportunities in the State Budget",6/15/2022,"<p>It&rsquo;s budget season in Harrisburg!</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has $2.2 billion in federal American Rescue Plan funding that remains unallocated out of $7 billion it originally received. Recognizing the importance of natural infrastructure and healthy rivers and streams to public health, this money should be used to fund clean water programs and practices.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are two proposals being debated in Harrisburg that would direct $750 million to conservation, clean water, and open space protection.</p>

<p>The first bill, called SB 525 in the Senate and HB 2020 in the House, would reinvigorate a popular conservation program created under former Gov. Tom Ridge two decades ago.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Growing Greener program provides critical support to community-driven work that improves and protects our cities and towns. Since 1999, Growing Greener has been a lifeline to conservation and clean water projects across the state. These investments bring lasting benefits to communities across Pennsylvania from clean water to open spaces to recreational pursuits for Pennsylvanians and tourists alike.</p>

<p>The second bill, called SB 832 in the Senate and HB 1901 in the House, would create a new Clean Streams Fund to tackle water pollution from nonpoint sources such as agriculture runoff and drainage from abandoned mines. Specifically, this new Fund would establish new programs and give a boost to existing programs. It would create the Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program to help farmers and the Municipal Stormwater Assistance Program to provide funding to local governments to manage stormwater.</p>

<p>On June 8th, PennFuture led a bipartisan effort in the Capitol Rotunda to call on lawmakers to support clean water funding in this year&rsquo;s budget, which must be passed by June 30.</p>

<p>Specifically, PennFuture and 25 partner co-sponsors - along with Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn, Sen. Carolyn Comitta, Rep. Lynda Culver, and the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau - held a press conference in Harrisburg in support of the Growing Greener III program and the Clean Streams Fund.</p>

Subsurface Storage is a Promising Addition to our Renewable Energy Arsenal,6/14/2022,"<p>Batteries, storage, renewables: you&rsquo;ve probably heard these terms a lot alongside each other when the topic of clean energy comes up. One of the true barriers facing Pennsylvania&rsquo;s transition to a clean energy future is the need for a balanced grid and for on-demand power. We know this to be true, which is why we&rsquo;re excited to talk about some of the new technology that is being developed with help from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s own brain trust that can help advance a cleaner future and environment in Pennsylvania and across the nation.</p>

<p>Over the past several weeks, PennFuture has been researching and interviewing entities and individuals working on bringing a new technology that uses the principles of<a href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower"">Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH)</a> to communities across the United States. The idea behind PSH as it relates to renewable energy is simple: when demand is high, the grid simply draws energy directly from renewable sources. As demand drops, that clean energy is still being generated, but the excess is then used to pump water between two reservoirs at different elevations. When demand goes back up, the water is released, and its energy is captured and used by consumers on the grid. PSH is often considered the gold standard for energy storage because of its efficiency and ease of use. In fact, PSH <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/how-pumped-storage-hydropower-works"">currently accounts for 95% of all utility-scale energy storage capacity in the country.</a></p>

<p>PSH plants operate much like conventional hydropower plants, except PSH has the ability to use the same water over and over again. However, traditional PSH has drawbacks: it requires elevated terrain and <a href=""https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/04/f73/comparison-of-environmental-effects-open-loop-closed-loop-psh-1.pdf"">there are environmental concerns about ground- and surface water impacts</a>, so it is inherently geographically limited in its deployment.</p>

<p>Enter the company Quidnet Energy. Quidnet, working with researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, claims to have developed a novel approach to pumped hydropower that will solve these issues: <a href=""https://www.quidnetenergy.com/solution/"">Geomechanical Pumped Storage.</a></p>

<p><u>How Does it Work?</u></p>

<p>Stated very simply, Quidnet&rsquo;s Geomechanical Pumped Storage (GPS) system works by taking the ideas of PSH and literally inverting them by moving the storage underground. The system works in three steps: first, when electricity is abundant, the system pumps water from a pond down a well and into a thin lens of water contained in the bedrock. Second, the well is closed, keeping the energy stored under pressure between rock layers for as long as needed&ndash;usually one to two days. Third, when electricity is needed, the well is then opened to allow the pressurized water to pass through a turbine in order to generate electricity, and return to the pond ready for the next cycle. The natural elasticity of the rock <a href=""https://www.powermag.com/cps-energy-exploring-novel-geomechanical-pumped-storage-technology/"">performs like a spring</a> and holds the water under pressure until it is needed, at which time it is released through a hydroelectric turbine to produce electricity to send back to the grid. Quidnet describes themselves as an inverse fracking: the same technology is used, but instead of fracturing the bedrock, they seek to keep it sealed.</p>

<p>Quidnet has emphasized that its GPS system retains what works from traditional oil and gas drilling without the massive environmentally degrading impact. From their website, Quidnet states that their system &ldquo;is built on conventional drilling technology and off-the-shelf hydropower equipment. Facilities operate with closed-loop water systems, designed for conservation against evaporative loss. They also claim that there has been little-to-no fresh groundwater contamination due to several factors: first, being away from water wells, second, and the fact that their system is encased in concrete, and third, because they use farm-quality fresh water for their storage, so that even water that does escape does not carry the hydrocarbon or other water contamination that is involved with oil and gas fracking.</p>

<p>Quidnet also recognizes that the term &ldquo;fracking&rdquo; carries certain connotations and concerns, such as induced seismic events. Quidnet states that they avoid these concerns in two ways. First, their technology works at a much shallower level than oil and gas producing fracking: 1000-1500 feet subsurface, instead of the 5,000-20,000 feet below subsurface. Second, Quidnet states that, where they currently operate, they do not do their work near fault lines.</p>

<p>Quidnet has operations, in place or planned, in upstate New York, Texas, Ohio, California, and even Alberta in Canada. Recently, in March of 2022, Texas-based CPS Energy, the largest municipally-owned electric and natural gas company in the country, <a href=""https://www.powermag.com/cps-energy-exploring-novel-geomechanical-pumped-storage-technology/"">entered into a 15-year commercial agreement</a> to explore installing up to 15 MW of Quidnet&rsquo;s GPS system. The agreement will kick off with a 1-MW project that will pump water into drilled wells and store it under pressure, providing up to 10 hours of long-duration energy storage.</p>

<p><u>Can It Be Implemented in Pennsylvania?</u></p>

<p>While Quidnet touts their system as versatile and adaptable to the geological diversity of the United States, some regions are more favorable than others. Due to the geological makeup of Pennsylvania, especially in the Western portion of the Commonwealth, Quidnet believes our region could be the next great expansion for their subsurface storage system program.</p>

<div>Of course, Pennsylvania already has plenty of wells drilled: the DEP estimates that <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/PDFProvider.ashx?action=PDFStream&amp;docID=1419023&amp;chksum=&amp;revision=0&amp;docName=ABANDONED+AND+ORPHAN+OIL+AND+GAS+WELLS+AND+THE+WELL+PLUGGING+PROGRAM&amp;nativeExt=pdf&amp;PromptToSave=False&amp;Size=411528&amp;ViewerMode=2&amp;overlay=0"">there are between 100,000-560,000 abandoned and orphaned gas wells</a> left to clean up and plug across the state. As a result, one Quidnet representative accurately, if unflatteringly, described Pennsylvania&rsquo;s bedrock as &ldquo;swiss cheese.&rdquo; While one&rsquo;s initial reaction to hearing about Quidnet&rsquo;s plans to drill more might be that the last thing<span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>Pennsylvania needs is more holes in the ground, the good news is that Quidnet has reported to PennFuture that they actually have a way to utilize these wells. By using these pre-existing uncapped wells to help map and site locations for their GPS system, Quidnet can turn this potential liability into an asset. They call this the &ldquo;Clean Energy Geologic Resource Assessments&rdquo; (CEGRA) initiative. Quidnet hopes to double down on President Biden&rsquo;s efforts to find and cap orphaned wells by building out the orphaned well program to develop these new clean energy resources.</div>

<div><u>We Must Build a Green Energy Pennsylvanian Future</u></div>

<div></div>

<div>PennFuture <a href=""/Blog-Item-Its-Past-Time-for-Pennsylvania-to-Invest-in-Renewable-Energy"">has long called for a serious</a>, multifaceted local, state, and federal embrace of renewable energy in Pennsylvania. We believe it is crucial that our state divest from the environmentally harmful petrochemical buildout and refuse false solutions that merely temporarily keep the dying petrochemical industry alive. PennFuture has pointed to solar and wind power as clean energy alternatives to the dirty energy status quo. We are <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Basics-of-Hydrogen"">also monitoring other emerging technologies</a> such as green hydrogen. We are interested in the further research and development of other clean technologies like Geomechanical Pumped Storage, and believe tax dollars are better served exploring these areas instead of keeping harmful industries afloat.</div>

<div></div>

<div><u>Bottom Line</u></div>

<div></div>

<div>As we have explained <a href=""/Blog-Item-What-You-Wont-Hear-During-the-Aug-17-Public-Hearing-on-Pipelines-in-Pennsylvania"">in previous blogs</a>, green energy jobs are high-paying, reliable, and will continue into the future. Quidnet&rsquo;s GPS specifically uses much of the same machinery as traditional oil and gas fracking, meaning it can provide for a smooth transition for their workers. At the same time, Quidnet&rsquo;s GPS fundamentally avoids many of the environmental concerns of fracking. As traditional dirty energy wanes, it is imperative that Pennsylvania leads in the green collar revolution coming upon the horizon. Embracing alternative energy solutions will be key to building a new, green, economic present and future.</div>

Introducing PennFuture's New Legal Interns!,6/9/2022,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognized that we need to be more involved with cultivating the legal talent that will continue to support our mission. Our attorneys have a long history of mentoring legal interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.</p>

<p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor law students interested in making a difference for our environment.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting the State as well as to further their potential careers in environmental law. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.</p>

<p>This summer, we have a fantastic group of law students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We&rsquo;ve asked our new legal interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</p>

<p><u><strong>Kayla Shellenhamer, rising Third Year student at Widener University Commonwealth Law School</strong></u></p>

<p>I am going into my third final year at Widener Commonwealth, where I am pursuing a J.D. and the Environmental Law Certificate. At Widener, I am the Vice-President of the Environmental Law and<img  class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/kayla.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 151px; float: right;"" /> Policy Society.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate career, I really enjoyed my environmental science classes. As an extracurricular, I participated in environmental lobbying, which ignited my passion for change through policy. I graduated early with a degree in Environmental Writing and Policy.</p>

<p>To fill the semester between undergraduate and law school, I was able to Intern at the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. This allowed me to explore the inner workings of the legislative branch. I was able to author two original bills concerning food security, which were later introduced on the house floor. I enjoyed communicating with the public and seeing change through policy during my time at the House.</p>

<p>After my 1L year, I had the opportunity to intern at ProtectPT, a non-profit in Western PA. There, I was able to apply some of my legal skills to real-world problems. In my 2L year, I was able to take Environmental Law and Energy Law, which has allowed me to build knowledge in the specialized field. I am eager to continue my learning and experience at PennFuture this summer!</p>

<p><u><strong>Matthew Finnegan, rising Third Year student at Penn State Law</strong></u></p>

<p>Pursuing a J.D. and studying energy law, was not the path I had always envisioned myself going down. However, during my undergrad years, I learned about the issues of energy, from generation to<img  class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/matt.jpg"" style=""width: 115px; height: 150px; float: right;"" /> transmission, and fossil fuels to renewables, and how they are currently at the forefront of activity in PA, the place where I grew up and have spent most of my life. I have aimed my work to help the state propel its way into the future. I am so pleased to be an intern at PennFuture, where I am working with a group of people who are dedicated to keeping our state beautiful and safe.</p>

<p>I graduated from Wilkes University with my B.A., where I double majored in political science and international relations. I also picked up minors in history and women and gender studies while in undergrad. This is where my interest in energy and environmental issues began. My political studies were aimed at energy and public opinion regarding energy, working as a research assistant during a comparative study of fracking. I now attend Penn State University Law School, where I have been able to complete more research on hydrogen energy and wind power. At PennFuture I am learning firsthand of how energy and environmental law looks in practice while also completing meaningful work to help better the state.</p>

<p><u><strong>Joseph Feigin, rising Third Year student at Temple University Beasley School of Law</strong></u></p>

<p>Growing up, my parents instilled in me a deep appreciation for the outdoors. Wed take family trips to mountains and forests. I also heard the phrase &ldquo;you should go to law school&rdquo; a lot as a kid<img  class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/joe.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 150px; float: right;"" /> sowhen the time came for me to apply to college my senior year, I decided those adults were right. I attended the University of Pittsburgh to get my BA in Philosophy. During those four years my appreciation for the outdoors and, as a result, the environment prospered.</p>

<p>During my time there, I knew that I wanted to go to law school to become an environmental lawyer. It wouldnt be until my second year at Temple would I have the opportunity to actually do any legal environmental work. I spent a semester interning at the Clean Air Council. After that experience, I knew I made the right choice. My experience with CAC is what led me to PennFuture and I am thrilled to be spending my summer interning with so many talented environmental advocates.<br />
<br />
In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, photography, and spending time outdoors.</p>

"Renewable Energy Projects Have Our Support, but Not At Any Cost",6/8/2022,"<p>The science of climate change is unimpeachable: society must transition to a clean energy economy to immediately lower our carbon footprint, or face the consequences of irreversible damage to the only home we have.</p>

<p>As Pennsylvania&rsquo;s leading environmental advocacy organization, PennFuture works daily to help achieve that goal in a place that is <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2022/02/24/Pennsylvania-carbon-dioxide-emissions-increase-power-plants-coal-gas-RGGI-climate/stories/202202240077"">one of the most notorious carbon polluters</a> in the nation. What that means is fighting against the proliferation of fracking and petrochemicals and beating back attempts in Harrisburg to further tether our economy to heavy industry while advocating for solar and wind energy.</p>

<p>What it doesn&rsquo;t mean, however, is embracing renewable energy at any cost, or allowing developers to create a false dichotomy of pitting renewable energy projects against pristine waters and bountiful forests.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the proposed <a href=""https://www.swiftwatersolar.com/"">Swiftwater Solar project in the Poconos</a>, an 80-megawatt solar field that developers intend to build by clearcutting 470 acres of mature woodlands on the top of a mountain right next to an Exceptional Value stream in Pocono Township.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following PennFuture for a while, you know that our focus in Northeast PA is to help protect the headwaters of the Delaware River Watershed. And the stream at issue here &ndash; Swiftwater Creek &ndash; is one that <a href=""/Blog-Item-PennFuture-Celebrates-Legal-Victory-for-Exceptional-Value-Streams"">we have fought over already</a>, when these same development interests tried to strip away its Exceptional Value protections.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be labeled as Exceptional Value? For starters, only 2 percent of the thousands of streams and creeks in Pennsylvania have that designation based on the exceptional natural water quality and ecological value of the waters. Of that two percent labeled as Exceptional Value or &ldquo;EV&rdquo;, 80 percent are located in the Poconos. EV streams are unique and valuable resources, including outstanding trout fisheries that provide opportunities for recreation, aesthetic pleasure, and tourism.</p>

<p>PennFuture is in the business of transitioning to a clean energy economy, but we&rsquo;re also in the business of preserving these precious waters for generations to come. That&rsquo;s why PennFuture <a href=""/Files/Admin/2022-06-06-PF-Ltr-to-BOC-re-Swiftwater-Solar.pdf"">submitted comments to the Pocono Township board of commissioners</a> asking them to delay a final vote on the project and instead schedule a public hearing so community members and stakeholders could have a meaningful opportunity to present evidence and testimony of the impacts of Swiftwater Solar on the local environment. Unfortunately, the commissioners rejected that request and <a href=""https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/poconos-coal/proposed-solar-field-that-would-be-poconos-largest-gets-approval-despite-resident-concerns/article_10414d08-e60c-11ec-89d5-eb7817fcdc6b.html?fbclid=IwAR1DNE2TOU-c87PkuIMknlwGYxf-g5W0eDcpyPTMdzGLGPG1KyDNMM8qH-M"">approved the project at a meeting on June 6.</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that PennFuture doesn&rsquo;t stand alone in this fight. A poll <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.wordpress.com/2022/05/11/pocono-residents-support-more-action-to-protect-exceptional-value-streams-new-poll-finds/"">released by Our Pocono Waters in May</a> found strong support among Pocono residents for protecting the region&rsquo;s cleanest waters: 97% said that it was very important or somewhat important &ldquo;to protect and maintain Exceptional Value streams from added commercial development.&rdquo; Throughout the process, Brodhead Watershed Association <a href=""https://brodheadwatershed.org/wp-content/uploads/BWA-Swiftwater-Solar-Alert-Letter.pdf"">has been active in voicing its concerns</a> of the environmental impacts of this massive mountaintop project. As well, the Our Pocono Waters campaign submitted a letter <a href=""/Files/Admin/Our-Pocono-Waters---Swiftwater-Solar-Letter-1.pdf"">at the Planning Commission phase</a> expressing the need for more consideration on potential water quality impacts to the EV Swiftwater Creek. If PennFuture&rsquo;s call for a public hearing would have been headed, these concerns could have been put before the Township Commissioners for consideration. Instead these concerns went unheard, and the project moves forward. The deck was stacked against those who were worried about the impacts of this massive energy development project &ndash; as it often is at the land use level.</p>

<p>We realize that Swiftwater Solar was determined to be an &ldquo;essential service&rdquo; under the local zoning ordinance and that, as a result, it was a permissible use for this property. We acknowledge that Apex Energy, the designer of the project, is one of the leading green energy companies in the US and we support the work they &ndash; and companies like them &ndash; do to develop more renewable energy projects across the Commonwealth. We need more solar development in Pennsylvania. But it has to be more thoughtful than that.</p>

<p>We must have responsible renewable energy development. And we must protect sensitive natural resource areas. These must not become mutually exclusive. We must not play into the fallacy that we can only have one. We must not be forced to pit our environmental interests against one another. There are best practices for siting renewable energy projects - and, unfortunately in the case of Swiftwater Solar, we just don&rsquo;t see how clearcutting almost 500 acres of trees on top of a steep mountain in an EV watershed is a good idea.</p>

<p>And so while PennFuture continues to fight for increased renewable energy projects, while we champion our legislature to put money behind the development of large scale solar and wind instead of fracked gas outlets, and while we embrace federal, state, and local laws that encourage renewable energy, we must remain vigilant that renewable energy developers look for thoughtful siting locations and design elements that preserve rather than destroy sensitive natural resources. Pennsylvanians should not be forced into choosing one at the expense of the other.</p>

"PA Environmental Leaders, State Senators Discuss the Failure of Shale Gas Policies and Negative Public Health Impacts of Industry",6/7/2022,"<p>On June 2nd, State Senator Katie Muth, chair of the Pennsylvania Senate Democratic Policy Committee, joined Senator Jim Brewster, Senator Lindsey Williams, and Senator Jay Costa at CCAC&rsquo;s Boyce Campus in Monroeville to hosta public hearing on state policy and health impacts of the shale gas industry in Pennsylvania. The hearing, entitled <em>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Shale Gas Boom: How Policy Decisions Failed to Protect Public Health and What We Can Do to Correct It</em>, focused on the health impacts of shale gas infrastructure in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The hearing included testimony from impacted residents, public health and policy experts, and environmental advocacy leaders. Environmental Health Project (EHP), whose leadership was present, recently released <a href=""https://www.environmentalhealthproject.org/_files/ugd/a9ce25_92b1ee87271140d5b9f93e174cfc849c.pdf"">a white paper of the same name.</a></p>

<p>Specifically, the panelists included Gillian Graber, Executive Director, Protect PT; Cathy Lodge, Washington County resident; Mackenzie White, Public Health Manager, EHP; Dr. Brian Schwartz, Professor of Environmental Health and Engineering, Epidemiology, and Medicine, Johns Hopkins University; Lisa Graves-Marcucci, Pennsylvania Coordinator, Community Outreach, Environmental Integrity Project (EIP); and Alison L. Steele, Executive Director, EHP.</p>

<p>Much of the hearing included very personal accounts of the negative impacts of petrochemical buildout in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Each speaker lived close to, and interacted daily with, a fracked gas well or facility. In her testimony,<a href=""https://www.senatormuth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gillian-Graber-Written-Testimony.pdf"">Graber cited an operator</a> with hundreds of recorded violations to health, safety and the environment, on record with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, being permitted to build 4 well pads less than a mile from a school in her area. Another operator, also with hundreds of documented violations, is also permitted to build a well pad 1,500 feet from a school. Ms. Lodge stated <a href=""https://www.senatormuth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cathy-Lodge-Written-Testimony.pdf"">in her testimony</a> that the <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/fort-cherry-schools-another-gas-drilling-permit/"">Fort Cherry school district in Washington County</a> is surrounded by 40 fracked gas wells.</p>

<p>When discussing policy solutions to better protect public health, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and Department of Health (DOH) were frequently mentioned. Specifically, the panelists agreed that the DEP was by and large not enforcing regulations partially due to a lack of staffing.</p>

<p>Senator Williams asked how DEP and DOH could be improved. Lisa Graves-Marcucci from EIP cited that, while she knows many well-intentioned DEP staff, there exists a revolving door between the petrochemical industry and DEP, as highlighted in State Attorney General Shapiro&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/43rd-statewide-grand-jury-finds-pennsylvania-failed-to-protect-citizens-during-fracking-boom/"">43rd Grand Jury Report.</a> Ms. Marcucci also cited <a href=""http://www.depgreenport.state.pa.us/elibrary/GetDocument?docId=4221701&amp;DocName=ENVIRONMENTAL%20JUSTICE%20POLICY.PDF%20%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:green%3b%22%3eCOMMENTS%20DUE%20MAY%2011%2c%202022%3c/span%3e%20%3cspan%20style%3D%22color:blue%3b%22%3e%28NEW%29%3c/span%3e"">DEP&rsquo;s proposed draft Environmental Justice policy</a> (in which <a href=""/Blog-Item-DEPs-Revised-Environmental-Justice-Policy-A-Good-Start-but-More-Needs-to-Be-Done-to-Protect-PAs-Environmental-Justice-Communities"">PennFuture submitted comments</a>), stating that to her knowledge the DEP has not denied permits in 25 years.</p>

<p>Marcucci also stated that health and safety boards need their composition examined, as she sees petrochemical industry influence throughout the organization.Finally, Marcucci recommended that more municipalities should consider high corporate bonds tied to specific projects, citing ordinances in Indiana Township and Smith Township in Allegheny and Washington Counties, respectively.</p>

<p>Steele stated that the DOH has been silent on this issue of public health concerns from fracking, especially when they have been vocal and effective in addressing other issues like COVID-19. Steele also believes that there is a lack of clear mandate to address this issue; DOH should be empowered to take on the negative health effects of the petrochemical buildout. Specifically, DOH should take a firmer stance on the issue, give information to residents on chemicals used, provide guidance to residents on how to protect their health, and provide guidance to health professionals and how to provide a robust response to patients when health concerns related to the issue arises.</p>

<p>Senator Williams added that DEP and DOH employees need increased whistleblower protections: the ability to recover attorneys fees after a suit, reinstatement, and other protections and incentives to speak out which currently are not afforded under state law.</p>

<p>All panelists agreed: with the conversation around hydrogen beginning in Pennsylvania, we must not repeat the mistakes from the fracking boom. We need to ask all the questions upfront &ndash; especially how it will impact the health and safety of residents.</p>

The True Cost of Convenience: The Impacts of Never-Ending Warehouse Development,5/31/2022,"<p>There are costs to irresponsible, endless development. The current trend in Pennsylvanias area of the Delaware River Basin is the expansion of massive warehouses and logistics centers. With these projects come the subsequent increase in truck traffic, diesel fumes, infrastructure damage, and stormwater runoff. Warehouses and logistics centers have severe consequences for the health of the surrounding communities and the environment, and very few benefits.</p>

<p>Driven by the convenience (and safety) of online shopping and the expectation of receiving goods within 24hours of clicking a button, developers are purchasing land for the sole purpose of building these behemoths. Now, the expansion of the warehouse house empire is beginning to branch north from the current distribution hub of the East Coast - the Lehigh Valley.</p>

<p>Folks living in the quiet, rural communities of the Pocono Mountains are witnessing hundreds of thousands of square feet of forest and wetlands get paved over and transformed into cubes of convenient consumption. These communities are shocked and dismayed, fighting to protect the pristine landscape and unique biodiversity that characterizes the region. Oftentimes, they say that they dont want their region to mirror the distribution hub of Lehigh Valley.</p>

<p>And with good reason. Online shopping created a distribution and logistics bubble thats continued to grow for the last ten to fifteen years in the third largest metropolitan area of Pennsylvania. The distribution economy <a href=""https://www.city-journal.org/pennsylvania-lehigh-valley-supply-chain-empire"">has created over 30,000 jobs across Northampton and Lehigh counties</a>. Thats a lot - about 11% of local residents are employed in the industry. But these jobs come at a high price.</p>

<p>While developers are offered tax breaks, taxpayers end up covering the cost of damaged infrastructure and the increased need for municipal services. Whats more is that communities thatalready experience the impacts of pollution, heat deserts, and a lack of green space are exposed to increased diesel fumes from heavy truck traffic. In 2021, Allentown was considered the &quot;Asthma Capital&quot; of the Northeast Mid-Atlantic region, according to the <a href=""https://www.aafa.org/asthma-capitals/"">Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America</a>. Their studies show that the combined issues of exposure to industrial businesses and high-traffic roads with a lack of access to asthma specialists primes residents for this illness. Because we know that communities of color more often than not bear the burden of the cumulative impacts of pollution, it should not be surprising that the citys population is 54% Latino and 13% Black or African American. Yes, this industry provides jobs, but at what cost? And to whom?</p>

<p>Some wonder if whats touted as &quot;economic growth&quot; is as robust as it seems. According to local officials in Lower Macungie Township - a community outside of the city of Allentown - &quot;If a warehouse employs 100 people but eats up 100 acres of farmland, the Valley economy <a href=""https://www.city-journal.org/pennsylvania-lehigh-valley-supply-chain-empire"">only nets one job per acre of precious land lost.&quot;</a> This is not an efficient use of land, especially when considering the loss of ecological services provided by that land. The impervious surface - or pavement and buildings - created by warehouses and distribution centers increases stormwater runoff, which then increases the intensity and frequency of flooding. Rather than soil and plants soaking up the rain, the water sheds right off, inundating streets, storm sewers, and creeks. And once again, the communities that experience the most flooding in the Lehigh Valley tend to be Black and brown communities. The environmental impacts continue to accumulate.</p>

<p>It is a different picture in the Poconos, however. There is a lot of open space, fresh air, and clean streams. Wetlands and forests abound - for now.</p>

<p>For Pocono residents, the development of warehouses and distribution centers threatens the character of their rural communities, the health of pristine streams, and the prospect of generational wealth.</p>

<p>Over 30% of Pennsylvanias waterways are polluted and degraded. However, there are pockets of clean, pristine creeks and streams, but they are few. Only 2% of Pennsylvanias waterways are healthy enough to receive the DEPs special designation of Exceptional Value. These are the cleanest, healthiest streams in the state. They have intact and abundant ecosystems and contain pure water. 80% of them can be found in the mountain, wetlands, and forests of the Poconos.</p>

<p>According to an industry white paper, warehouse developers are looking to northeastern Pennsylvania to expand their empire for a few reasons - decrease in unionization of workers, lower wages, low taxes, <a href=""https://mericlereadytogo.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/distribution-white-paper-mweb.pdf"">and the land is cheap and abundant.</a> While all of that is good for profit, it is very bad for the communities and the environment. Recent plans brought in front of municipalities demonstrate a willingness to build along Exceptional Value streams, which if done poorly, could permanently reduce water quality, threaten wildlife, and increase flooding.</p>

<p>The prevalence of warehouses reduces land values. Folks that live in the Poconos tend to have long-term ties to the region. For some, their house and property is their single source of wealth. Its been passed down through their family. But when a warehouse or distribution center abuts the property line, land value suddenly drops.</p>

<p>There are no guarantees that these massive buildings - usually 250,000 square feet or more - will be filled with whats called an &quot;end user&quot;. Its all speculative. Developers may pave over wetlands and impair trout streams without ever placing a business in the building. There are some along Route 512 that have stood empty for years. Thats likely to continue if Amazons business trends are any indication. The online shopping giant is starting to lease its space because it is unable to use it. The distribution bubble is on its way to bursting. But because of the flawed land use and development process currently in place, developers dont need to guarantee business in order to build.</p>

<p>Local government officials in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos realize that land use laws and zoning codes need to change to put an end to this expansion. The Municipal Planning Code was originally established to protect the health, safety, and character of communities. Every municipality must allow for every &quot;use&quot; included in the MPC. However, developers are taking advantage of the term &quot;warehouse&quot;. When the term was initially included, distribution centers that take up one million square feet of land and boast 300-400 truck trips were inconceivable. But because the term is included in the zoning codes, the use must be allowed. Thats why municipal leaders <a href=""https://www.city-journal.org/pennsylvania-lehigh-valley-supply-chain-empire"">are calling on state legislators to take action and change the codes.</a></p>

<p>When we allow for the pervasive and unchecked development of warehouses,we are choosing corporate profits and convenient consumption over healthy communities and a healthy environment.</p>

<p>On May 11, 2022, PennFuture submitted two public comments on the proposed revision (see <a href=""/Files/Admin/RecommendationsDraftEJPolicy_05112022_Final.docx.pdf"">here</a> and <a href=""/Files/Admin/CAC-PF-EIP-MWA-PE-EJ-Poly-Comments---Doc-No-012-0501-002.pdf"">here</a>). As I outline below, DEP&rsquo;s Policy, while a great and necessary start, focuses only on informing the community of the potential for more pollution from a new facility while failing to do anything to prevent that increased pollution burden to the community. In short, DEP must make this policy a regulation and must deny permits that could disproportionately harm EJ communities.</p>

<p><u>What is Environmental Justice?</u></p>

<p>Environmental Justice is <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/learn-about-environmental-justice"">defined by the US EPA</a> as &ldquo;the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies.&rdquo; The purpose of EJ is to rectify and bring justice to those communities that have long suffered a disproportionate burden of pollution based on race, income, and other institutionalized factors <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/redlining"">such as redlining</a> and <a href=""/Blog-Item-More-than-Skin-Deep-Environmental-Racism-Justice-and-Pennsylvania"">environmental racism</a>. Also known as <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114843/#:~:text=Sacrifice%20zones%20are%20often%20%E2%80%9Cfenceline,polluted%20industries%20or%20military%20bases."">&ldquo;sacrifice zones,&rdquo;</a> EJ communities include the frontline and fence-line communities where there is a disproportionate concentration of toxic facilities and other pollution sources.</p>

<p>DEP <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/OfficeofEnvironmentalJustice/Pages/PA-Environmental-Justice-Areas.aspx"">defines an EJ Area</a> as a community where at least 20% of the population have incomes below the federal poverty line and/or 30% identify as non-white. DEP has created an <a href=""https://padep-1.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=f31a188de122467691cae93c3339469c"">Environmental Justice Area Viewer</a> to help communities, applicants, and agencies identify EJ Areas and &ldquo;Areas of Concern&rdquo; for which its Public Participation Policy applies. Under this policy DEP limits the Area of Concern in the EJ community to a 0.5-mile radius from the proposed facility.</p>

<p><u>What is DEP&rsquo;s Environmental Justice Public Participation Policy?</u></p>

<p>First off, what is a DEP &ldquo;policy&rdquo;? DEP policies are written, nonbinding documents that outline procedures that Department and others may put in place and actions they may take to meet the requirements of an environmental law or outline key practices of an agency or organization. Policies can be viewed as guidance for the agency. As the DEP explains, the law (statutes, regulations) tells the agency what to do and the policy says how DEP should do it. Consequently, unlike laws, there is no legal recourse should DEP fail to follow its own policies.</p>

<p>As the name denotes, DEP&rsquo;s EJ Public Participation Policy is limited to outlining the actions that DEP should take to reach out to and receive feedback from EJ communities. In short, this policy includes (but is not limited to) the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A process for identifying permits applications that would trigger this policy or otherwise cause this policy to apply</li>
	<li>A process for informing residents in an EJ Area that an applicant is applying for a permit from DEP to build, operate, or modify a facility that will impact the public health or the environment, including through public hearings and information sessions</li>
	<li>A process for receiving feedback from impacted residents and responding in writing to that feedback</li>
	<li>Specific processes for public engagement on the permitting of oil and gas facilities</li>
	<li>Definitions of key terms such as &ldquo;environmental justice area&rdquo;, &ldquo;area of concern&rdquo;, &ldquo;trigger permits&rdquo;, and &ldquo;opt-in permits&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p><u>DEP Must Strengthen Its EJ Policy</u></p>

<p>The most fundamental problem with DEP&rsquo;s Policy is that it does not specifically call on DEP to deny permits that would disproportionately harm or add to the already disproportionate pollution burden of EJ communities. DEP has clear statutory and constitutional authority and duty to shape the substantive outcomes of the permitting process and without recognizing and setting forth this authority, the Policy fails to promote the fair treatment or meaningful involvement of all Pennsylvanians.</p>

<p>This is not to say that we don&rsquo;t encourage and support DEP doing everything it can to have a robust and inclusive public participation process regarding permitting of polluting facilities in EJ communities. Education, outreach, understanding, and listening are critical elements of the public participation process that for too long have been denied to frontline and fence-line communities. Making the process easier to understand and navigate is essential to overcome the long history of ignoring the health and concerns of these overburdened, under-resourced, and often dismissed communities. DEP must do everything it can to communicate with and listen to EJ communities.</p>

<p>However, if all DEP does is receive input from an EJ community, without changing the course based on that input, then it can only continue to perpetuate the disproportionate impact on the communities. DEP must give these communities the power to reject facilities and must be able to deny permits that will contribute additional pollution. To achieve &ldquo;fair treatment&rdquo; of &ldquo;all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income,&rdquo; DEP must prevent (and reverse) the buildup of cumulative and disparate harms on black and brown communities, immigrant communities, and low-income communities, even if each application it receives appears to comply with other regulatory requirements. To achieve &ldquo;meaningful involvement,&rdquo; the public&rsquo;s comments and opposition must be able to change the outcome of DEP&rsquo;s decisionmaking.</p>

<p>Moreover, DEP must establish formal EJ regulations &ndash; whichhave the full force of law &ndash; that protect EJ communities from additional polluting facilities. Again, while this Policy is better than before, leaving EJ to a policy robs communities of the ability to hold DEP accountable for any failure to protect EJ communities. Additionally, industry will take such a rule more seriously than a policy, and DEP could actually require applicants to provide DEP with the information it needs to meaningfully advance environmental justice. Finally, a rule can empower Pennsylvanians suffering from environmental injustice to fight for their future: while a policy may encourage public comment, residents can enforce a rule through appeals or other legal action.</p>

<p>Barring these two critical factors to DEP truly protecting the health and environmental rights of EJ communities, our comments also offered a number of changes that could improve the Policy to better protect the health of EJ communities, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Better and more meaningful ways to identify and include communities that need environmental justice;</li>
	<li>Expanding the geographic scope of &ldquo;Areas of Concern&rdquo; to appropriately capture the impact of the pollution from many common types of facilities;</li>
	<li>A more inclusive definition of the types of permits that trigger the application of the Policy;</li>
	<li>A more inclusive and robust application of &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo; permits;</li>
	<li>Providing for better accessibility to permit applications, documents, and information, including providing a dedicated website for EJ-related permit applications and documents and easy access to electronic documents;</li>
	<li>An automatic extension of the 30-day public comment period, especially when requested by the public, and more inclusive and robust access to public hearings;</li>
	<li>Fair compensation for community liaisons;</li>
	<li>Develop and strengthen partnerships and meaningful relationships with frontline and fence-line communities;</li>
	<li>Develop educational materials and presentations to better inform communities as to this policy and other agency and regulatory processes and how to engage in them; and</li>
	<li>Independent verification by DEP of whether the facility would impact an EJ Area or Area of Concern.</li>
</ul>

<p>DEP is currently reviewing the comments it received from the public.We call on the Department to center the voices, concerns, and comments of frontline, fence-line, and environmental justice communities and organizations. We hope that DEP takes seriously its duty to protect EJ communities from further harm, and will continue to explore opportunities to elevate, coordinate with, and represent Environmental Justice communities in Pennsylvania.</p>

Exhibiting Art and Fighting Climate Change,5/18/2022,"<p><em>Photo Credit: A hologram of Edgar Degass Petite danseuse de quatorze ans (1927), previously on view at Christies San Francisco and Hong Kong branches. Courtesy of Christies.</em></p>

<p>More than 25 years ago I argued in my Master&rsquo;s thesis, for Art Education at Penn State, that art museums should create virtual museums online to increase their accessibility and improve their educational outreach. If I was to write that thesis today it would be somewhat different. First off, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have to include a chapter on what the &ldquo;World Wide Web&rdquo; is or how a hyperlink works. More importantly though, I would devote much of the thesis to how art museums can embrace virtual technology to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>

<p>Its hard to imagine, but back in the mid-nineties there was actually a lot of resistance in the art world to even posting digital photographs of works from their collections online. The concern, for some, was that when an original work of art is &ldquo;mechanically&rdquo; reproduced it becomes inferior to the original, destroying what critic Walter Benjamin called its &ldquo;aura&rdquo; which diminishes the viewers experience of both the original and the reproduction. Others were worried that the dollar value of original works would be compromised if viewers could &ldquo;steal&rdquo; (or copy and save) images. Given the ridiculous growth of the global art market since, <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/1119/art-market/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20global%20art%20market,(COVID%2D19)%20pandemic."">currently valued at $65.1 billion dollars annually</a>, I think the industry is doing just fine.</p>

<p>I thought back to my thesis while reading an article about how <a href=""https://news.artnet.com/market/christies-touring-edgar-degas-hologram-around-world-advance-anne-bass-sale-2104580"">the auction house Christie&rsquo;s has created an incredibly realistic hologram</a> of a fragile Degas ballerina sculpture, valued at $20 million, that they are sending on a virtual world tour. I haven&rsquo;t seen the actual hologram in person but the photograph of it is indistinguishable from a photograph of the original work. It&rsquo;s an amazing use of the technology <a href=""https://www.portlhologram.com/"">created by a company called Proto</a> to beam high resolution holograms of actual people around the world. Christie&rsquo;s has chosen to use the tech primarily to reduce shipping and insurance costs, but also, they say, because it reduces their carbon footprint. This is a concern that unfortunately few people in the art world had back in the nineties, when I was in grad school, but is now on the forefront of everyone&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been with PennFuture <a href=""/Blog-Item-Artists-Interpreting-Climate-Change-Part-3"">I&rsquo;ve written a number of blogs</a> about how &ldquo;EcoArtists&rdquo; are creating works that use the environment as a subject matter, as a medium, and sometimes as a result of their work. Most recently <a href=""https://youtu.be/jdZ9ZxwV47Y"">I hosted an online panel discussion</a> with a number of artists involved in creating the book EcoArt in Action. For this article I want to focus specifically on how the exhibitors of art - museums, galleries, and auction houses such as Christie&rsquo;s - are addressing their role in climate change.</p>

<p>Climate change, and its effects, are certainly on the radar of museum professionals today. The <a href=""https://www.pamm.org/about/building"">P&eacute;rez Art Museum</a>, recently built on the bay in Miami and the <a href=""https://www.aam-us.org/2020/12/11/facing-the-rising-tide-how-the-whitney-museum-of-american-art-addresses-resiliency-and-storm-preparedness-through-design"">Whitney Museum of American Art&rsquo;s Renzo Piano</a>, located next to the Hudson River, were both designed to withstand predicted flooding caused by climate change. Last year the <a href=""https://noma.org/hurricane-ida-update/"">New Orleans Museum of Art</a> had to close to the public for a few weeks because of Hurricane Ida and get their power from emergency generators to keep the steady temperature and humidity needed to protect their collection. Fortunately, because of lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina, they had an extreme weather event plan in place. Other museums have taken notice. Today there is even a regular conference for museum professionals on protecting their collections, and buildings, from increased flooding called <a href=""https://historyabovewater.org/"">Keeping History Above Water.</a></p>

<p>But what can galleries and museums do to not just protect themselves but to actually reduce their carbon footprint?</p>

<p>Some museums are making significant efforts to be more sustainable, such as getting Leadership in Energy and environmental Design (LEED) certification for their buildings. LEED provides a framework for healthy, highly efficient, and cost-saving green buildings. In Pennsylvania both the Erie Art Museum and the Barnes Foundation, among others, are LEED certified. <a href=""https://blooloop.com/sustainability/in-depth/sustainable-museums/"">Here is a list</a> of the top 17 sustainable museums in the world, including one of my favorites, the Grand Rapids Art Museum in Michigan.</p>

<p>These architectural efforts in building design are extremely important but they don&rsquo;t reduce the amount of energy used to transport art &ndash; which is where the art world has the greatest impact on the environment. The costs for packaging and shipping art (think lots of bubble wrap and crates, cargo ships and airplanes, security and couriers, plus insurance) for a &ldquo;blockbuster&rdquo; touring exhibition to museums around the globe can be extraordinary. Individual museums will often pay anywhere from around a hundred thousand to a few million just for the transportation of paintings. Transporting sculptures weighing thousands of pounds can cost even more. The trend of museums offering &ldquo;immersive&rdquo; experiences is certainly a result of this consideration &ndash; it is much less costly (for the museum and the environment) to project images of Van Gogh on a gallery wall than it is to ship all those artworks to multiple museums. And given their popularity, audiences are apparently okay with not seeing the original if they can walk through a reproduction.</p>

<p>Perhaps the worst climate offenders in the art world are the huge international fairs, such as Art Basel Miami, the Frieze Art Fair in London and New York, and Art Dubai. When you take into account the climate footprint of building temporary exhibition spaces, with energy sucking lighting and climate control, and the thousands of international jet-setters flying in and out to these events, the environmental impact can be devastating. Acknowledging the carbon footprint of the hundreds of art fairs held each year is something the art world <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/c8f21a30-8386-11e9-a7f0-77d3101896ec"">has just started to get comfortable in talking about.</a></p>

<p>Of course exhibitors can&rsquo;t reduce their footprint unless they know how big it is. One group taking the lead on helping the art world do this is the <a href=""https://galleryclimatecoalition.org/"">Gallery Climate Coalition</a>. Their goal is to facilitate the decarbonization of the visual art sector and promote zero-waste practices. This international collective of hundreds of art professionals has a plan to reduce the carbon emissions from galleries, museums, and fairs by at least 50% by 2030 (in line with the Paris Agreement). One way they do this is by providing a <a href=""https://galleryclimatecoalition.org/carbon-calculator/"">free online carbon calculator</a> to determine the footprint of transporting artworks to exhibits, fairs, and festivals. Last November they hosted, online, the conference &ldquo;Decarbonizing the Art World&rdquo; and published their <a href=""https://cdn.flowcode.com/prodassets/GCC_DECARBONISATION_ACTION_PLAN_2021.pdf?ts=1637663739637018874"">&ldquo;Decarbonization Action Plan&rdquo;</a>. Most of their suggested actions recognize that the art world is not going to give up the physical object anytime soon and therefore the tips are practical, physical, ways to reduce waste and energy consumption such as using LED lighting, reusable crates, and recycling packing material. They also promote decarbonization through innovation, such as utilizing virtual exhibits.</p>

<p>Though the early concerns from the art world about jeopardizing an artwork&rsquo;s &ldquo;aura&rdquo; have not prevented museums from being online, there were still some who resisted creating virtual exhibitions for a number of years because the poor quality of the technology compromised the visitor&rsquo;s experience. As the technology improved this became less of an issue, yet many museums still were reluctant to embrace virtual exhibitions because of a fear it would reduce revenue from in-person visits. What has been encouraging to see during the past two years is that because of Covid restrictions many museums and galleries, who couldn&rsquo;t open their physical doors, were &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; into having virtual versions of their physical exhibits to be able to continue to reach their audiences. A great example of this is <a href=""https://www.seattleartmuseum.org/Pages/our-blue-planet-global-visions-of-water.aspx"">&ldquo;Our Blue Planet: Global Visions of Water&rdquo;</a> created by the Seattle Art Museum and featuring works from the museum&rsquo;s permanent collection or on loan from local collectors &ndash; minimizing transportation costs of the art.</p>

<p>Something many museums have recently realized was that these virtual exhibits allowed them to reach a far broader audience while reducing exhibition costs and their carbon footprint. In fact, so many arts institutions started to create virtual content during the past two years that Google launched <a href=""https://artsandculture.google.com/"">Google Arts and Culture</a> in partnership with them as a response. Here you can &ldquo;visit&rdquo; almost every major art museum in the world, including the Met, MoMA, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, without having to get in a plane, train, or car.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the past few years have also seen one of the greatest upheavals in the world of virtual art with the popularity of cryptocurrency and Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). When I first heard about these &ldquo;digital markers&rdquo; and how they could be used to identify the one &ldquo;original&rdquo; image in a world of digital copies I was certainly intrigued. For the first time, artists who work in the digital world could make truly unique images that were protected with this certification of authenticity. It sounded like a great idea. I&rsquo;m not going to dwell on this too much here because I wanted this blog to focus on the positive changes the art world has been making regarding climate change. NFTs are not a part of it. Unfortunately, NFTs are a huge step backwards environmentally because they rely on &ldquo;blockchains&rdquo; and the ridiculous amount of energy required to run the computers creating them and cryptocurrency (a much better explanation of how this all works <a href=""/Blog-Item-Terrible-Excuses-to-Mine-Bitcoin"">was written by my co-worker, Rob Altenburg)</a>. It&rsquo;s a shame that the amount of money associated with NFTs at this point is so great &ndash; <a href=""https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/pursuits/art-culture/nfts-quiet-revolution-art-world/"">literally billions during the past year</a> -that many people are choosing to ignore their environmental impact. Someday there may be a way to sustainably create NFTs, but it is a long way away from today&rsquo;s technology.</p>

<p>Despite my serious concerns about NFTs I am greatly encouraged by the responsibility that museums and galleries are taking for their role in fighting climate change and reducing their carbon footprint. And I can&rsquo;t wait to see how this new hologram technology will be used by museums, galleries, and artists to show and create works all around the world without damaging the Earth. It is certainly not something I could have predicted some 25 years ago.</p>

New Solar Energy Discoveries Suggest an Even Brighter Renewable Energy Future,5/8/2022,"<p>In 2017, Dr. Kasper Moth-Poulson and his team at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden made headlines with their<a href=""https://newatlas.com/most-transportable-solar-energy-storage/48596/""> breakthrough discovery</a> that solar energy can be stored as a liquid for up to 18 years and be released as heat when needed. In the last several weeks, Moth-Poulson&rsquo;s team has made a further discovery &ndash; the <a href=""https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/04/12/solar-energy-can-now-be-stored-for-up-to-18-years-say-scientists"">stored solar energy can produce electricity </a>by connecting it to a thermoelectric generator.</p>

<p>In a time where the severe consequences of climate change is looking increasingly unavoidable &ndash; largely caused by our almost singular reliance on dirty energy past and present &ndash; the world is scrambling for alternatives to our current energy consumption habits.</p>

<p>Solar energy is becoming increasingly affordable and abundant. Last year, the United States added nearly <a href=""https://irena.org/publications/2022/Apr/Renewable-Capacity-Statistics-2022"">20 GigaWatts of solar capacity. </a>Advancements in solar energy research and development could further expedite the rise of renewable energy.</p>

<p>Rather than debate how we can best expand solar energy across Pennsylvania, discussions have focused on questionable technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage (also referred to as &ldquo;CCUS&rdquo;). <a href=""/Blog-Item-Chasing-the-Rainbow-Carbon-Capture-is-Magic-Thinking"">PennFuture recently published a blog</a> where we warned about leaning too heavily into CCUS, as it has not proven to be the effective, climate-friendly solution as advertised. This is especially the case when comparing CCUS to other green alternative energy sources.</p>

<p>Unlike solar energy, CCUS relies on existing and sustained environmentally-degrading carbon output. Solar energy is infinitely renewable and virtually entirely clean. The solar energy system created at Chalmers, also known as Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage Systems or &ldquo;MOST&rdquo;, provides a fascinating and promising future for both solar and the green alternative energy space as a whole.</p>

<p>As it stands today, solar energy provides <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OfficeofPollutionPrevention/SolarFuture/Pages/Pennsylvania%27s-Solar-Future-Plan.aspx"">less than 1 percent of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s electricity.</a> There is clearly room for the growth of the Pennsylvania green energy sector, and state government officials have begun to take notice. In March 2021, Governor Tom Wolf announced a <a href=""https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-announces-largest-government-solar-energy-commitment-in-the-u-s/"">clean energy initiative </a>that would produce nearly 50 percent of the state government&rsquo;s electricity from solar.</p>

<p>Increased state investment in solar would not only be beneficial for our environment, it can also kickstart the Pennsylvania economy. Proof of this already exists. <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Energy/Office of Energy and Technology/OETDPortalFiles/2020EnergyReport/2020PACEIR.pdf"">The 2020 Pennsylvania Clean Energy Employment report</a> showed that clean energy industries (overall) added nearly 7,800 jobs in Pennsylvania in 2017-2019, for an 8.7 percent average job growth rate, significantly exceeding the average overall job growth in the state. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s solar workforce grew by 8.3 percent, well above the state average job growth rate.</p>

<p>Leaning heavily into solar simply makes sense from a consumer, environmental, and broader economic sense. On average, most residents can save between<a href=""https://www.solar-nation.org/Pennsylvania""> $200 to $800 </a>on their utility bills each year by leasing or buying a solar panel system. While Pennsylvania does not currently offer any state tax credits for solar energy, some can receive at least a 22% Federal solar tax credit. Pennsylvania does provide<a href=""https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/pa""> cost-saving programs </a>to assist those who want to transition to solar power for their homes.</p>

<p>Solar, along with other renewable energy, is now the cheapest it has ever been in history. So why have we not embraced it with open arms? It would require a lot of dismantling of status-quo policies that keep fossil fuels profitable despite their decline. In fact, the regulatory structure of utilities actually makes it more profitable to keep a coal or fossil fuel plant running. <a href=""http://marcellusmoney.org/about"">With fossil fuel companies bankrolling elected officials</a> to keep <a href=""/News-Buried-Out-of-Sight-PennFuture-Releases-New-Report-that-Shines-Light-on-Massive-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Doled-out-in-Pennsylvania"">fossil fuel tax breaks</a> in place, the much-need Just Transition has been continuously delayed.</p>

<p>Taking climate change seriously, through significant investment in research, development, and implementation can result in breakthroughs with worldwide implications &ndash; as seen with the constant achievements of Dr. Moth-Poulson and his team in Sweden. Pennsylvania is at an economic crossroads, rebuilding after a pandemic and the decline of traditional dirty energy which once built the Commonwealth. Green, clean, alternative energy can provide good paying (union) jobs, research opportunities for our world-renowned universities, and a cleaner environment for our Commonwealth.</p>

Pennsylvania Finally Caps Carbon Pollution From Power Plants: Now What?,5/3/2022,"<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s plans to cut carbon pollution from fossil fuel power plants took a big step forward on April 23. After many delays, the Legislative Reference Bureau published the final CO2 Budget Trading Program, also known as the<a href=""http://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pabull?file=/secure/pabulletin/data/vol52/52-17/625.html"" target=""_blank""> &ldquo;Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Rule.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>This means that, after years of work &ndash; with considerable input from the public &ndash; the program Governor Tom Wolf announced with Executive Order 2019-07 back in October 2019 will finally go into effect. Pennsylvania willstart to limit the carbon pollution from fossil fuel electric generation.</p>

<p><strong>How RGGI Will Work for Pennsylvania</strong></p>

<p>Under RGGI, each participating state decides how much carbon pollution they will allow, otherwise known as a &ldquo;cap.&rdquo; For each ton of carbon emissions allowed under that cap, the states create an &ldquo;allowance.&rdquo; Operators of large electric generators &mdash; like a coal or fracked gas power plant &mdash; must obtain one allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) they emit, most of which will likely be purchased at quarterly RGGI auctions. </p>

<p>Each state will get a share of auction proceeds commensurate with their auction allowances. States can choose how they want to invest the money. The first auction that Pennsylvania power plants will participate in is scheduled for September 7, 2022.</p>

<p>Under existing Pennsylvania law, namely the Air Pollution Control Act, proceeds will be deposited in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)&rsquo;s Clean Air Fund for use in programs or initiatives that further reduce air pollution. </p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania Power Plants Won&rsquo;t Have to Pay for All Their Pollution Right Away</strong></p>

<p>The RGGI program runs on a three-calendar-year &ldquo;control period&rdquo; with each of the first two years serving as &ldquo;interim control periods.&rdquo; Power plants eventually need to obtain allowances for each ton of CO2 they emit during the entire control period. But they don&rsquo;t need them all right away. For each of the interim control periods, they only need allowances for half of their emissions.</p>

<p>Because of the delay in starting the program, Pennsylvania will start participating in the RGGI auctions in the middle of 2022, part way through one of the three-year control periods. What this means is, for 2022, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s electric generators will only need to obtain credits for carbon pollution they emit between July 1 and the end of the year. Also, since 2022 is the second interim control period, companies only need allowances for half of their 2022 emissions by midnight March 1, 2023. Then, by March 1, 2024, they will need allowances for all their 2023 emissions plus any remaining 2022 emissions.</p>

<p><strong>Power Plant Companies Have Many Options to Reduce Carbon Pollution</strong></p>

<p>While most companies that own power plants are expected to bid for the credits they need during the quarterly auctions, they have other options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A company could invest in process improvements or otherwise reduce the amount of fossil fuels they burn and the pollution they emit;</li>
	<li>Companies could invest in eligible CO2 emissions offset projects. Examples include verified projects that sequester carbon through reforestation initiatives, avoid emissions through improved forest management practices, or reduce pollution from other sources such as landfill gas or agricultural methane; </li>
	<li>Companies could participate in the &ldquo;secondary market&rdquo; where they can trade not only allowances with other companies, but also financial derivatives such as futures, forwards, and options; or</li>
	<li>Some companies may even be able to structure their operations to qualify for allowances from other set-aside programs like those for combined heat and power units.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Fight Over Pennsylvania and RGGI Isn&rsquo;t Over Yet</strong></p>

<p>Of course, many polluting companies prefer the status quo where they can dump their carbon emissions into the air for free. Their friends in the legislature did everything they could to stop the program from going forward. Having failed to secure the votes to overturn Governor Wolf&rsquo;s veto, opponents are turning to the courts. They are not only asking the Commonwealth Court to invalidate the program, they are also seeking an injunction to prevent the rule from going into effect while the Court decides.</p>

<p>Its too early to predict what the court might do, but PennFuture agrees with the DEP, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, and the Independent Regulatory Review Commission. All found that the CO2 Budget Trading Program is authorized by the Air Pollution Control Act. We&rsquo;ve also joined with other groups seeking the opportunity to speak for our membership and to make our case before the Court.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we believe this program is the right choice for Pennsylvania. We are facing a growing climate crisis. Ignoring our climate obligation is a recipe for failure. </p>

<p><strong>Rather than Fight, the Legislature Has An Opportunity to Be Part of the Solution</strong></p>

<p>Under the Air Pollution Control Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) can only spend auction proceeds on measures that reduce air pollution. This could include projects that address legacy pollution sources, investments in new clean energy, and many other needed programs. </p>

<p>If the Legislature were to approve a spending plan, the DEP could make even more targeted investments, bringing added benefits to frontline workers and impacted communities as well as our shared environment.</p>

<p>The RGGI Investments Act &mdash; SB15 (Comitta) in the Senate and HB 1565 (Herrin) in the House &mdash; proposes just that sort of program. The legislation would support workers and communities affected by the clean energy transition, investing specifically in frontline and environmental justice communities.</p>

<p><strong>Good Climate Policy in Pennsylvania Has Been a Long Time Coming</strong></p>

<p>Pennsylvania was once considered a leader in climate policy. In 2004, Pennsylvania passed the Alternative Energy Portfolio Act which required, for the first time, electricity distribution companies to supply a certain percentage of alternative energy, including wind and solar power. In 2008, Pennsylvania passed Act 129, which required electricity distribution companies to reduce energy consumption through investments in energy efficiency in their geographic regions. Again in 2008, the legislature enacted a grant and loan program through DEP and the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) to support the installation of renewable energy projects. </p>

<p>But over the ensuing 14 years, Pennsylvania not only failed to update any of its climate legislation or re-invest in its renewable energy programs, it has actively tried to stop any efforts to cut carbon emissions. Those policies have effectively died on the proverbial vine.</p>

<p>Instead, Pennsylvania has reverted to its historic roots as a fossil fuel zealot, showering the fracked gas industry with subsidies and weak regulations, ignoring the plight of communities beset by pollution or the Commonwealth&rsquo;s role as one of the major climate contributors in the United States.</p>

<p>This is what makes the RGGI rule so important. It&rsquo;s the first time in 14 years Pennsylvania has taken climate action. Certainly, the fight for the RGGI rule&rsquo;s long-term survival isn&rsquo;t over yet. The adherents to the philosophy of free pollution and an economy dominated by fossil fuels are still loud and active. But we hope that this is a turning point where we can put the doldrums of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s climate history behind us and begin building a clean, more prosperous future.</p>

PennFuture Celebrates Lake Erie and Introduces New Erie Campaign Manager During PA Clean Water Education Week,4/13/2022,"<p>PennFuture is celebrating its sixth annual PA Clean Water Education Week, dedicated to showcasing the Commonwealth&rsquo;s unique waterways and advocating for their health by ensuring sufficient state funding for protection and restoration initiatives. Throughout the week, we highlight each of PA&rsquo;s six major watersheds. Today we celebrate the Lake Erie Watershed!</p>

<p>There is much to appreciate about Lake Erie. The 11th largest lake in the world by surface area, Erie provides drinking water to over 11 million people basin-wide. Erie is the warmest and shallowest of the five Great Lakes and, subsequently, the most biologically productive and diverse. Lake Erie also presents a success story for clean water funding. Efforts of the 1970s, including the passage of the Clean Water Act and the multi-national <a href=""https://ijc.org/en/great-lakes-water-quality-agreement-turns-50#:~:text=There%20is%20much%20to%20reflect%20on%20as%20the,social%2C%20cultural%20and%20spiritual%20activities%20of%20Indigenous%20peoples."">Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement</a>, addressed unabated industrial pollution, agricultural runoff, and poor wastewater treatment that plagued Lake Erie. More recent funding from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative provided extra assistance for priority cleanup locations known as Areas of Concern, including Presque Isle Bay, which was deemed safe again and delisted in 2013. Consistent support from decisionmakers and dedicated clean water funding have allowed Lake Erie and Presque Isle Bay to become the thriving recreational, commercial, and cultural assets we know today.</p>

<p>In my first weeks with PennFuture in Erie, it became clear that many Erieites are proud of the improvements made to their lake and bay. However, we cannot take this progress for granted and must remain unified in our resolve for protection of these resources. Today, our lake faces complex challenges linked to climate change, surface runoff, invasive species, legacy and emergent industrial toxins, and pollution from the fossil fuel and plastics industries. Watershed residents in historically burdened communities, particularly communities of color, face compounding and disproportionate impacts from legacy contamination and other threats. For these reasons, we continue to advocate for the funding necessary to limit the impacts of our built and agricultural resources on water quality, to improve ecosystem and community resilience, and to foster an appreciation of these resources among all Pennsylvanians by ensuring everyone has access to outdoor amenities, including our lake.</p>

<p>Sufficient funding is essential for protecting Lake Erie and our watershed residents but is only one piece of a comprehensive approach requiring policy change and involvement from decision makers at all levels, businesses, academic institutions, and a diverse array of citizen advocates. I am thankful for the foundational work of our staff and community partners as outlined in <a href=""/Files/Admin/ErieCommonAgenda_6.pdf"">Our Water, Our Future: A Common Agenda for Protecting Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Lake Erie Watershed</a>. In collaboration with twelve area environmental organizations, several resident scientists, and a cohort of social justice reviewers, PennFuture outlined this comprehensive framework needed to address water quality concerns.</p>

<p>Clean water funding remains a priority for the state budget season, but we must advance other aspects of the Common Agenda. Stimulus funds under the American Rescue Plan and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Acts create opportunities to fund many of our budget recommendations. These relate to stormwater management, renewable energy and electric vehicle infrastructure, orphaned and abandoned oil / gas well plugging, brownfield reclamation, and other commercial and neighborhood development efforts. We will advocate for watershed communities getting their fair share of these funds and for the prioritization of water quality and environment concerns in project implementation.</p>

<p>Recognizing the disproportionate impact of environmental issues and the COVID-19 pandemic on disadvantaged communities and people of color, we seek to ensure stimulus investments and other decision-making processes equitably benefit all communities and promote inclusive decision-making. This includes ongoing involvement in <a href=""https://blavity.com/how-a-pennsylvania-towns-community-revitalization-project-is-hurting-its-low-income-poc?category1=opinion"">litigation with PennDOT</a> and the US Highway Administration regarding the Bayfront Parkway reconstruction plans that lacked of proper environmental consideration in project design phases and will harm environmental justice communities.</p>

<p>New and improved policy at local and state levels will be essential to placing Lake Erie Watershed communities on a sustainable, long-term trajectory, particularly once stimulus funds are spent. PennFuture and our partners continue to focus on landuse policies that benefit water quality and human health, and legislative safeguards against industrial, fossil fuel, and plastic pollution. With collaboration and shared goals, the Erie region can set itself on a new path, recognizing environmental and human health need not be framed in opposition to economic prosperity. I welcome the input of diverse partners across all sectors as we work toward this vision for our watershed communities.</p>

Chasing the Rainbow: Carbon Capture is Magic Thinking,4/13/2022,"<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of discussion and excitement <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/carbon-capture-climate-change-iowa-rcna19572"">about the idea of carbon capture and storage technology.</a> Unfortunately, the excitement about the potential far outstrips the reality of the technology.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that we are living <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/"">through climate change</a>. It isn&rsquo;t a question of whether it&rsquo;s coming, it&rsquo;s a question of&mdash;pardon the pun&mdash;degree. We all see and experience the changing weather patterns, the increasing storms. Our parents&rsquo; stories of skiing and sledding throughout the winter in Philadelphia when they were children is nearly unimaginable now. The future is uncertain and often scary. In these dramatic circumstances, it&rsquo;s natural for us to reach for hope and to reach for dramatic solutions.</p>

<p>Carbon capture, also known more formally as &ldquo;carbon capture utilization and storage&rdquo; (and it&rsquo;s accompanying acronym &ldquo;CCUS&rdquo;), looks on its surface like exactly the hero we need. The idea behind it is tantalizingly simple: develop technology and systems that takes the carbon we&rsquo;re putting into the air with fossil fuels and simply puts it back into the ground where it came from. In theory, there are different ways to do this, ranging from startups that could develop bold new technologies, to simply identifying and accelerating natural processes that already happen, like planting trees. Carbon capture holds universal appeal: environmentalists see it as a way to restore the planet to sustainable CO2 levels, fossil fuel proponents see it as a way to continue their business without major disruption, and even non-experts can get behind the idea of something that gives us the best of all worlds.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is all magical thinking. Magical thinking is dangerous, because it lets us avoid the real, immediate challenges we are facing in favor of a solution that may never materialize. As a global society, we absolutely need to develop new technologies to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, not only is carbon capture not a silver bullet, it is distracting us from the technology we already have.</p>

<p>We already have proven technology that is competitive on the free market: For instance, we know that solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources <a href=""https://ieefa.org/milestone-u-s-wind-power-second-highest-electrical-source-last-week/"">can work wonderfully</a> as part of a portfolio of energy sources. Battery technology has improved almost beyond imagination in a short time, with energy storage costs <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/"">declining 72% between 2015 and 2019</a>, and energy storage systems <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/"">increasing 27% from 2018 to 2019 alone</a>. These are real tools that we are already successfully using worldwide and that the USA is playing an important part in expanding.</p>

<p>By contrast, carbon capture is a technology that overpromises and underdelivers. Despite <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/carbon-capture-technology.html"">decades of development efforts</a>, carbon capture remains both extremely expensive, unproven to be able to work <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/2287551-inside-the-race-to-scale-up-co2-capture-technology-and-hit-net-zero/"">at the necessary scale</a>, and largely unable to meet its own projections of success. For one example, we could look at hydrogen as &ldquo;clean&rdquo; energy. What we really know is that hydrogen as a fuel source is really just a rebranding of an old frenemy, the oil and gas industry. So-called &ldquo;green&rdquo; or &ldquo;blue&rdquo; hydrogen is advertised as a new energy solution, better for the climate. In reality, the carbon capture systems at hydrogen plants have been shown to fall dramatically short, with terrible consequences. First of all, it&rsquo;s critical to know that hydrogen must have highly successful carbon capture&mdash;90% or more!&mdash;to be &ldquo;clean.&rdquo; However, <a href=""https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blue-Hydrogen-Presentation_February-2022.pdf"">recent studies</a> have found that hydrogen plants that utilize carbon capture only have a success rate ranging from 48% to 77%.</p>

<p>Even if (and it is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo;) carbon capture has a breakthrough, the better use for that technology would be to reduce our global carbon levels back down to more sustainable levels. The global temperature is rising: this technology should be used to mitigate the problems, not to try and put a band-aid over a bullet hole. But until that time, we have the ability to start work using the tools that are already at hand: strengthening our environmental protections, working with other states in the country and region to fundamentally reduce greenhouse gas release (such as through joining RGGI), and accelerating our use of renewable power.</p>

Pennsylvania House Asks: Could We Live Without Fossil Fuels? We Say: We Must.,3/31/2022,"<p>The only thing more destructive than the fumes from fossil fuels extracted in PA is the fumes of the trillions of taxpayer dollars up in flames by the constant shilling to fossil fuel boosters in the form of disinformation-laden hearings in our State Capitol.</p>

<p>On March 28, 2022, the Pennsylvania House Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committee held an industry-friendly hearing titled &ldquo;Could We Live Without Fossil Fuels?&rdquo; Phrases such as &ldquo;natural gas and oil are essential to life&rdquo; uttered by Rep. Mike Armanini and &ldquo;we cannot go back to living like the colonials and Native Americans&rdquo; stated by both Chairman Daryl Metcalfe and panelist David Taylor polluted the air of the meeting room. Metcalfe asks in the title of this hearing &ldquo;could we live without fossil fuels?&rdquo; and the answer is not &ldquo;we could,&rdquo; &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; or even &ldquo;we should;&rdquo; but instead: we must.</p>

<p>The panelists, which were all (and only) representatives of the fossil fuel industry including the American Petroleum lnstitute (API), Marcellus Shale Coalition, Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association (PIOGA), American Refining Group, and Pennsylvania Chemical lndustry Council. These panelists were aided throughout the hearing by the majority chairman and his caucus.</p>

<p>This hearing repeated tired, frequently-debunked talking points about the &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; of fossil fuel-based products in the American consumer&rsquo;s daily life. However, as Minority Chair Greg Vitali correctly pointed out, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/oil-companies-are-going-all-in-on-petrochemicals-and-green-chemistry-needs-help-to-compete-153598"">roughly 80 percentof each barrel of oil extracted</a> is used for gasoline or other fuel, while the rest goes to other petrochemical products such as those used in household items. Rep. Danielle Friel Otten and Rep. Joe Hohenstein also pushed back on the &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; of these products and assertions by the panelists that &ldquo;no viable alternative&rdquo; exists. With increased research and development, environmentally sustainable household products are increasing in availability and lowering in price. In regards to baby products, an area of much discussion at this hearing, there is no shortage of products that are <a href=""https://www.mother.ly/baby/baby-shopping-guide/eco-friendly-baby-care-items/"">both sustainable</a> and <a href=""https://www.poison.org/articles/dangerous-household-hydrocarbons"">actually safer</a> for mothers and their newborns than petrochemical based products.</p>

<p>Another heavy focus of the hearing was medical devices, and the current reliance on petrochemicals in their production. The panelists, aided by majority representatives, argued that &ldquo;viable alternatives&rdquo; do not exist to the current medical products. This is largely false, as <a href=""https://www.greenbook.org/mr/market-research-news/environmental-sustainability-healthcare-and-medical-devices/"">roadmaps and suggestions to manufacturing</a> more sustainable medical devices and products have existed for years.</p>

<p>However, what is lacking is larger-scale investment, development, and research which would lead to such products becoming less expensive and more widely available.</p>

<p>Rep. Bud Cook, a member of the majority, raised an interesting question &ndash; whether the panelists could speak to the perspectives of employees in the fossil fuel industry and how their work impacts the environment in which they live. Metcalfe quickly interrupted Cook, rephrasing the question to whether the panelists could speak to the &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; petrochemical based products used in fishing and outdoorsman equipment. PennFuture has long researched and written about the impacts of fossil fuel extraction on vulnerable, front-line communities including, but not limited to, rural and working-class populations largely served by members of the majority in Harrisburg.</p>

<p>In Rep. Cook&rsquo;s Washington and Fayette County constituencies, residents fall victim to <a href=""https://www.coalfieldjustice.org/blog/2019/8/5/statement-on-columbia-gas-explosion-in-washington-pa"">pipeline explosions</a>, <a href=""https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/thousands-gallons-gas-spill-into-washington-county-creek-neighbors-report-feeling-sick/DTFEFKNXANFGHLRPYUTYLG5C3M/"">gas leaks</a>, <a href=""https://www.alleghenyfront.org/cnx-pleads-to-criminal-charges-for-misreporting-air-pollution-in-washington-county/"">air pollution</a>, and <a href=""https://www.publicsource.org/rural-pennsylvanians-with-contaminated-water-potentially-from-fracking-feel-abandoned-by-state-regulators/"">water contamination</a> due to continued fossil fuel extraction. PennFuture also maintains the position that fossil fuels and petrochemicals are not the key to revitalizing regions that both Rep. Metcalfe and Rep. Cook serve. Alternative, <a href=""https://exclusive.multibriefs.com/content/green-collar-jobs-in-the-spotlight/facilities-grounds"">&ldquo;green-collar&rdquo; job opportunities</a> are growing worldwide and present <a href=""https://rmi.org/rmi-reality-check-appalachia-poised-to-become-clean-energy-country/"">enormous economic opportunities</a> for Appalachia, and instead of chasing a dying industry, Pennsylvania would be best served <a href=""/greenstimulus"">leading the path into the new, green economy.</a></p>

<p>This hearing, at its basis, presents a false dichotomy: invest in fossil fuels or live like those in the colonial era. As Minority Chair Vitali aptly noted, &ldquo;that is ridiculous.&rdquo; As for the remark about Native Americans made by Metcalfe and some in the panel, Rep. Hohenstein made a noteworthy retort. Hohenstein cited the <a href=""https://www.ictinc.ca/blog/seventh-generation-principle"">Seventh Generation Principle</a>, based on an ancient Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) philosophy. This Principle states that the decisions we make today should result in a sustainable world seven generations into the future.</p>

<p>While we seek cheap and quick solutions to our energy needs today, we are leaving a dead planet for our children tomorrow unless we make swift investments in the emerging green economy. As the representative from API said in this hearing: &ldquo;we all breathe the same air, we all drink the same water, and we want a clean environment&rdquo; &ndash; and it is time we put our money where our mouth is and act like we believe this while we still can.</p>

Philadelphia’s 2023 Budget Must Prioritize Clean Water for All,3/29/2022,"<p><a href=""https://c.tenor.com/QZNVDaVse9sAAAAC/looney-tunes-bugs-bunny.gif"">Duck season! Rabbit season!</a></p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s budget season!</p>

<p>We are only days away from Mayor Jim Kenney&rsquo;s penultimate budget address to City Council and the annual push to fund numerous priorities. The good news? Philadelphia continues to recover from the economic turmoil brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The bad news? Philadelphia <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-budget-pandemic-revenue-down-mayor-jim-kenney-20220215.html"">continues to lag behind other major cities</a> in America in its recovery from the pandemic.</p>

<p>In a January <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTd5wWNrAM8"">town hall</a>, Mayor Kenney said: &ldquo;The budget is not just about numbers and spending. It&rsquo;s the representation of the priorities of our city&hellip;The budget takes our values and turns them into investments. And, turns our hopes and goals into plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A video presentation went further: &ldquo;The budget represents the City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s commitment to tackling its biggest challenges, including providing a safe and just city, health equity for all, and quality education for all Philadelphians. Amid all the charts and numbers of the budget is a core goal: to increase equity and opportunity so that you can reach your full potential regardless of what corner of the city you live in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, what are our values for the 2023 fiscal year? A survey helps shed some light on the city&rsquo;s priorities and preferences. These were the options to choose from:</p>

<p>Anti-violence;<br />
Neighborhood Services;<br />
Education;<br />
Business and Workforce Development;<br />
Arts and Culture;<br />
Infrastructure (Roads and Bridges);<br />
Support for Vulnerable People;<br />
Public Health;<br />
Public Safety; and<br />
Other: ______.</p>

<p>Attendees were encouraged to choose three priorities and provide their priorities in the chat if they selected &ldquo;Other.&rdquo; Not surprisingly, education was the top priority among attendees, followed by neighborhood services.</p>

<p>At first glance, the list of potential options encapsulates many, if not most, of the broad categories that require further investment. But if we take another look, there are issues. The list above makes no mention of climate or the environment. In fact, climate was not mentioned once during the virtual town hall that spanned approximately sixty minutes. The environment was not mentioned either. Unfortunately, <a href=""https://www.thegreencities.com/news/mayor-kenney-leaves-out-climate-change-out-of-his-budget-address/"">we&rsquo;ve seen this movie before</a> in Philadelphia as issues related to climate change and the environment are set aside during one of the most crucial periods of the fiscal year.</p>

<p>To start, infrastructure isn&rsquo;t just roads and bridges &ndash; as one attendee astutely pointed out during the January town hall. In fact, Philadelphia <a href=""https://e360.yale.edu/features/with-a-green-makeover-philadelphia-tackles-its-stormwater-problem#:~:text=In%20a%20major%20initiative%2C%20Philadelphia,green%20America's%20fifth%2Dlargest%20city."">remains a leader</a> through its incorporation of green infrastructure like trees, rain gardens, and other natural elements to improve the local environment and increase public health.</p>

<p>We have also seen the annual reminder of the impact our aging water infrastructure can have on all of us <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/busted-water-mains-flood-philly-streets-as-city-fails-to-hit-pipe-replacement-goals/"">with another round of water main breaks</a> as the city&rsquo;s efforts to replace old pipes continue to fall short. As I&rsquo;ve written previously, <a href=""/Blog-Item-Its-Time-to-Reimagine-Americas-Infrastructure"">Philadelphias water pipes are ancient</a>. The average age is approximately 73 years, and more than 800 miles of the city&rsquo;s mains are older than 100 years.</p>

<p>Massive water main breaks can be devastating for any community, particularly underserved communities that cannot afford to shoulder the cost of repairs to their homes and neighborhoods that can stem from a massive water main break, <a href=""https://6abc.com/south-philadelphia-water-main-break-queen-village-july-2021-6th-and-bainbridge/11658288/"">nor bear the delays</a> in restoring basic services to the impacted area. Part of Kingsessing <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/water-main-break-west-philly-kingsessing-56th-and-springfield-avenue-20220209.html"">recently experienced</a> a 48-inch break to a water main that was 100 years old. The main broke in early February and neighbors <a href=""https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/one-month-after-massive-water-main-break-residents-still-feeling-impact/3171770/"">are still suffering from the effects</a> more than a month later. One family said that it took several weeks to restore heat to their home, forcing family members to use a space heater to provide some warmth during cold winter months.</p>

<p>Councilmember Jamie Gauthier represents the neighborhood and <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/water-main-break-kingsessing-heat-electricity-20220218.html"">summed up the situation</a> in a written statement: &ldquo;Our most vulnerable residents should not have to shoulder the burden of the long-term failure of all levels of government to adequately fund the maintenance of Philadelphia&rsquo;s water infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mayor Kenney&rsquo;s budget address and the subsequent hearings in City Council present an opportunity for the city to clarify how it will do its part to properly fund efforts to update its creaking, groaning water infrastructure. PennFuture will be listening for spending proposals that will capitalize on the important work of the city&rsquo;s Green City, Clean Waters plan to utilize green stormwater infrastructure and green space to relieve some of the pressure on the city&rsquo;s water mains. We are also very interested to hear from the city how it plans to take advantage of new funding sources provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to help it fund this critical work and avoid millions of dollars in damages to communities that can least afford it.</p>

<p>Green City, Clean Waters has also provided opportunities for the city to create opportunities for workforce development through organizations like <a href=""https://powercorpsphl.org/"">PowerCorpsPHL</a>. Founded in 2013, PowerCorpsPHL <a href=""https://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/powercorpsphl-philadelphia/"">has helped hundreds of young people</a> gain access to career opportunities that were not previously available to them. Participants can earn an hourly wage while developing skills in areas that will help them succeed in the jobs of tomorrow through rebuilding and protecting our natural infrastructure. Green City, Clean Waters allows participants to receive training in the installation, repair, and maintenance of green stormwater infrastructure, which remains an industry <a href=""/Blog-Item-Report-highlights-success-of-Philadelphias-Green-City-Clean-Waters-Program"">with enormous growth potential</a> and economic benefit across Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, PowerCorpsPHL has seen its city funding <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-gun-violence-programs-funding-20211227.html"">cut severely over the past several years</a> despite its strong record of providing employment opportunities to disconnected youth, reducing violence, and improving Philadelphia&rsquo;s natural environment. In fact, the city has cut its funding to PowerCorpsPHL from almost $1.5 million per year to less than $400,000 since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>PowerCorpsPHL remains a national model that reminds us of what is possible when we prioritize workforce development and training in 21st-century career paths with efforts to improve the urban environment. Prior to the pandemic, the program <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/power-corps-mural-arts-guild-philadelphia-youth-gun-violence-20201202.html"">was able to secure family-sustaining jobs</a> for 90 percent of its participants. It also provided an opportunity for youth and returning citizens to chart a path for themselves that would be free of the immediate threat of crime and violence.</p>

<p>The city recognized the program&rsquo;s success in helping to combat the rising tide of violence in Philadelphia when it awarded PowerCorpsPHL with a $550,000 grant because of last year&rsquo;s budget negotiations. This, however, must be used for the specific grant proposal and will not help sustain the program in doing the work that it has done so successfully since its inception. The city should use this budget season as an opportunity to restore its funding to PowerCorpsPHL to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>It is a clich&eacute;, but budgets are about our values. PennFuture&rsquo;s values during this budget season are simple:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Protect our most vulnerable neighborhoods from the impact of warmer, wetter weather, and an aging infrastructure through sustained investment in green infrastructure and green space;</li>
	<li>Ensure that the least fortunate among us do not have to bear the burden of preventable disasters like water main breaks; and</li>
	<li>Provide access to job opportunities for disconnected youth and returning citizens so that they can have access to careers that will provide for themselves and their families.</li>
</ol>

<p>We hope that Mayor Kenney&rsquo;s budget address and the subsequent City Council hearings will reaffirm the city&rsquo;s commitment to these values and demonstrate the city&rsquo;s ability to put its money where its mouth is.</p>

"PennFuture, Partners Halt Construction of Proposed Liquefied Natural Gas Plant in Bradford County",3/28/2022,"<p>PennFuture, representing our partners Clean Air Council and Sierra Club, secured a big legal victory on March 18 by obtaining a settlement that halts the construction of a proposed Bradford County Real Estate Partners (&ldquo;BCREP&rdquo;) Liquified Natural Gas (&ldquo;LNG&rdquo;) facility near the Susquehanna River in Wyalusing Township, Bradford County, in Northeastern Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In August, PennFuture and our partners appealed a second extension of the air pollution permit for the proposed facility issued by the Department of Environmental Protection (&ldquo;DEP&rdquo;) to the Environmental Hearing Board (&ldquo;EHB&rdquo;).In this challenge, we objected to the second extension on several grounds, including that DEP erred in granting the extension because BCREP had not commenced construction at the Wyalusing facility, as required by the regulations.Further, the second extension relied on outdated and inappropriate pollution control technology.We also objected to the second extension because the DEP relied on flawed analysis resulting in insufficient and erroneous air emission limits, and several other significant deficiencies as detailed in our <a href=""/Files/Admin/2021-8-26-Notice-of-Appeal-without-exhibits.pdf"">Notice of Appeal,</a> which may be found here.</p>

<p>The parties agreed that BCREP will not move forward with construction of the facility under its current air pollution permit and will allow the permit to expire on July 22, 2022.In return, PennFuture and our partners ended our appeal of the second extension of the air pollution permit.If BCREP wants to build this facility, the settlement requires them to go through the process of applying for and obtaining an entirely new air pollution permit from DEP.</p>

<p>The proposed Wyalusing facility would have processed fracked natural gas into highly explosive LNG for shipment by truck or train through Pennsylvania communities to a proposed LNG export facility in Gibbstown, New Jersey for transport to overseas markets. This proposed LNG export scheme would endanger the health of our communities and environment, increase fracking in Pennsylvania, and lead to the further entrenchment of the fossil fuel industry.If constructed under the current air permit, the Wyalusing facility would have been permitted to emit over a million tons of greenhouse gasses and hundreds of tons of other harmful air pollutants annually, contributing to both climate change and dangerous air pollution.To learn more about LNG and its dangers, please check out our LNG Blog Series: <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-Series-1-What-is-Liquefied-Natural-Gas"">LNG Blog #1</a>, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-2-Bomb-Trains-Through-Pennsylvania"">LNG Blog #2</a>, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-3-Protect-Northern-PA"">LNG Blog #3</a>, <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-4-Liquified-Natural-Gas-Should-Not-Become-the-New-Bomb-Trains-to-Threaten-Our-Communities"">LNG Blog #4</a>, and <a href=""/Blog-Item-LNG-in-PA-Blog-5-Public-opposition-grows-to-proposed-LNG-shipping-terminals"">LNG Blog #5.</a></p>

"Fallacy, Fiction, and Falsehoods: Debunking the Fossil Fuel Industry’s Stance on Russia’s War in Ukraine",3/25/2022,"<p>On Feb. 24, Russia commenced its unprovoked and atrocious invasion of its neighbor Ukraine. It didn&rsquo;t take long for fossil fuel interests in the United States to exploit this geopolitical and humanitarian crisis for their own benefit, using the war to call for increased fracking, fast-tracked permitting, new subsidies, and relaxed environmental regulations here in America.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the industry didn&rsquo;t stop there. Nearly every day, there arenews articles, social media content and opinion pieces from industry boosters who spread false narratives, myths and other fallacies, all in an effort to further pad the pockets of corporate polluters.</p>

<p>This is a running list of some of the most egregious bad-faith arguments being put forth by the fossil fuel industry and their legislative champions in media outlets, accompanied by fact-checking of those arguments.

<p><u><strong>Myth</strong></u>: In a recent Op Ed piece, state Sen. Camera Bartolotta made <a href=""https://observer-reporter.com/opinion/op-eds/op-ed-time-to-wake-up-to-consequences-of-energy-reliance/article_1133b352-9e2e-11ec-b123-1b698af81a81.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=user-share"">many false and disingenuous statements</a> about Pennsylvania&rsquo;s role in combating Russian aggression. Notably, Bartolotta said Gov. Tom Wolf &ldquo;banned natural gas development in the eastern third of the state&rdquo; and &ldquo;banned development of the state&rsquo;s own natural gas rights underlying publicly owned property.&rdquo; Finally, the state senator bluntly said &ldquo;the U.S. needs Putin&rsquo;s oil.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> There is a lot to unpack here. First, the Delaware River Basin Commission - which is composed of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and a representative from the federal government - <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2021/02/25/delaware-river-basin-commission-votes-to-ban-fracking-in-the-watershed/"">voted to ban fracking</a> in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion of the basin last year. Gov. Wolf is but one of many voting members of the DRBC, and did not act unilaterally when the agency banned fracking in the basin.</p>

<p>Secondly, Gov. Wolfdid not ban fracked gas development on public lands in Pennsylvania. He <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2015/01/29/gov-wolf-bans-new-drilling-in-state-parks-and-forests/"">placed a moratorium on new drilling</a>, which is a huge difference. Prior to that moratorium, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Conservation and Natural Resources leased more than 250,000 acres of state forest lands in the Marcellus play, 65% of which hasn&rsquo;t been drilled (163,089 acres). The problem isnt availability of locations, it&rsquo;s the economics. The companies drill only when it makes economic sense, which it currently does not. Saying that Gov. Wolf &ldquo;banned&rdquo; drilling on our public lands is an outright lie.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the United States does not need Russian oil, as evidenced by President Biden&rsquo;s ban on Russian imports. Even before that ban, <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/explainer-happen-us-banned-russian-oil-83314181"">roughly 8% of U.S. imports of oil and petroleum products</a> came from Russia - a modest amount by any measure.</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> Europe, which is directly threatened by Putin&rsquo;s turn to war, has already come to the conclusion that an economy tethered to fossil fuels is highly unpredictable, costly, and dangerous&mdash;particularly when we factor in the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/climate/climate-change-ipcc-report.html"">impacts of climate change.</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Europe is clamoring for our energy exports. Germany recently announced it is <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/germany-aims-get-100-energy-renewable-sources-by-2035-2022-02-28/"">accelerating its timeline to achieve 100 percent renewable energy</a>. The European Union is <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/02/23/russia-ukraine-eu-nordstream-strategy-energy/"">readying an initiative</a> to fast-track renewable energy projects and cut the continents use of fossil fuels in half in eight years. And most EU countries are ahead of schedule in their renewable energy goals and are not slowing down. Clearly, fracked gas is not the answer.</p>

<hr />
<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> In a March 8th <a href=""https://triblive.com/opinion/sen-gene-yaw-american-energy-key-to-undermining-putins-war/"">editorial in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a>, Pennsylvania state Sen.Gene Yaw said that &ldquo;renewable energy accounts for less than one third of global energy supply and remains notoriously unreliable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> This is wrong on two counts. First, renewable energy &ndash; which encompasses a huge range of sources, including wind, solar, and hydroelectric &ndash; is in fact equally reliable to other energy sources. No kind of power plant <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/rachel-fakhry/myth-247365-power-plant"">runs 24/7, 365 days a year</a>, and operating America&rsquo;s electric grid always involves managing variability of supply and demand at all times.</p>

<p>Second, it&rsquo;s contradictory for Yaw to claim renewables are unreliable when he&rsquo;s talking about a fossil fuel supply that has proven to be - you guessed it - highly unreliable when it&rsquo;s controlled by a despot like Vladimir Putin. Fossil fuels have always been controlled by whichever country or political entity sits atop them, which leads to a great deal of volatility and weaponization of these products. Nobody owns the sun and wind. They cannot be manipulated or controlled for political or other gain.</p>

<hr />
<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> In a letter <a href=""https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/6902686E-7AEC-47F8-8C38-5010A3A352D4"">sent to President Biden on March 2</a>, the Senate Natural Resources Committee claimed that President Biden is responsible for soaring gas prices because of his hostile attitude toward the oil and gas industry, including a moratorium on drilling on public lands.</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> President Biden is <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/01/27/oil-gas-leasing-biden-climate/"">currently outpacing</a> his predecessor when it comes to issuing drilling permits on public lands. According to <a href=""https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/new-data-biden-slays-trumps-first-year-drilling-permitting-by-34-2022-01-21/#:~:text=New%20Data%3A%20Biden's%20First%20Year,34%25%20%2D%20Center%20for%20Biological%20Diversity&amp;text=WASHINGTON%E2%80%94%20New%20federal%20data%20shows,first%2Dyear%20total%20of%202%2C658."">the Center for Biological Diversity</a>: &ldquo;the Biden administration approved 3,557 permits for oil and gas drilling on public lands in its first year, far outpacing the Trump administration&rsquo;s first-year total of 2,658.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not to mention that oil and gas companies <a href=""https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/oil-gas-industry-stockpiled-drilling-leases-before-biden-pause"">have thousands of leases on public lands</a> that are unused and inactive, which has nothing to do with President Biden, and everything to do with energy companies&rsquo; own business choices.</p>

<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> In a recent Op Ed piece, U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis alleged that scaling up domestic oil and gas is <a href=""https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/596804-the-real-way-to-support-ukraine-is-to-flip-the-switch"">as easy as &ldquo;flipping the switch.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> Domestic crude oil production in the U.S. is at <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS1&amp;f=A"">historically high levels</a> with 2019, 2020, and 2021 exceeding production in all other years.Production of natural gas in 2021 also reached an <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_prod_sum_a_EPG0_FGW_mmcf_a.htm"">all-time high</a> both nationally and in Pennsylvania.Even if companies had the ability and desire to increase production<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/energy/us-oil-production/index.html"">it could take years before we see significant changes.</a> That&rsquo;s not likely given the fact investors <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2021/03/06/973649045/hold-that-drill-why-wall-street-wants-energy-companies-to-pump-less-oil-not-more"">are hesitant to pour more money</a> into companies that have underperformed in recent years.</p>

<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> Industry boosters are claiming that Pennsylvania is in a position to increase LNG production and exports to Europe, and say that <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/fracking-is-a-powerful-weapon-against-russia/2022/02/24/8bd49c56-95b5-11ec-bb31-74fc06c0a3a5_story.html"">&ldquo;fracking may be America&rsquo;s most powerful weapon against Russian aggression.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> Liquified Natural Gasexports reached peak levels in 2021 at just over 3.5 trillion cubic feet.Many European nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Netherlands, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, Lithuania, and Poland imported record high levels of American LNG. Because our infrastructure is already operating near capacity, meeting the demand in Europe required diverting production that would normally be sold into Asian markets. At this point, increasing exports to Europe will require major investments in infrastructure on both sides of the Atlantic.Accomplishing this will take years and cost, potentially, billions of dollars. Furthermore, this assumes that Europe is looking to buy, but in fact, they are responding to this crisis <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-28/germany-brings-forward-goal-of-100-renewable-energy-to-2035"">by accelerating their plans to move to renewable energy.</a></p>

Seth Grove <a href=""http://www.repgrove.com/News/26413/Latest-News/Grove-Calls-for-Increased-Distribution-of-Pennsylvania-Natural-Gas-to-Reduce-Reliance-on-Russia-"">has suggested that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s participation</a> in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is somehow connected to or impacted by Russia&rsquo;s war and oil and gas exports.</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u>Under the RGGI program, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s electric generators burning fossil fuels will pay market-based emission fees for each ton of carbon pollution they emit.The proceeds from this program will be invested in cost-effective programs to reduce energy consumption and air pollution.The net result will be to help diversify our generation mix and lower both our dependence on fossil fuels and our exposure to a fossil fuel market Putin and others can manipulate. Simply put, RGGI has absolutely nothing to do with Russia or its oil and gas exports.</p>

<p><u><strong>Myth:</strong></u> In <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/climate/climate-oil-crisis-global.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytclimate"">a March 10 article in the New York Times</a>, a fossil fuel executiveacknowledges &ldquo;the need to tackle climate change,&rdquo; but said &ldquo;that effort should take a back seat to the more urgent need to increase fossil fuel production.&rdquo;</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u><strong></strong>Action on climate change has been taking a back seat for decades, and this current moment is definitely not the time to backslide any further. The science backs up that claim:many of the impacts of global warming are now simply &quot;irreversible,&quot; <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60525591"">according to the UNs latest assessment</a>, and humans and nature are being pushed beyond their abilities to adapt. It&rsquo;s already well past time for humanity to break its addiction to fossil fuels, and the industry will always be looking for ways to stay relevant in a world that is increasingly climate-conscious.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><u>Myth:</u></strong>Weakening environmental protections will allow us to increase production and become independent of foreign oil.</p>

<p><u><strong>Fact:</strong></u> The US is already operating very near its all-time peak level of crude oil production, with over <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrfpus1&amp;f=a"">4 billion barrels produced last year</a>.In spite of this near-record production, the US still imported more than 3 billion barrels of oil in 2021 with more than <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbbl_a.htm"">245 million barrels coming from Russia.</a></p>

<p>Pennsylvania is also operating near its peak levels of oil production, but that represents a fraction of a percent of the national total <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrfppa1&amp;f=a"">with less than 7 million barrels produced in 2021</a>. The true path to energy independence lies in strengthening and securing our grid and reducing reliance on oil in the first place, not in rolling back the environmental protections that let us breathe, drink clean water, and enjoy the natural resources of our incredible state and country.</p>

"This year, Pennsylvania must properly fund efforts to clean up our waterways",3/22/2022,"<p>On Feb. 8, Gov. Tom Wolf delivered his eighth and final budget address in which he spelled out the top priorities and programs that need to be funded in the coming fiscal year. The speech marks the official kickoff of a budget process that will culminate with a new state spending plan by the end of June.</p>

<p>It is absolutely imperative that this new budget includes the necessary funding needed to get Pennsylvania closer to our clean water goals, both here at home and in the Chesapeake Bay. Wolf&rsquo;s speech, after all, came only a few weeks after a new report that shows at least one-third of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways are so impaired and polluted that they are unsafe for wildlife, recreation and drinking water. Locally, over half of York County&rsquo;s waterways are impaired.</p>

<p>Simply put, our dirty water problem is getting worse in Pennsylvania, not better, and elected officials in Harrisburg have shown little appetite to properly fund the programs and initiatives that are needed to clean our waterways.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t continue to lose ground in the ongoing fight for clean water. That&rsquo;s why PennFuture <a href=""https://pennfuture.salsalabs.org/cleanwaterpetition/index.html?fbclid=IwAR33vmbJNrwO1i8CZYpdfHb-Lulev3e4IZ0NqCCwe4VqZivpwk84-AJxi5g"">started a new petition calling on our elected officials to take seriously</a> their duty and responsibility to bring about clean water, both for current and future generations of Pennsylvanians. The time is now for lawmakers to hear our concerns and to finally understand that properly funding clean water initiatives isn&rsquo;t just the right thing to do, it&rsquo;s the smart thing to do right now and for the future.</p>

<p>We all benefit from clean water in our waterways. The issue of polluted water in Pennsylvania is significant. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s insurmountable.</p>

<p>In 2010, Pennsylvania, along with five other states and the District of Columbia, voluntarily entered an agreement to clean up local waters and the Chesapeake Bay by the end of 2025. This commitment was reaffirmed in 2014 when the parties signed another agreement upholding their intent to meet the goals on time.</p>

<p>What does that mean for Pennsylvania? In the Susquehanna and Potomac River watersheds alone, which account for roughly half of the state, the funding gap to clean up our polluted creeks and rivers will cost additional $325 million annually from what is already being spent.</p>

<p>Excess nutrients and sediment pollute our streams here in Pennsylvania and ultimately flow down to the Chesapeake Bay where they have a detrimental impact on aquatic life, including oysters and blue crabs. In Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion of the watershed, 15,000 miles of streams are polluted. In York County, there are 868 miles of polluted streams, roughly the same number of miles it would take to reach Daytona Beach, Florida. Key sources of this water pollution are runoff coming from farms, cities, and towns.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has a long way to go to meet its goals. Since entering this agreement, the state has severely lagged behind in making progress, so much so that two lawsuits were filed in 2020 against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s failures, including one by the states of Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>There is hope. The state just released an updated plan on how it will meet its goals by 2025. Almost every county in the watershed has a plan developed locally by community leaders and members. There are thirty County Action Plans that identify what needs to be done and the resources needed to accomplish the local goals. The estimated annual cost in York County is $26 million.Its now up to the General Assembly to do their part. Despite forward momentum to improve local waterways, time and time again our legislators fail to fully invest in our water resources.</p>

<p>This year our elected officials are out of excuses to kick the can further down the road. The state&rsquo;s coffers are projected to have over $1.6 billion in surplus plus a large infusion of billions of dollars from the federal government through the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, both passed last year by Congress.</p>

<p>The clock is ticking. There are less than four years remaining for Pennsylvania to meet its goals. In a recent letter to Pennsylvania, the EPA was clear that it is willing to take action if the state does not meet the federal government and increase funding.</p>

<p>We know that Pennsylvanians value their constitutional right to clean water and a healthy environment. Poll after poll demonstrates wide, bipartisan support for increases in state investments for clean water.</p>

<p>Our elected officials need to hear from you. That is why we are calling on Pennsylvanians to show lawmakers you care about clean water funding.</p>

"Russia-Ukraine Crisis: War, Fossil Fuels, and What it Means for Pennsylvanians",3/1/2022,"<p>Russia&rsquo;s war with Ukraine is underlining the economic and national security costs of relying on fossil fuels. Global reliance on limited, place-based fossil fuel resources, such as Russia&rsquo;s gas reserves, has become a tool of authoritarian leaders, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, to exert their global influence, regardless of its human and economic costs. How the world&mdash;including states like Pennsylvania&mdash;reacts to this global security crisis may dictate our energy future for years to come.</p>

<p>Russia bases its leverage on the world stage on its fossil fuel production and Western reliance on their supply, and is using this leverage to engage in military operations in Ukraine. The European Union <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy/bloc-2c.html"">relies on Russia for around 40 percent</a> of its fossil fuel supply. Global recourse against Russian aggression in Ukraine, such as military action or economic sanctions, could result in immediate energy consequences in Europe, potentially by Russia limiting supply, as well as global implications because fossil fuel prices will be (and already are) skyrocketing.</p>

<p>The sanctions recently announced by President Biden and other world leaders will begin testing Russia&rsquo;s fossil fuel leverage over the world. For its part, the United States has temporarily worked behind the scenes to ameliorate these energy concerns in the short-term by working with partner countries to increase liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to the European Union. In fact, the United States is now the largest exporter of LNG to the European Union. As a result, Germany, Russia&rsquo;s largest trading partner in Europe, was comfortable <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/22/germany-halts-certification-of-nord-stream-2-amid-russia-ukraine-crisis.html"">halting operation of the massive Nord Stream 2 fracked gas pipeline project</a>, an $11 billion pipeline designed to double the amount of gas flowing from Russia to Germany. However, as Russia&rsquo;s war with Ukraine continues, prices will continue to rise worldwide and our energy security problems will only deepen.</p>

<p>In response to Russia&rsquo;s war and western economic sanctions, what happens next will be telling. Russia may respond to harsher sanctions by suspending sales of fracked gas to the West. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/business/oil-markets-prices.html"">Outside of Europe</a>, Russia produces 10 percent of the world&rsquo;s supply, and 3 percent of the US&rsquo;s daily consumption of fracked gas. U.S. consumers have already begun feeling the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with nationwide gas prices <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/business/oil-markets-prices.html"">rising 20 cents on average</a> in the last month alone. <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2022/02/18/Pittsburgh-gasoline-price-rise-Russia-Ukraine-international-oil-markets-risk-premium-natural-gas/stories/202202170126"">In Pennsylvania</a>, as well, consumers have been facing rising prices due in part to the crisis.</p>

<p>We are also starting to see the fossil fuel industry <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/business/economy/russia-ukraine-energy-security-climate-change.html"">try and take advantage</a> of this global crisis. Gene Barr, President of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce, is calling for <a href=""https://triblive.com/opinion/gene-barr-its-time-us-energy-policy-stops-empowering-russia/"">state and federal policy changes</a> to allow for building more pipelines and export facilities&mdash;going so far as calling out advocates as well as environmental and safety regulations as being the equivalent of &ldquo;enriching Russia.&rdquo; Three Pennsylvania State Senators <a href=""https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2022/02/24/pennsylvania-lawmakers-urge-restart-construction-keystone-xl-pipeline/"">are advancing a resolution</a> calling on President Biden to restart the Keystone XL Pipeline&mdash;a pipeline that was canceled in 2020, which would have increased the capacity of transporting tar sands crude oil from Alberta, Canada, into the United States. And State Representative Seth Grove <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&amp;SPick=20210&amp;cosponId=36931"">is proposing</a> the End Russian Aggression Act to de-regulate fracking, expedite pipeline permits, provide new subsidies for pipeline construction, and end Pennsylvania&rsquo;s alignment with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, the recent completion of the Mariner East 2 pipeline to the Marcus Hook refinery and export facilities is now poised to increase LNG exports to Europe from the frack fields in Pennsylvania, creating an opportunity for the fossil fuel industry to argue for state policies that allow for more drilling with efforts to counter Russian aggressions.</p>

<p>The United States&mdash;and Pennsylvania&mdash;has a long-term choice to make. We could follow the playbook of the fracked gas industry, Rep. Grove, and other policymakers and drill, baby, drill to potentially send more LNG to market for overseas export (not for national markets) and raise energy prices further because of increased competition abroad. Or it could chart another path that doesn&rsquo;t rely on drilling, pipelines, and the whims of global energy markets by pushing for renewable energy sources.</p>

<p>The pro-climate change policies enacted at the state and federal level in recent months cannot be thrown off-course by fracking enthusiasts that are singularly driven by their profit margin. We certainly believe doubling down on the long-term reliance on fossil fuels in Pennsylvania in reaction to a global energy crisis caused by the Russian government cannot be further from the solution or the truth. Our energy policies must continue to have long-term, future generations in mind.</p>

<p>Furthermore, reliance on fossil fuels is not energy independence. In fact, we&rsquo;re not the only ones that think so&mdash;the European Union is paving a far different path forward than drill, baby, drill <a href=""https://www.eenews.net/articles/will-russia-spur-or-deter-europes-shift-to-green-energy/"">by hitting the gas pedal</a> on renewable energy.</p>

<p>The crisis in Ukraine has forced Germany, and the European Union as a whole, to reevaluate their complex relationship with the Kremlin and the dirty energy the EU consumes from them. The EU <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/02/23/russia-ukraine-eu-nordstream-strategy-energy/"">plans to unveil an initiative</a> in the next week that would fast-track the permitting process for renewable energy projects. European policymakers acknowledge they would be in a better spot if they had started more concerted work on building robust energy independence years ago, but they say that in some ways skeptics have needed this crisis to be kicked into action. In December, Germany approved $68 billion to accelerate its climate and green infrastructure spending.</p>

<p>It is past time that the United States, and our Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, <a href=""/Blog-Item-Its-Past-Time-for-Pennsylvania-to-Invest-in-Renewable-Energy"">embraces a renewable energy future</a>. A renewable energy future, in addition to being great for American workers, jobs, and our climate, would prove to be a better investment of America&rsquo;s resources and national security and serve as a robust alternative to further reliance on authoritarian dirty energy.</p>

<p>The world looks different today to many&mdash;the post-World War II global alignment is threatening to be shattered by Russia&rsquo;s aggressions in Ukraine. But for many still, the world has also looked different because of the global insecurity and economic threat that is climate change. An energy crisis caused by Russian military action and weaponizing fracking is not an anomalous event&mdash;it&rsquo;s the latest in a constant drumbeat of natural disasters, fossil fuel infrastructure crises, and geopolitical threats sparked by a reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The United States&mdash;and Pennsylvanians&mdash;have a choice: continue the energy policies of fossil fuels&mdash; those causing public health and natural disasters&mdash;or charter a renewable energy path that breaks us from this cycle once and for all.</p>

<p>The chorus of voices from the fossil fuel industry will only grow louder in the coming weeks, all seeking the same handouts and weakened regulations. We should reject this chorus and not double down on the policies that have exacerbated this crisis in the first place. Europe is publically wishing it moved faster toward renewables. We shouldn&rsquo;t make the same mistake.</p>

Philadelphia Will Not Meet Climate Goals Without a Reconstituted Philadelphia Gas Works,2/23/2022,"<p>The future of energy in Philadelphia took center stage in mid-February during Philadelphia City Council&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLkEy4H-msY"">joint committee hearing on the Philadelphia Gas Works (PGW)</a> Business Diversification Study. Members of the Committees on Finance and Transportation and Public Utilities heard from city administration officials, PGW President and Chief Executive Officer Seth Shapiro, and advocates and stakeholders <a href=""https://www.phila.gov/media/20211207134817/PGW-Business-Diversification-Study-2021-12.pdf"">on the recommendations contained in the study</a> and how best to transition PGW away from its reliance on fracked gas.</p>

<p>Released in December 2021, the Diversification Study makes clear PGW&rsquo;s position as a gas utility and its desire to remain a gas utility. PGW has maintained that it believes gas will continue to play a central role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Philadelphia, as it did throughout the past two years while the study was ongoing. In fact, a straight line can be drawn from PGW&rsquo;s 2019 testimony during <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rgxvRKWbMk"">an earlier City Council hearing on this topic</a> to much of the findings and recommendations in the Diversification Study.</p>

<p>The study&rsquo;s third recommendation calls for a local decarbonized gas program where PGW partners with other City departments to convert waste into biomethane or renewable natural gas (RNG). Despite <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjbwwv/big-oil-has-a-plan-to-turn-appalachia-into-hydrogen-country"">big oil&rsquo;s big efforts</a> to ensure that RNG becomes the latest great hope to reduce carbon emissions while simultaneously continuing to promote an economy of extraction, <a href=""/Blog-Item-Renewable-Natural-Gas-Hope-or-Hype"">the future of RNG is more complicated</a>. As the study makes clear, RNG cannot play a significant role in reducing emissions in Philadelphia because it is more expensive to produce, does not contribute to air quality improvements, and it is limited in terms of commercialization or total availability. This recommendation should be shelved as RNG will not provide substantial aid in Philadelphia&rsquo;s climate pledges.</p>

<p>The study&rsquo;s second recommendation surrounding the use of geothermal energy carries the most promise. PennFuture strongly supports the pursuit of networked geothermal district systems to fully transition PGW from fracked gas. The conversation surrounding a potential geothermal energy future provided some of the most illuminating testimony during the joint hearing and could represent Philadelphia&rsquo;s best chance to significantly reduce PGW&rsquo;s emissions, provide protection for ratepayers from increasing costs as more households move away from fracked gas, and provide opportunities to PGW&rsquo;s workforce to maintain similar positions and even expand into new areas. But, we must move forward with all possible speed to complete any feasibility study and identify opportunities to quickly implement a pilot program.</p>

<p>Philadelphia will not achieve its climate pledges without a reimagined and reconstituted PGW. The joint hearing <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/kywnewsradio/news/local/philadelphia-gas-works-zero-carbon-goal-city-council"">further revealed PGW&rsquo;s ongoing reluctance</a> to do more than pay lip service <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/city-council-hears-options-for-decarbonizing-philadelphia-gas-works-divergent-visions-of-the-future-emerge/"">to this important conversation</a> while continuing to rely on oil and gas industry talking points. While PGW CEO Seth Shapiro does deserve some credit for stating his support for the idea of geothermal heat, this encouraging moment does not outweigh the balance of his testimony regarding the Diversification Study and PGW&rsquo;s role in supporting gas preemption legislation in Harrisburg.</p>

<p>Here are two points worth focusing on from Shapiro&rsquo;s testimony:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shapiro stated that it is irrefutable &ldquo;that natural gas is perhaps the most significant tool in greenhouse gas reductions.&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/30/18643819/climate-change-natural-gas-middle-ground"">Wrong.</a> In fact, this statement is directly contradicted by the Diversification Study, which says: &ldquo;Reaching the City&rsquo;s climate goals requires Philadelphia homes and commercial buildings to transition from natural gas to alternative sources of heating.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Shapiro pointed out that Pennsylvania currently produces a large portion of its electricity (40 percent) from fracked gas. While this may be accurate, it ignores <a href=""/Files/Admin/PF_FossilFuel_Report_final_2.12.21.pdf"">the various ways that fracked gas is subsidized</a> in Pennsylvania and how far public officials are willing to go to further deepen our reliance on fossil fuels like fracked gas.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Pennsylvania General Assembly has consistently sought to change the rules of the free-market economy to advance the interests of the oil and gas industry. The joint committee hearing <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/emails-about-pgws-role-in-energy-choice-bill-pit-councilmember-gym-against-utilitys-ceo/"">raised the latest method that lawmakers are seeking</a> to advance in Harrisburg: gas preemption <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=275"">through Senate Bill 275</a> and <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1947"">House Bill 1947</a>. These bills would ban municipalities across Pennsylvania from restricting or prohibiting utility services based on the types of energy they provide. It is being <a href=""https://www.vox.com/22691755/gas-utilities-fight-electrification-preemption"">pushed nationally by oil and gas industry groups</a> like the American Gas Association, which includes PGW as a member.</p>

<p>Why would state legislation be raised in a local government hearing on a seemingly unrelated topic? Because PGW <a href=""https://whyy.org/articles/pgw-emails-show-involvement-in-drafting-bill-that-runs-counter-to-climate-goals/"">has worked to support and strengthen</a> this dangerous legislation. Shapiro raised several points under questioning from Councilmember Helen Gym that require attention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shapiro stated that PGW is very concerned with the &ldquo;catastrophic impact of limiting energy choice.&rdquo; To be clear, this legislation only seeks to limit real energy choice by changing the rules of the game to counter market forces that are seen as a threat to the fossil fuel industry.</li>
	<li>He maintained that PGW is neutral on the bill. It is not. Former PGW executive Gregory Stunder provided substantive feedback on the bill and provided additional language to strengthen definitions contained in the bill.</li>
	<li>He denied that PGW provided line edits to the legislation. <a href=""https://media4.giphy.com/media/UVkisudp4aRFWA2ReE/giphy.gif?cid=790b76114a6e02f7bea9bd155ef54c827aa4694292bf08fc&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g"">It did.</a></li>
	<li>He repeated several times that PGW staff are subject matter experts and are obligated to provide feedback on legislation. This is nothing more than an attempt to ignore the real issue at hand: PGW contradicted the city&rsquo;s own stance on this legislation and worked to undermine the city&rsquo;s ability to achieve its climate pledges.</li>
</ul>

<p>As Councilmember Gym pointed out to Shapiro, definitions matter. The feedback matters. Shapiro mentioned several times throughout this testimony that we must look at facts and repercussions even though he used half-truths, obfuscations, and fossil fuel industry falsehoods in his defense of PGW&rsquo;s involvement with gas preemption legislation and its defense of the continued reliance on fracked gas.</p>

<p>There is good news, though! Gas preemption legislation recently hit a roadblock in the General Assembly despite the best efforts of organizations like the American Gas Association.</p>

<p>The state House of Representatives passed HB 1947 but was not able to garner enough support to override a veto from Governor Tom Wolf. This was a critical vote because it demonstrated that oil and gas champions within the General Assembly will likely be unable to pass this unnecessary legislation through regular order.</p>

<p>This would not have been possible without the hard work and advocacy from those who took time to reach out to their state legislators and voice their opposition to gas preemption and the disastrous consequences it will have on Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>There is more work to do, though, as the General Assembly will likely continue to seek out potential avenues to enact this legislation. As we saw most recently <a href=""/Blog-Item-The-Plastics-Problem-More-False-Strategies-Statewide-Preemption"">with preemption efforts</a> to prevent municipalities from banning single-use plastic bags, gas preemption legislation could make its way into a fiscal code bill during state budget negotiations. Our work continues to ensure that this legislation is not enacted because those who support the legislation remain determined.</p>

<p>The oil and gas industry will continue to use all the power at its disposal to delay or deny Pennsylvanians the opportunity to have energy that is both clean and affordable. Fossil fuel insiders will continue to argue that they can drill and refine our way out of the worst impacts from man-made climate change, but natural disasters generated <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2022/01/10/us-natural-disasters-cost-145-billion-in-2021---3rd-costliest-year-on-record/?sh=288bcb5d4606"">approximately $145 billion in economic damage</a> throughout the United States in 2021. Pennsylvania suffered effects from the costliest natural disaster: Hurricane Ida.</p>

<p>We are consistently confronted <a href=""https://www.vox.com/22912760/natural-gas-methane-rename"">with the language of denial</a>, deflection, and delay. There is time to act, but we must do so with speed and clarity. It will require the kind of innovation that so many called for during the joint hearing on the Diversification Study. Continued reliance on fracked gas &ndash; or its derivatives &ndash; will not help us.</p>

<p>We cannot afford to continue operating as usual as the toll from climate change grows ever higher. These are the facts and the repercussions, and we must face them.</p>

"During Black History Month, State Legislators Fighting Against Jim Crow 2.0 in Pennsylvania",2/15/2022,"<p>A generation ago my mother was born in &ldquo;Jim Crow-era&rdquo; North Carolina. A generation before that, my grandmother was prohibited from voting before the Voting Rights Acts was enacted. So, I grew up understanding that the right to vote is at the very foundation of our national identity, and that voting is both a right and a responsibility.</p>

<p>Now decades later &ndash; after the abolition of the poll tax, the end of lawful segregation, and the passage of landmark Civil Rights legislation &ndash; here we are: 2022 in Pennsylvania and that fundamental right that I had grown to respect and celebrate is still under attack.</p>

<p>Of course, poll watchers don&rsquo;t administer literacy tests or collect poll taxes, but new obstacles have emerged with a singular goal: voter suppression. Some hope that by making voting so onerous people will be discouraged from participating at all.</p>

<p><strong><u>Turning Back the Clock</u></strong></p>

<p>Pennsylvania had made significant gains in expanding access to free and fair elections in 2019 when Act 77 garnered bipartisan support and allowed no excuse mail-in voting. The timing was fortuitous because months later a worldwide pandemic struck that continues to impact Pennsylvanians&rsquo; daily lives. But because of Act 77, we could vote safely in the elections of 2020 and 2021. In fact, in the 2020 General Election, about 2.6 million Pennsylvanians used this safe and secure option to exercise their right. </p>

<p>However, following the historic election of President Biden and Vice President Harris in 2020, the same lawmakers in the majority who approved of Act 77 in October 2019 sued to have it overturned, including mail-in voting. Why? Mail-in ballots were used more heavily by Democrats than Republicans. Lawmakers in the majority quickly concluded that curtailing access to mail-in voting was an easy way to stifle the vote in communities of color across Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>A judge on the Commonwealth Court recently handed down a decision that Act 77 is unconstitutional, however mail-in voting remains in effect while the matter is on appeal in the state Supreme Court.</p>

<p>This retreat from Act 77 is not an isolated incident, it is one example in a concerted effort to disrupt Pennsylvania&rsquo;s free, fair, and accessible elections and undermine the will of the voters. Other tactics include sowing doubt in the integrity of our elections, proposing new election reforms to erect barriers to voting (specifically in urban areas), advancing plans to permanently gerrymander Pennsylvania&rsquo;s congressional districts, and weakening our state&rsquo;s system of checks and balances.</p>

<p>The House Democratic Caucus has been fighting these efforts every step of the way and have made <a href=""https://pahouse.com/policycommittee/defendingdemocracy"">Defending Democracy</a> a key tenet of our policy platform. We won&rsquo;t give up. Our democracy and the right to vote are too important. And we continue to make progress.</p>

<p><u><strong>One person, one vote</strong></u></p>

<p>Last year, as part of legislative redistricting, the Commonwealth took an important step in reversing the inequities of prison gerrymandering, which is the practice of counting people who are incarcerated as residents in the location of their correctional facility, not their home of record. The practice diluted the power of the vote for Black and Brown communities whose citizens are disproportionately incarcerated, while inflating the weight of a vote cast in districts hosting prisons.</p>

<p>Treating people as permanent residents of their incarcerated location instead of their home community makes no sense, especially because those eligible to vote while incarcerated are required to register to vote and vote at their residence prior to confinement.</p>

<p>This is not a progressive or conservative issue. It is about fairness and &ldquo;one person, one vote.&rdquo; While prison gerrymandering reform was scaled back to only include people whose sentences expire before April 1, 2030 (the next Census) it is a step in toward improved equity in our elections, and as a result, more than 30,000 people &ndash; about half of a legislative district &ndash; will now be counted in their home community, not where they are temporarily housed.</p>

<p>Also, while we work to defeat bad policy ideas that would hinder voting and undermine democracy, we&rsquo;ve introduced our own plan - <a href=""https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=2090"">The K. Leroy Irvis Voting Rights Protection Act</a> - to ease burdens on voting, bolster election security, and strengthen our democracy.</p>

<p>First, it would make voting easier by permitting early voting, providing for more ballot drop boxes, and allowing same day registration, each of which has been adopted in other states. Next, the bill would make updates requested by our county election officials, like 21 days of pre-canvassing (where election officials can prepare mail-in and absentee ballots prior to Election Day). Finally, it would support election security by implementing statewide electronic poll books for secure real-time monitoring of election rolls, a practice currently used by nearly three dozen states.</p>

<p>It is not the time to roll back the improvements we made to our election laws during the pandemic. We should be promoting options for safe and secure voting and celebrating people exercising their right. We need to be restoring faith in our election system and our local election officials, not sowing doubt in its results.</p>

<p>We need to fight for our fragile democracy and renew our commitment to ensuring that every voice be heard.</p>

Updated Integrated Water Quality Report Reveals 33 Percent of Pennsylvania Waterways are Polluted,2/10/2022,"<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is inviting public comment on the most-recent Draft Integrated Water Quality Report (IWQR). As more waterways are evaluated, the report reveals that the state of our water resources is increasingly bleak.</p>

<p>In accordance with the federal Clean Water Act, every two years, DEP updates the IWQR with the latest data on water quality from across the state. Between 2020 and 2022, the condition of 13 percent of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s 86,600 miles of streams were assessed, bringing the total number of surveyed waterways to 99 percent and 97 percent of public lakes.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/CleanWater/WaterQuality/IntegratedWatersReport/Pages/2022-Integrated-Water-Quality-Report.aspx"">draft 2022 IWQR finds</a> 33 percent of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s stream miles are impaired. That&rsquo;s a step backward from 30 percent in the 2020 IWQR. A body of water is considered &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; if monitoring data show the stream, river or lake fails to meet one or more water quality standards.</p>

<p>If a stream or lake is determined to be impaired, in most cases, the DEP is required by the federal Clean Water Act to establish clean up plans, known as a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for pollutants that a body of water can receive while still meeting water quality standards.</p>

<p>Across the state, the top three sources of water pollution remain the same: acid mine drainage from abandoned coal mines, agriculture, and stormwater runoff from developed areas. Based on this report&rsquo;s newly assessed streams, acid mine drainage has replaced agriculture as the dominant source of pollution.</p>

<p>The health of our rivers, streams, and lakes are assessed for four different categories of use: aquatic life, recreation, fish consumption, and public drinking water supply. Looking at all these uses, the IWQR shows that Pennsylvania is a state of water quality extremes.</p>

<p>Southeast Pennsylvania has some of the highest percentage of polluted waterways. Nearly all the streams in Philadelphia and Delaware counties are impaired at 97 and 94 percent, respectively. These streams are highly modified and impacted by stormwater pollution, industrial waste, and combined sewer overflows. Montgomery, Chester, and Bucks counties make the top 10 list for percent impaired. To the southwest, Allegheny county, home to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s second largest city, has similar water quality impacts, and is not far behind with over 69 percent of streams impaired, or 915 stream miles.</p>

<p>Counties with the largest number of miles impaired contend with entirely different sources of pollution. Lancaster County has the most miles of impairment at 1,438 stream miles, or 89 percent, largely from widespread agricultural runoff. While in Elk County, the IWQR counts 1,126 miles of impaired streams (68 percent), caused largely by acid mine drainage, reaching the second highest number of impaired miles in a county.</p>

<p>A portion of northwest Pennsylvania is part of the Lake Erie Watershed with three other states and Canada. In Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portion, nearly half (48%) of all stream miles are impaired, largely impacted by a mixture of both urban and agricultural runoff. Lake Erie itself remains impaired for recreation and fish consumption. More specifically, the fish consumption advisory in place for Presque Isle Bay is due to industrial polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) pollution.</p>

<p>However, not all of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways suffer from pollution. In fact, some of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s <a href=""https://ourpoconowaters.wordpress.com/"">most-pristine waterways</a> are found in the Poconos. In Wayne, Monroe and Pike counties, out of 3,642 total stream miles, only 815 miles are considered impaired (22 percent).</p>

<p>But, it&rsquo;s the home county of Elk State Forest that wins the ultimate water quality prize. Cameron County has 21 miles of impaired streams (3 percent), the smallest concentration in the state.</p>

<p>The IWQR contains some good news. Since 2004, about 920 miles of streams and 28,000 acres of public lakes have been effectively restored, showing that progress is possible. Since 2020 alone, 120 stream miles were found to be no longer impaired by pollution.</p>

Pipeline Problems Persist in Pennsylvania,2/7/2022,"<p>The fracked gas industry in Pennsylvania will never stop trying to convince us that pipelines are safe, efficient and necessary. Just look at <a href=""https://marcelluscoalition.org/2021/09/27/msc-responds-to-penneast-pipeline-cancellation/"">a press release that the Marcellus Shale Coalition released</a> in September, in which the group called pipelines &ldquo;the safest way&rdquo; to transport fracked gas, and that attempts to block pipelines &ldquo;will harm local, regional and national environmental progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They must not be living in current-day Pennsylvania, because even a cursory glimpse at local and regional news headlines tells a much different story about pipelines.</p>

<p>PennFuture and other environmental advocacy groups <a href=""/Blog-Item-DEP-Should-Revoke-Permits-for-Troubled-Mariner-East-Pipeline"">have been vocal</a> about the doomed Mariner East 2 pipeline owned by Energy Transfer Partners, which has been plagued by dozens of spills, sinkholes and other accidents <a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2021/12/06/mariner-east-builder-sunoco-agrees-to-4m-settlement-over-marsh-creek-lake-spill/"">that have destroyed our environment and natural resources.</a></p>

<p>To date, that pipeline project has been:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/mariner-east-pipeline-pennsylvania-crimial-charges-spills-20211005.html"">Hit with 48 criminal charges</a> from Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Attorney General related to repeated environmental damages from construction of this pipeline.</li>
	<li><a href=""https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/state-charges-mariner-east-ii-gas-pipeline-owner-with-48-environmental-crimes/"">Hit with more than $20 million in fines</a> and penalties from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, including a $12.6 million fine in 2018 that was one of the largest ever imposed by the state DEP.</li>
	<li><a href=""https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/mariner-east-2/"">Hit with more than 120 violations</a> of state law for polluting wetlands, waterways, and destroying about a dozen private water wells.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that PennFuture has joined with several Pennsylvania lawmakers in <a href=""https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/berks/3-lawmakers-call-for-dep-to-halt-mariner-east-2-permits/article_924f1f78-3770-11ec-bad0-6790e8142049.html"">calling for the permits for this project to be revoked</a>. There are literally more than 100 examples of how this project is a <a href=""https://patch.com/pennsylvania/westchester/mariner-east-pipeline-called-nuisance-chesco-d-s-lawsuit"">public nuisance</a>, and Energy Transfer has shown us - time and again - that it lacks the ability to operate within the bounds of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s laws.</p>

<p>It is offensive and perplexing that this project has been allowed to proceed. But what&rsquo;s even more offensive is that 48 criminal charges apparently aren&rsquo;t enough for Energy Transfer to get its act together.</p>

<p>On the other side of Pennsylvania, in Beaver County,Energy Transfer built the Revolution Pipeline, a 40-mile line that transports fracked gas between two processing plants. You might remember this pipeline as the one that exploded in 2018, causing a massive fireball that burned down a family&rsquo;s home, in addition to a barn and several cars, and caused widespread destruction of a nearby forested area.</p>

<p>When it was announced this week that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Attorney General filed an additional <a href=""https://www.timesonline.com/story/news/2022/02/02/energy-transfer-criminally-charged-revolution-pipeline-explosion/6637877001/"">9 criminal charges against Energy Transfer</a> in relation to the Revolution Pipeline explosion, the company responded that it was <a href=""https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2022/02/02/Energy-Transfer-grand-jury-environmental-crimes-Revolution-natural-gas-pipeline-explosion-Beaver-County-2018/stories/202202020133"">&ldquo;no surprise to us.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Sadly, it was no surprise to us either. It was no surprise when the DEP hit Energy Transfer with another $30 million fine related to Revolution, and it is no surprise that this company has been allowed to put the Revolution Pipeline back in service despite hundreds of violations from the state.</p>

<p>When is enough enough? Has this company not shown us that it cannot operate safely in Pennsylvania? Will state regulators finally get the message after the next pipeline explosion, sinkhole or spill? When will the DEP step up and take seriously its duty to protect our environmental rights?</p>

<p>So remember: next time groups like the Marcellus Shale Coalition tell you pipelines are safe and necessary, don&rsquo;t believe them. The evidence is right in front of us to the contrary.</p>

Terrible Excuses to Mine Bitcoin,1/25/2022,"<p>A person using the pen name &ldquo;Satoshi Nakamoto&rdquo; <a href=""https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"">released a paper in</a><a href=""http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"">2008</a>introducing Bitcoin in an attempt to solve a problem with internet commerce: trusted third-parties needed to mediate online transactions resulted in increased costs and eliminated the anonymity buyers have when using cash.In Satoshi&rsquo;s plan, we could avoid these problems by replacing trusted third parties with cryptographic security&mdash;basically just math.</p>

<p>What Satoshi envisioned was more than just Bitcoin.He proposed a way to make a shared online ledger where anyone can record data like financial transactions in a way that can&rsquo;t be edited after the fact. This is known as a &ldquo;Blockchain&rdquo; and bitcoin are the reward for creating a new block in the chain.</p>

<p>While Satoshi&rsquo;s math works, and the invention has potential uses, there is an underlying flaw.The &ldquo;proof of work&rdquo; mechanism that controls how and when new blocks are added to the blockchain is very energy intensive and wasteful by design.Currently, the network <a href=""https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index"">uses over 15 gigawatts of energy</a>&mdash;in other words, the network as a whole consumes more energy than the average Pennsylvania household uses in 40 years for each Bitcoin it creates.With most of that energy coming from polluting fossil fuels, that results in an enormous amount of pollution including climate destroying greenhouse gases.It doesnt need to be this way&mdash;Satoshi picked one way of regulating how Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain operates, but there are alternatives that can do everything that Bitcoin can do without being nearly as energy intensive.</p>

<p>Moving to a more efficient &ldquo;coin&rdquo; than bitcoin will be challenging. As the first cryptocurrency to be introduced, it has inertia in the market that will be challenging to overcome.The system also has powerful supporters among people who sell energy&mdash;particularly the fossil fuel industry&mdash;who like the idea of a new industry that heavily relies on their product.</p>

<p>On January 20, 2022 the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on <a href=""https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-cleaning-up-cryptocurrency-the-energy-impacts-of-blockchains"">&ldquo;Cleaning up Cryptocurrency: the Energy Impacts of Blockchain.&rdquo;</a>While the Committee and the panel of speakers made some good points and accurate observations, the hearing also provided a platform for several pro-bitcoin boosters to repeat really bad arguments in favor of wasteful crypto-mining. Below is a quick review of some of the bad arguments the committee didn&rsquo;t challenge:</p>

<p><u>I&rsquo;d gladly pay you Tuesday for a Hamburger Today</u></p>

<p>Polluting industries often claim they use fracked gas now, but sometime later they will voluntarily switch to hydrogen, install carbon capture, or otherwise stop polluting.Bitcoin is no exception with claims that it will eventually clean itself up. Even if that happens (and there is no guarantee it will) energy will still be wasted.If we adopt a cleaner alternative to Bitcoin instead, we can still get all the benefits of blockchain technology while we use the clean energy for other priorities or reduce consumer prices because supply exceeds demand.</p>

<p><u>Wasting energy is good for [reasons]</u></p>

<p>A recent claim noted that using fracked gas for mining Bitcoin is a &ldquo;better&rdquo; choice than flaring it, but that is a strawman argument.An even better choice is investing in energy efficiency and clean renewable generation so we don&rsquo;t have to frack the gas in the first place.Even if one concedes some fracking is inevitable, the flaring might not be.More stringent regulations of fracked gas emissions and leakage can often solve the flaring problem.</p>

<p>A similar spin on this argument is to say that mining Bitcoin could &ldquo;absorb wasted clean energy.&rdquo;It is true that some areas with very high levels of clean generation have seen days with so much generation that electric prices go negative and people are literally paid to take it.Getting paid to use energy would be a good deal, but Bitcoin miners aren&rsquo;t going to spend huge amounts of money on mining hardware with a useful life measured in months and then sit idly by waiting for such an opportunity.</p>

<p><u>Look! A Squirrel!</u></p>

<p>Bitcoin miners will rely on distraction tactics such as redefining &ldquo;value&rdquo; to claim Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t actually wasteful after all.For example, some have claimed that because they use Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are heavily optimized for their job, they can crunch numbers much more efficiently than the more general-purpose machines that fill the average corporate data center.</p>

<p>An ASIC may be the most efficient way to do one particular calculation 100 trillion times every second, just like using a single enormous mining truck may be the best way to move 400 tons of dirt around a mine.But, if you can accomplish the same job without moving 400 tons of dirt, you can&rsquo;t really call the giant truck an efficient choice.Similarly, if you don&rsquo;t really need to do 100 trillion calculations per second, being able to do that better than anyone else is pointless.</p>

<p>Another distraction tactic relies on redefining pollution. In this case, a company PR department will promote the fact that they are complying with required environmental permits, or have installed emissions control systems, thereby implying that they aren&rsquo;t polluting.It should be obvious that doing the minimum required by law to reduce pollution isn&rsquo;t the same as being clean&mdash;cars have emissions controls too, but we know not to run the engine in a closed garage.</p>

<p><u>Greed is Good</u></p>

<p>Another way of redefining value is to argue that miners are not being wasteful if they are producing something people are willing to pay for.</p>

<p>There is undoubtedly a lot of money invested in Bitcoin. At the time of this writing, the Market Cap of Bitcoin was over $700 billion.Compared to corporations, that is only exceeded byApple, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Tesla, and Meta (Facebook).Is Bitcoin really worth $700 billion, or is it a giant speculative bubble&mdash;the modern version of the seventeenth-century <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania"">dutch tulip mania?</a></p>

<p>Famous value investor Warren Buffet, who&rsquo;s own company Berkshire Hathaway falls just below Bitcoin on the Market Cap list, once said &ldquo;If you buy something like Bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you dont have anything that is producing anything. You&rsquo;re just hoping the next guy pays more. And you only feel youll find the next guy to pay more if he thinks hes going to find someone thats going to pay more.&quot; Buffet&rsquo;s vice chairman Charlie Munger was more concise and compared Bitcoin <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bitcoin-is-rat-poison-berkshires-charlie-munger-says"">to &ldquo;rat poison.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Blockchain technology has some interesting use cases, but there are thousands of chains to choose from ranging <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2019/01/what-is-a-corporate-blockchain/"">from serious corporate platforms</a> to <a href=""https://dogechain.info/"">jokes that took on a life of their own</a>.Bitcoin may use a blockchain, but it&rsquo;s not the only game in town, and countless other blockchains that can do everything Bitcoin&rsquo;s can do if not more. Except for name recognition, it&rsquo;s hard to see any value unique to Bitcoin nevermind anything worth $700 billion.</p>

<p>Even if Bitcoin could justify its market capitalization, using that as the measure of its value is deeply problematic.Mining Bitcoin is causing pollution that harms public health and exacerbates the climate crisis. Not counting the negatives when you talk about value only gives you half the picture.</p>

<p><u>So, where do we go from here?</u></p>

<p>The first step should be to end subsidies for bitcoin mining that come out of the pockets of Pennsylvania ratepayers and taxpayers. This is the easiest and most common sense solution to tackle this issue.</p>

<p>Second, we need to educate policymakers and investors about the energy and environmental impacts of bitcoin. Hearings like the one held recently in Washington, D.C., are a good first step, but we need much more than that, both federally and here in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Then, finally, we need to move away from &ldquo;proof of work&rdquo; cryptocurrencies that are wasteful by design. Bitcoin relies on solving a difficult and energy-intensive math problem to create a new block in the chain, but that isn&rsquo;t necessary and isn&rsquo;t compatible with environmental and climate goals.</p>

<p>Simply put, bitcoin mining has proven to be wasteful and dirty, and that likely won&rsquo;t change any time soon.

Introducing PennFuture's New Legal Interns!,1/24/2022,"<p>Since its inception in 1998, PennFuture has emphasized the importance of using the law to protect Pennsylvania&rsquo;s environment and &ldquo;create a just future where nature, communities, and the economy thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, we have achieved significant legal and policy victories that reduce pollution and protect the environment. We have provided millions of dollars in pro bono legal services while setting critical precedents and enforcing environmental laws across the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>But as PennFuture looks forward to the next 20 years, we recognized that we need to be more involved with cultivating the legal talent that will continue to support our mission. Our attorneys have a long history of mentoring legal interns, externs, and fellows, and we wanted to create a more formal program to inspire the next generation.</p>

<p>With the generous support of the George and Miriam Martin Foundation and the Otto Haas Charitable Trust, PennFuture created a paid legal internship program to inspire and mentor law students interested in making a difference for our environment.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of this program is to provide the organization a cadre of young legal minds interested in taking on the myriad challenges impacting the State as well as to further their potential careers in environmental law. We also hope that providing for a funded internship will help to bring more diversity and inclusivity into the non-profit environmental advocacy sphere.</p>

<p>This spring semester, we have a fantastic group of law students for our internship, representing a range of backgrounds and experiences. We&rsquo;ve asked our new legal interns to explain, in their own words, what environmental law and PennFuture&rsquo;s mission means to them:</p>

<p><u><strong>Cassidy Mason is a third-year law student at Widener Commonwealth School of Law</strong></u></p>

<p>My environmental law career began to sprout during my undergraduate studies. I graduated magna cum laude from West Chester University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Political<img  class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/cassidy.PNG"" style=""width: 150px; height: 150px; float: right;"" /> Science and a minor in Law and Government studies in 2019. I was the founder of Undivided, a diversity club on campus. I also was a founding sister of Theta Omicron chapter of Kappa Delta, amember of pre-law society, and an honors college graduate. I have had the honor of earning a Green Dot certification in 2017 and I am also a proud recipient of the Nobel Peace Leadership Series of 2018.</p>

<p>While in my undergrad career, I worked as an intern for Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania. It was in this experience that I learned it is very important to elect those who are champions for our environment. While in this position, I helped create environmental-friendly political campaigns and agendas. I also canvassed many areas across multiple counties in Pennsylvania to bring awareness to voters about current environmental and social issues.<br />
<br />
Prior to joining PennFuture, I took a seminar course on environmental sustainability at Widener Commonwealth School of Law. It was in this course that I realized I too wanted to become a champion for our environment. I am particularly interested in climate change, air quality issues, and the protection of humans and animals on this planet. I am very excited to be interning with PennFuture this spring and I look forward to helping to create a legal space that puts our environment first.</p>

<p><u><strong>Sean Peterson is a third-year law student at Widener Commonwealth School of Law</strong></u></p>

<p>I have had a long standing interest in the environment and renewable energies since I was in high school where I actually started in the STEM field. For my senior project I studied the process of<img  class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/sean.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 150px; float: right;"" /> thermochemical biomass gasification (creating a renewable combustible fuel from compost or other carbon based garbage/waste) and built a gasification chamber. This led me to pursue an Electrical Engineering major for my first year of undergraduate studies. It was not until my freshman year at Montana State University that I discovered I wanted to attack the environmental issue from the law and policy side of things. At that point I switched my major from Electrical Engineering to Political Science and Economics and held a strong focus in my classes on natural resources and environmental issues.</p>

<p>After graduation from Montana State I came to Harrisburg, PA to work towards my law degree at Widener Commonwealth School of Law. I hope to graduate in May being only the second person to get all three governmental law certifications (as they are now), which include Administrative, Legislative and Environmental certificates. I hope to do so with honors in all three certificates. Additionally, I am an Honorable Patrick J. Murphy Fellow through the Law and Government Institute and am the president of the Law and Government Student Society on campus. In pursuit of the environmental law certificate in particular I have taken courses in sustainability and municipal law in order to give me a good background on what it takes to work in the field of environmentalism on the local level. The sustainability course specifically had me writing an ordinance from scratch for the Pennsylvania State Association of Boroughs on the incentivization of microgrids throughout Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>I have always known that environmentalism is the cause I wanted to fight for and I am so excited to be able to work for an organization like PennFuture. I can&rsquo;t wait to be able to soak up all the knowledge and experience they have to share with me!</p>

<p><u><strong>Rachel White is a third-year law student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law</strong></u></p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Religious Studies. This May, I will be graduating from Pitt Law with a concentration in Environmental and Energy Law. At Pitt,<img  class=""align-right"" src=""/Files/Admin/rachel.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 150px; float: right;"" /> Ihave worked with the Environmental Law Clinic for two semesters to help groups and individuals that could not otherwise afford legal representation with environmental issues in Western Pennsylvania. Additionally, I am the Treasurer for Pittsburgh&rsquo;s Legal Income Sharing Foundation, which aims to spread public interest awareness throughout the school and to give students scholarships to pursue public interest internships.</p>

<p>Prior to joining PennFuture, I interned with the U.S. Army JAG Corps at Fort Drum and Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services, a nonprofit environmental law firm. Additionally, I externed with the U.S. Department of the Interior, Solicitor&rsquo;s Office in Pittsburgh for two semesters. I also was a research assistant where I examined the regulatory scheme of Pakistan&rsquo;s circular economy. My experiences since coming to law school have cemented my desire to advocate for our environment. I am particularly interested in access to clean water and protection of wildlife, and am thrilled to be interning with PennFuture this semester!</p>

PennFuture Asks PA Supreme Court to Protect Pennsylvanians’ Groundwater and Environmental Rights,1/19/2022,"<p>In 1736, Benjamin Franklin coined the phrase: &ldquo;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&rdquo; This proverb remains as true today as it did in the earliest days of the Commonwealth, and is a foundational idea to the state constitution&rsquo;s Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA): The Commonwealth, and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), must look ahead into the future when it comes to environmental impacts, and consider what the outcome of something is going to be down the line.</p>

<p>This was the critical idea in the amicus&mdash;or &ldquo;friend of the court&rdquo;&mdash;brief that PennFuture, with several key allies, <a href=""https://johndernbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-1-13-FILED-Amicus-Curiae-Brief-78-MAP-2021.pdf"">filed before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on January 14, 2022</a>. PennFuture argued that the state&rsquo;s ERA requires the DEP to consider the environmental impacts of its decisions and the permits it grants ahead of time, and not just rubber stamp projects and hope they will get cleaned up later. It is common sense that sometimes the best way to fix a mess is to never create it in the first place, and that is especially true for environmental problems. Taxpayer dollars, environmental impact, human and environmental health, and the potential for unforeseen consequences matter. Unfortunately, the DEP did not think about these things, so PennFuture wrote a brief explaining to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court why it should have.</p>

<p>In this case, which kicked off in 2003, the company Gibraltar Rock had proposed to locate a rock quarry in the township of New Hanover in Montgomery County. The problem is that the quarry is right next door to a hazardous site that has contaminated the local groundwater with a number of compounds that are dangerous to people and the environment alike.</p>

<p>In 2005, the DEP issued a mining permit to Gibraltar Rock. The DEP, it should be said, has a program separate from the mining program that is specifically for the cleanup of contaminated sites like the one in New Hanover. That program already was well aware of the state of the hazardous site and the contaminated groundwater in New Hanover.</p>

<p>One might assume that the DEP would coordinate these programs, since it oversees both. One would be wrong.</p>

<p>In fact, when local citizen groups and the township ultimately appealed the permit to the Environmental Hearing Board (EHB), the EHB found that the DEP&rsquo;s supposed coordination over the years was &ldquo;essentially meaningless,&rdquo; and that the DEP had simply &ldquo;failed to give the matter any serious thought.&rdquo; After a hearing that lasted for four days, the EHB found that quarry mining would not only be likely to make groundwater contamination worse, but it would create new contamination of previously clean water! In the end, the EHB found that the DEP did not do its job on several fronts. First, it did not make sure that the quarry met the most basic requirements of the mining law. Second, the DEP did not do its constitutional duty to consider what would happen to the environment if the quarry opened.</p>

<p>The quarry appealed, and the case next went to the Commonwealth Court. The Commonwealth Court chose to ignore the detailed, 84-page facts and analysis of the EHB. Instead, in a surprise twist, the Commonwealth Court wrote that the quarry company had agreed to clean up the groundwater&mdash;which was incorrect&mdash;and then overturned the EHB opinion. The case is now at the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</p>

<p>PennFuture and our allies wrote a &ldquo;friend of the court&rdquo; brief to ensure that the Supreme Court understands what is at stake here. The Commonwealth Court opinion is contrary to years of Supreme Court precedent, and if it stands, could lead to a huge rollback of environmental protection. We argued three main points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>That the DEP has a duty under the ERA to consider in advance the environmental impacts of its decisions, even when they are impacts involving another DEP program;</li>
	<li>The EHB properly decided the DEP failed to comply with its ERA duty to consider groundwater pollution impacts from the nearby contaminated site, and;</li>
	<li>That the Commonwealth Court&rsquo;s opinion on the ERA issue is inconsistent with the Supreme Court&rsquo;s prior ERA decisions and unsupported by the record.</li>
</ul>

<p>The brief was filed on behalf of Professor John Dernbach of the Environmental Law and Sustainability Center at Widener University Commonwealth Law School, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, Green Amendments for the Generations, and the Clean Air Council.</p>

<p>The case is Gibraltar Rock, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, which has two docket numbers; there is an identical brief filed in each. We will be sure to keep you in the loop as soon as there is new information pertaining to this case.</p>

"New Amendment to Pennsylvania’s Watershed Implementation Plan Shows Progress in Meeting Clean Water Goals, but Legislature Still Must Act",1/12/2022,"<p>Last week, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) released its long-anticipated amendment to the <a href=""https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/ChesapeakeBayOffice/WIPIII/FinalPlan/PA_Phase_3_WIP_Final.pdf"">Phase 3 Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP).</a></p>

<p>This amendment further demonstrates the urgent need for the legislature to do its part and fund our clean water efforts. As PennFuture <a href=""/Blog-Item-Stakeholders-Making-Progress-on-Chesapeake-Bay-Goals-but-Legislature-Still-Lagging"">has written in the past</a>, the amendment shows that DEP and the counties within the watershed have stepped up to the plate and taken action, leaving the legislature responsible for holding back the state&rsquo;s progress.</p>

<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-review-amended-pennsylvania-plan-help-restore-chesapeake-bay-local-waters"">press release acknowledges</a> as much and says the agency is considering tough action if the amended plan fails to meet its goals or provide confidence that the state will meet its goals. The agency also stated that further actions, such as greater federal oversight of permits or increased inspections and enforcement actions, could occur.</p>

<p>EPA&rsquo;s press release calls out a recent letter it sent to Pennsylvania that specifically points to legislative actions that must occur for the state to meet clean water goals, like a dedicated state agriculture cost share program or requirements for stream buffers or fencing to keep animals from accessing streams.</p>

<p>This amendment is the latest in a series of efforts to reach clean water goals here at home, but also in the Chesapeake Bay. To better understand this issue, we first must dive into the history behind these efforts to connect the dots to where we are now.</p>

<p><u>The Problem</u></p>

<p>The Susquehanna River provides half of all the freshwater that flows into the Chesapeake Bay, and there are more than 15,000 miles of polluted streams within Pennsylvania&rsquo;s portions of the Susquehanna and Potomac River Basins alone. Simply put, that means that Pennsylvania plays a big role in combating pollution in the Chesapeake Bay solely because of the amount of pollution we send into the Bay.</p>

<p>Both water quality and aquatic life in the Bay suffer because of excess nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment. Pollutants from the watershed are carried down to the Chesapeake Bay where they impact water quality and aquatic life.</p>

<p>Algae feed off excess nutrients in greater numbers, starving streams of oxygen and killing off aquatic species. This lack of oxygen creates even more significant problems in the Bay&mdash;large dead zones where life cannot be sustained. Excess nutrients and sediment also cloud the water, suffocating oysters and bottom dwelling life while impacting underwater grasses, a critical habitat for blue crabs and other life in the Bay.</p>

<p><u>What&rsquo;s Being Done About it</u></p>

<p>In 2010, Pennsylvania and the other watershed states (including Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, New York, and West Virginia) and the District of Columbia voluntarily entered the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) with set pollution goals to be accomplished by the end of 2025. The Chesapeake Bay TMDL established strict limits on nutrients and sediments entering the Chesapeake Bay, and tasked each watershed state with reaching a certain amount of pollution reduction, in proportion to the pollution it added to the Bay. Each Bay state developed its own roadmap for meeting those pollution reduction goals, which are known as Watershed Implementation Plans.</p>

<p>These plans are developed with guidance and in coordination with the federal Environmental Protection Agency. This planning process was broken up into three phases, and states entered the final phase, or Phase 3, in 2019 when Pennsylvania&rsquo;s final Watershed Implementation Plan was submitted to EPA. The Phase 1 and Phase 2 Watershed Implementation Plans were submitted in 2011 and 2012, respectively.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Phase 3 WIP failed to meet previously-agreed upon goals to limit nitrogen pollution and, in response, <a href=""https://www.bayjournal.com/news/policy/epa-hit-with-lawsuits-over-chesapeake-bay-cleanup/article_db7ad7e0-f429-11ea-833a-87109c15a521.html"">two lawsuits were filed against EPA</a> for these shortcomings, including one from the states of Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. That brings us to the current situation, wherein Pennsylvania&rsquo;s DEP submitted an amendment to the EPA which rectifies the nitrogen shortfalls.</p>

<p><u>The Amendment</u></p>

<p>The good news is the amendment gets Pennsylvania to meet 100% of our nitrogen goal. The 2019 Phase 3 WIP fell short by 9.8 million pounds in addressing nitrogen reductions. The nitrogen gap has been solved by efforts at the county level to establish County Action Plans, or CAPs, a critical component to successful implementation.</p>

<p>The bad news is that, since 2010, Pennsylvania has consistently fallen significantly short of meeting our clean water goals, and lawmakers in Harrisburg have shown little appetite in properly funding the programs and agencies tasked with achieving our clean water goals.</p>

<p>The decision to shift planning efforts to the county level occurred during the Phase 3 WIP development process, as Pennsylvania was asked by EPA to show how the state will meet its 2025 goals at the local level. To support local efforts, DEP developed the Community Clean Water Planning Guide and each county planning team received county specific planning tools, templates, a customized technical toolbox, and technical support resources.</p>

<p>Starting with just four pilot counties during the development of the Phase 3 WIP, now there are a total of 34 County Action Plans that were established at the county level by local leaders and stakeholders that identify the practices and resources needed to improve their local waters and achieve their target.</p>

<p>Nine counties do not have a CAP because they are considered &ldquo;minimal loading&rdquo; counties. DEP determined these nine counties will be able to achieve necessary nutrient reductions by continuing to implement their existing programs and practices without a CAP. Most of these counties are located at the edge of the watershed with only a fraction of the county falling within the watershed boundary.</p>

<p>To further ensure success with county level planning efforts, the DEP recognized the need for coordinators to facilitate and track planning and implementation. In response, DEP used federal funding from the EPA to hire two coordinators, and due to gaps in federal funding in 2019 and 2020, used state funding for 18 coordinators working at the county level. DEP&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Office meets weekly with the counties, developed the Clean Water Academy training resources, and has established the CAP Implementation Grant program to help fund local practices.</p>

<p>As more local CAPs have been developed, DEP has increased funding to county efforts over the past 3 years between the CAP Coordinator Grants and the Implementation Grants, from $1.5 million to $7 million to over $15 million.</p>

<p><u>Legislative Action is Urgently Needed</u></p>

<p>Despite all the forward momentum and local engagement and planning efforts, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s sizable funding gap remains left unaddressed. The amended Phase 3 WIP still identifies an annual funding gap at $325 million. In fact, little action has occurred over the past 2 years to address the gap.</p>

<p>Until our elected officials in Harrisburg put in place legislation that protects and funds the health of our waterways, we will continue to miss our clean water goals and the quality of our streams will continue to suffer. That&rsquo;s why last year PennFuture released a policy agenda designed to give Pennsylvania lawmakers a roadmap to fund clean water programs and to get us back on track toward meeting our obligations to clean up the Bay.</p>

<p>Titled <a href=""/Files/Admin/Final-Chesapeake-report.pdf"">&ldquo;Underfunded and Polluted: Solutions to Fund Clean Water in Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake Bay Watershed,&rdquo;</a> our report puts forth a legislative agenda that, if acted upon, would provide the technical assistance, agency support, and public investments needed to put Pennsylvania on the path toward meeting the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load, or the so-called &ldquo;pollution diet&rdquo; goals, by its 2025 end date.</p>

<p>The legislature is sitting on two critical pieces of legislation that would help to narrow the funding gap. Senate Bill 832 would create a Clean Streams Fund, dedicating $250 million from the American Rescue Plan toward various clean-water initiatives. Senate Bill 525 would reinvigorate Growing Greener, a successful conservation program tasked with watershed protection and restoration. After years of reduced funding, the bill would infuse $500 million of ARP funds into a third iteration of the Growing Greener program.</p>

<p>Additionally, the House is considering Senate Bill 251 which seeks to implement new standards and regulations on lawn fertilizer application across Pennsylvania. If passed, SB 251 would significantly improve our water quality impacted by nutrient pollution in Pennsylvania. Over 2,600 miles of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s streams are impaired due to excess nutrients, which is the 5th leading cause. One source of excess nutrients comes from applying excess fertilizer.</p>

<p>We applaud the DEP and counties for their efforts to clean up our local rivers and streams. Pennsylvania still has a long way to go to meet our 2025 goals. The fate of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s waterways, and the Chesapeake Bay, rests largely in the hands of the General Assembly.</p>
